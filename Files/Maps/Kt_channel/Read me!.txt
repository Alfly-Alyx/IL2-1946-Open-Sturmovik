This is a small English Channel style map bsed to default net8islands (Pacific Islands)map.
It is only  for 4.09 beta, because of Slovakia objects.

 Manual installation:

 Put Kt_channel Folder in to your Ubisoft\IL-2 Sturmovik 1946\MODS\MAPMODS\maps folder.
Add these lines to Ubisoft\IL-2 Sturmovik 1946\MODS\MAPMODS\maps\all.ini (copy/paste):

Kt_channel	Kt_channel/load.ini

 I have included some missions too. You find them  here in  Kt_missions folder. Copy/paste that folder in
IL-2 Sturmovik 1946\missions\single\NN and you should see them in single missions under None nation.

KT_Channel and mission generators:

You can replace  original \Ubisoft\IL-2 Sturmovik 1946\MODS\MAPMODS\maps\net8islands 
with this map. 
Then you can use mission generators like Uberdemons Misission generator, Mission Mate,
IL2 Quick mission builder and even Lowengrins DCG.

Instructions: 

1. Back up original net8islands folder. 
(You can just rename it to ;net8islands or  cut/paste it to somewhere else)
2. Rename Kt_channel folder to net8islands.
Launch IL2 and select QMB (quick mission builder) and select and select pacific islands as map
and you should be flying over European style channel!

Happy flying!
CHEERS Kapteeni!
