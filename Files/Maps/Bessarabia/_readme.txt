The Bessarabia map sadly seems to be half forgotten. The map is nicely done, but population is quite thin and there are only big citys and no small villages. 

So i closed the widest gaps between the buildings in the towns and added a few thousend small villages too. All together i added 628.134 buildings and planted 115.058 tree groups. Total number of objects is about a million now. So the map looks more populated and, as i hope, is more interesting.

I also added the new villages to the overview/mini map.

Installation: Fly_zo made an installer again (Many thanks), just use that. It installs in to the "original" mapmods folder, so when playing online it is compatible to players without that special map mod. Such a player will not see the added buildings and villages of course. To return to the original version just delete all files in the mods\mapmods\maps\Bessarabia folder except the "load.ini".
