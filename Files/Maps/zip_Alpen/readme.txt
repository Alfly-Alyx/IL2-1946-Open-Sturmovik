zip_Alpen Beta2

Download the Beta2 here


or


here.

-------------------------------------

Installation: Unzip the zip_Alpen.zip as a folder zip_Alpen to your ...\mods\mapmods\maps folder. 

If you have installed the previous version just overwrite.

Add the following line somewhere in the all.ini in your ...\mods\mapmods\maps folder:

zip_Alpen zip_Alpen/zip_Alpen_load.ini

Thats all.

-------------------------------------

Changes to previous Beta:

Population of Augsburg, Milano, Muenchen and Wien more then halved, Industry excepted, for better framerates. 

Venice reworked and populated; narrow channels at perfect mode only.

Airports at Augsburg, Muenchen-Riehm and Memingen created by JV69_BADA. Many thanks, Bada!

Swiss castels created by Lowfighter added. Many thanks, Lowfighter!

Highway-airport between Muenchen and Augsburg and airport near Treviso added.

Castle Vauban added.

Roads cleared from buildings, rivers & lakes recleared with a better tool.

Zooming memory error fixed. Return-to-FMB-error may still occur. You avoid this saving a mission, leaving the FMB and start the mission from the main menue. Ask Mister Maddox to fix that ;-)

Some sightseeing points added.

Some million trees planted at higher regions.

Hill at airport Muenchen-Suedwest ironed.

Some roads and rails fixed, some river sections smoothed.

One tree on a runway felled.

New map_f for excellent mode (Still quite bad, sorry)

Some textures changed.

Typo in hight_table.pdf fixed.

A lot of other fixes and little changes.

---------------------------------------

Fixing the water issue

When flying low over water in the hight you may notice ugly black strips at the lakes banks. When flying very low over the water in the hight your plane may crash without any notable reason and there are some other strange issues. To solve all that set "water = 1" in the games conf.ini. You can use the "L46Witcher.exe for that, you will find it in your Zip_Alpen folder. Place it in the games mainfolder, create a link to your desktop if you want and run it. It will save your original conf.ini as conf_save.ini without any change. Then it will create a new conf.ini from yours and change your water=4, water=3 or water=2 to water = 1, which will be displayed. The original value is stored in a file conf_water.ini. The next time you run the programm it will change the water back to your original value, wich is also displayed. Your original conf_safe.ini isn't touched anymore. This works when using the better openGL-setting instead of the DirectX-setting. You will need this also with any other map where the water is not just at hight 0. In my opinion there is no notable difference between the water settings exept bow and stern wash.

----------------------------------------  

Using the high map

Bombers and divebombers need to know the hight of the aim. Open the zip_Alpen_height_map.xcf with gimp. Select the color picker and pick at aims position. Read colour value from pickers info box. Open hight_table.pdf and read assigned hight from the hight_table.pdf. Maybe someone can change the xcf to other formats like photoshop.

----------------------------------------

More sightseeing & military objects needed!

There are still very few castles and other famous buildings on that map and there are no military installations like marshalling yards, radar stations or fortifications. Especially castle Neuschwanstein is missed ;-) If you build such objects within your missions (even with an other map!), please send me your .mis file. I will extract this objects, add them to the map and publish a new version from time to time. You will be named then, of course. Nice small bridges for Venice are also needed! Someone should create them, please. All parcitipaters will get this map for free ;-)

---------------------------------------- 

Why this is still a beta:

This is mainly still a beta, because there are no railway stations. I added some hundreds or may be a thousend. This took two weeks. The next two weeks i tried to make the map run also with the stations. It still doesn't. That has nothing to do with the stations themselselves or, within reasonable limits, the size of the actors.static. This issue may occur also with any big well and diversified poulated map. It's resolvable, but this may take some time.

Lastly i prefferred the airports to the stations. That's why you get a map with airports and no stations instead with stations and no airports.

Due to that problem i couldn't improve yet some other things i planned, but i hope except the railways stations you will rank the map as mostly ready and useable. Please report issues, they will be fixed if possible.
