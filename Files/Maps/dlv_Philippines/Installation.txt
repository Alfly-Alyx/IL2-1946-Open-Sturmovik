1/ For those who have already previous version of Philippines: 

delete files of mapmods\maps\dlv_Philippines\ ... files not folder... and unzip new files in the empty folder

(nothing to change in all.ini)



2/ For new users :

create a new folder in mapmods\maps\ with name dlv_Philippines

unzip files in this new mapmods\maps\dlv_Philippines\ folder

and add these lines to all.ini :


Philippines dlv_Philippines/load.ini


Enjoy !
