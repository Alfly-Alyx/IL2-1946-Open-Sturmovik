The MOD will install on your PC 1 remade versions of the NORMANDY Map:


-- LAL_Normandie-43


The changes are:
-- Partial correction of cutting the coast
-- New terrain
-- New textures (from the Slovak community)
-- New area of application of textures
-- Removal of bases and OLEG adding historical bases
-- Added more than 50 sites remarkable real (castles, mines, ports, indutrielles Zones ...)
-- New mini-map
-- New altitude clouds unpublished
-- Off parking on all possible bases for humans


To install the card:
-- You should have a beta version 4.09m or final installed. This card is not compatible with the 4.08m.
-- You need to install any version of the MOD-Son of SG2_Wasy and Tiger 33:
-- You must install the new file Wrapper.dll ('s happening filelist.txt file).

2. Add these lines in the file content ALL.INI normally MODS / MAPS (it can be stored elsewhere):

A large ... As I say, a HUGE THANK BADA without whom the compilation of data would have been impossible.

Thank you all for the information that you sent me to make this possible map
I also thank HALLY who guided me throughout this achievement having never set foot in Normandy (shame on me!).
