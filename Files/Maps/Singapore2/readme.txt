There are two possible ways to do this depending on the files you have...

--If you have a "Singapore" folder already in your "MAPS" folder then put the "load2" file into your "singapore folder (be sure to backup/save your original .ini file).

--If you do NOT have a "Singapore" folder already in your "Maps" folder then put my "Singapore" folder (with "load2" file inside) into your "MAPS" folder... MODS/MAPMODS/MAPS/singapore


Changing the load.ini textures is fairly easy.  You can try it yourself and experiment with different textures.  Just double-click the "load.ini" file and it will show listing of all the land textures (fields), forest, water, roads, etc. etc.  You can then look at other maps' "load.ini" files and copy and paste these textures into your singapore load.ini file.  You can see, for example, I pasted the Italy forest into the [WOOD] section but kept the original Jungle forest...I just seperated the two with a ";"

Any time you place a ";" in front of a line then that line will not be read by IL2.

I did this with the water...I thought (and some others agree) that the Pacificwater is too bright blue to use for the "muddy rivers" so I put ";" in front of those lines and used "Water = water/water.tga" which is the european darker water.  You can change this back to suit your tastes.

I tried to use the Slovakia roads, highways, and railroads but these will not work on this map.  Probably because it is Old.  I could see these roads but when zooming in I would get a black screen so I kept the original roads.

I'm not sure if this newer "darker" map is what you're looking for.  This is just the simple way I know how to change it.  I'm not an expert map-maker like some of these other guys :)

Oh, this "load2" file is for the map named "singapore 2".

If you have any questions just send me a private message and I'll try to help...or I'll get someone else to help us.

Good luck,
