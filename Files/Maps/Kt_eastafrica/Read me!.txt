 Version 0.91 Beta
Whats new:
Load.ini error fixed with FLy_zo:s Load.ini (THX Fly_Z ;)
Minimap (ed_mO1 and ed_mO2) has now road/railroad

Manual Installation:
Exctract Kt_eastafrica folder to:\Ubisoft\IL-2 Sturmovik 1946\MODS\MAPMODS.
Add this line to Ubisoft\IL-2 Sturmovik 1946\MODS\MAPMODS\all.ini ( copy/paste):

Kt_eastafrica	Kt_eastafrica/load.ini

Disclaimer: 
I provide this map as it is with all its historical/geographical errors. 
It is based to default sandsoftime map so it is  quite small. 
It can be played with IL2 409 modded beta with excellent settings, 
but it is ment to work best with perfect graphics settings.
My system is AMD 4000+ (single core) 2 gig RAM Win XP pro with nvidia 8800 GT. 
So it can be played with middle range pc:s.


Kt_eastfrica and mission generators:

Kt_eastafrica map is compatible with Uberdemons Mission Generator, Grazy Schmidths Mission Mate, 
IL2 Quick mission builder and Lowengrins DCG. 
You just need to:

1. back up  original Sandsoftime map,  
(rename it to ;sandsoftime)
 
2. copy Kt_eastafrica folder

3. rename  copied Kt_eastafrica folder to sandsoftime.

If you use DCG you must edit either tobruk 41.mis or tobruk 43.mis missions.
You find these missions at \dcgen\Masters folder. 
Remove all the ships because otherwise you see some strange desertships. 

Or you can make new campaign from sctratch.

I would like to express my graditude to AAA community members for making this map possible. 

And Thank you Oleg Maddox and 1C team for best ever combat sim!

Happy flying!
