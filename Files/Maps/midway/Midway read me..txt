This is my pacific water mod for the BP_Midway map.
For this mod to work you must download BP_Midway from AAA

Credit for the map goes to Boosher for creating it and panzerkeil 
for his static actors.

There are five different shallow water tga's to use.

Credits for water color goes to Viking.
I made the shallow water tga's and put the two together.


"FORE WARNING"- The water looks alot better the more you adjust your weather conditions.

Install- Place the midway folder in you Mods/MapMods/Maps folder and the Bombsaways_Tarawa 
in the Mods/MapMods/_Tex folder

Uninstall- Rename the midway folder to -midway or delete the midway folder from you Mods/MapMods/Maps folder
and the Bombsaway_Tarawa from your Mods/MapMods/Maps/_Tex folder and your BP_Midway map will revert to its original 
colors.

To use different tga's open the Tarawa folder and open the Loadini with note pad, go
to the bottom of the list and you will see...

Water2 = Bombsaways_Tarawa/Tarawa/Shallows1a_Fields_A.tga
;Water2 = Bombsaways_Tarawa/Tarawa/Shallows2a_Fields_A.tga
;Water2 = Bombsaways_Tarawa/Tarawa/Shallows3a_Fields_A.tga
;Water2 = Bombsaways_Tarawa/Tarawa/Shallows4a_Fields_A.tga
;Water2 = Bombsaways_Tarawa/Tarawa/Shallows5a_Fields_A.tga
;Water3   = land/summer/grnd/fields_proc013.tga
Water3   = water/Beach.tga

To activate a tga remove the ; from the begining of the entry and put one
in front the one that did not have it. This way you can customize the shallow 
water to your liking.
