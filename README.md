# Open-Sturmovik

WIP for the 1.1 Patch
Roadmap:

    Clean duplicate files between the original game and Open Sturmovik.
    Ensure all files load correctly during startup.

    Move all .pdf, .doc, and .rtf files from the root folder to a dedicated "Documentation" folder.

Roadmap for Patch 1.2:

    Update libraries.
    Update executables.
    Add new content.
