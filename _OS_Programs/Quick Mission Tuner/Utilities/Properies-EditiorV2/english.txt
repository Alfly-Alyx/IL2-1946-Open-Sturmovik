quote Madbran:

i've wrote this utility for editing briefing in mission file because
i find it's too "fat" to editing with il2FB and so i use too
FBDaemon tool and for this there is just notepad !!! (not very easy too)

for use, u open .propertie files in directory of mission file, it's very
simple to use !!!
u modify or create text briefing and save in same directory of .mis file
and it's all !!

Short is the title of mission
Brief is the text you see when you launch a coop mission with IL2FB
Description is the general text you see when you connect to server
All is the general axes text you see when you connect to server
Red, Bleu , Green is the text you see when you select one of the axes

For the rest, if you move mouse in soft, you can see hint who help you
for the rest of different command !!

generaly , command is :
left mouse click : select/deselect area,
+/- : increase/decrease +/- 1 counter in FBDaemon tab and difficulty editor
PgUp/PgDown : increase/decrease +/- 10 counter in FBDaemon tab and difficulty editor

Difficulty executable is for fixed difficulty level, Dot Range and max ping
you can load in IL2FB mission with "f" command or "file" command
(ex : "file default.difficulty " in script when you launch dedicated server)
if you use FBDaemon V2.4 , difficulty file is launch when you launch
mission file
difficulty file MUST be in the same directory that mission file and properties file.

For FBDaemon , you can see an explain in http://www.greatergreen.com/fbd2/

I wish that you understand that i explain.
cheers
