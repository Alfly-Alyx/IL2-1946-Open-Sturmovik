To use also the standard maps throw folder maps into the games folder
  ..\mods\mapmods\. To add airportfiles to new installed modmads, take
  their actors.static file. Throw it into the subfolder ..\mods\mapmods\newmap
 (comming with the folder maps) and rename it as "actors.static", if this
 file is named somehow otherwise. Run outact.bat. Throw resulting
 outNStationary.txt into the folder of the added map.
 

Main changes in V1.0:

Completely new map selection procedure
Two more zooms (Zoom * 4 can't display the biggest maps)
Zoom holds focus on last left/right mouse click
Smaller compass rose and, well, this other thing ..
New airports ;-)
