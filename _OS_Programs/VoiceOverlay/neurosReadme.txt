Voice Overlay is an alternative to the well know TS overlay. Personally, I use TSO and I like that one better, but VO have one important feature that many people need: it works with Vista!

Install: drop the whole folder into your Program Files directory (or run VO right off this folder) and make all the appropriate shortcuts
