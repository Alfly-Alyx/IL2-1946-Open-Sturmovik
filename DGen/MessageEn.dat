		 Translation guidelines. 

	Every line not starting with symbol < will be ignored. You may use it for comments.
 	Otherwise every message consists of two parts: message ID and Message text,
	both in < > brackets.

	For every ID code there may be up to 10 variants of texts - one will be picked up randomly.
	You don't need to translate every line exactly, you just need to describe the same situation.

	Symbols \n and %s must be left intact. \n means new line, %s means that some substring will be 
	placed there - usually town name. Some lines have space in the end. Please leave it in place -
	it means that there will be another sentence that will continue the briefing. The space separates them. 

	Message texts cannot contain new lines - make them as long as you need (but not longer than 256 chars).

<Normandy41DeBr> <The RAF is trying to provoke us. They are sending small flights of bombers escorted by large numbers of Spitfires. Let us show them that their attempts are useless.>
<Normandy41DeDb> <The RAF rodeo flights are proving to be a nightmare for British pilots. The circus is ours!>
<Normandy42DeBr> <Now we are going to teach a lesson to the RAF. Our new fighter is arriving: the FW 190A is even better than our Me 109s, and the allied pilots shall be surprised!>
<Normandy42DeDb> <Well our FW 190s did in fact outperform the Spitfire MkV. But we hear the RAF is going to receive a new model soon, the Spifire MkIX. We shall step up our efforts even further, to maintain air superiority over the Channel for the Luftwaffe.>
<Normandy42WDeBr> <Now we hear that the Amerikaners are going to launch massive raids of heavy bombers over France, in broad daylight. They are crazy! Our fighters will have a lot of kill opportunities.>
<Normandy42WDeDb> <Well the B-17s are quite difficult to bring down after all. Fortunately their escort fighters have a limited range, and we are able to cause great damage in their box formations.>
<Normandy43DeBr> <A new enemy is showing up in the skies: US made fighters! Fortunately their P-38s and P-47s are pitiful and really no good at dogfighting. Their pilots lack experience, and we are going to smash these Indianers out of the sky!>
<Normandy43DeDb> <Well enough. The Thunderbolts and Lightnings have improved, their pilots too. And from now on we shall encounter a very dangerous breed of new fighters, the P-51 Mustangs. Our experten and their fighters are far superior however, and we are still able to repel the invaders.>
<Normandy43WDeBr> <The enemy is getting very aggressive. The overwhelming outnumbering of our fighters by the allied air forces, who relentlessly attack us with any type of fighters, starts to represent a real challenge even for our experten.>
<Normandy43WDeDb> <The number of allied four engine heavy bombers B-17s and B-24s still keeps on growing. We desperately want more firepower for us and better protected aicraft. Allied fighters also start to be more effective and we badly need the new German models to continue fighting increasingly difficult air battles.>
<Normandy44DeBr> <It is quite obvious that the enemy will invade soon. It is not entirely clear where this invasion will take place, but the Americans and British are stepping up their air campaign against targets in France. Their bombers come in ever larger numbers. The Luftwaffe will try to defend military targets in France but has to conserve its strength for the invasion.>
<Normandy44DeDb> <The invasion has begun! Enemy troops have landed at serveral places in Normandy. All available Luftwaffe forces will transfer to France to repel the invasion!>
<Normandy_DDayDeBr> <A few days ago, the British and Americans invaded France in Normandy. All available Luftwaffe fighter units have been ordered to hastily transfer to grass strips in France and are now under command of Luftflotte 2. Our main tasks will be air cover for German troops in France and attacks against enemy troops. The enemy air force is numerically very superior and the hasty transfer and lack of coordination has already resulted in heavy equipment losses. Nethertheless, we must do our duty.>
<Normandy_DDayDeDb> <The enemy air superiority proved too much for Luftflotte 2. Constant attacks on our airfields and lopsided air combat against much stronger enemies have led to catastrophic losses with our fighter units. The bombers were even worse off: They were mostly totally annihilated. Without air cover, our troops were not able to contain the enemy beachhad. Much of our armored forces were caught in a huge annihilation battle near Falaise and lost all their vehicles. The Wehrmacht is abandoning France and will try to make a stand at the German border. The shattered units of Luftflotte 2 will be rebuilt and used for home defense. The planes maybe replaceable, but we have lost many experienced pilots as well, which are impossible to replace.>

<Channel_44UsBr> <After almost two years of planning, the invasion of Europe will begin soon. In order to prepare for the invasion our Air Force will attack targets in the rear area of potential invasion areas. Main objectives are communications and logistics of the German troops based in France. Another goal is to weaken the Luftwaffe forces in France.>
<Channel_44UsDb> <The 8th Air Force has flown numerous raids on targets in Normandy and around Calais, severely weakening the German supply network in France. Even more important, these raids were a good chance for our pilots to gain experience. Also, the intensified raids have prompted the Germans to weaken their home defense units in favor of basing more planes in France>
<ChannelDDayUsBr> <Operation Overlord, the Invasion of France, has begun! After joining up the five beaches and establishing a firm bridgehead covering 50 miles along the Channel coastline, we continue our offensive. Whilst the British strike in the Caen direction, drawing the German tank divisions around the regional capital, our forces broke out from Utah towards Barneville to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula. Your unit is one of the first of the 9th AAF and 2nd allied TAF to be based on an advanced landing ground in Normandy. Your main task is to fly tactical support for the troops and defend the invasion ports and troops from German raids. Heavy Luftwaffe resistance is to be expected.>
<ChannelDDayUsDb> <After being stuck in the Bocage for several weeks, US troops finally broke out during Operation Cobra. After failed German counterattacks at Mortain, General Patton's enveloping maneuver caught the German forces in Normandy in a huge pocket near Falaise. Tactical airpower helped to reduce this pocket to rubble, and even if hundreds of thousands of German soldiers escaped, their entire equipment and weapons were lost. The German army is in full retreat all across France and Paris is due to be liberated soon. Tactical airpower had a huge part in this success.

<BalatonSommer44DeBr> <Defend the Reich from Hungary. We must absolutely stop these allied bombings.>
<BalatonSommer44DeDb> <Our efforts seem to have been useless. Nevertheless we must continue the fighting !>

<BerlinwsDeBr> <We are transferred to Berlin, to protect the heart of our homeland. With our new Ta-152 fighters specially designed for combat at high altitudes, you should be able to stop the allied bombers' offensive !>
<BerlinwsDeDb> < >

<Berlinws2DeBr> <The Russian offensive of Summer 44 had pushed us back almost to the 1937 borders of Germany. In February 1945, the Soviets attacked East Prussia. The Kriegsmarine launched an all out effort to save as many soldiers and civilians as possible, and the fighting over a small bridgehead near Pillau is still ongoing, as well as on Hela. The Soviets will soon launch their final offensive on Berlin. After the Ardennes offensive and the failed Operation Bodenplatte, most RLV fighter units have been assigned to the East front, leaving the defence against the US air raids to the Jet fighters of JG 7. Luftflotte 6 has an impressive order of battle, more units ever since Operation Barbarossa. But most units are understrength, short on fuel and have only novice pilots. The key of success will be the Oder crossings. If we can destroy the Bridges across the Oder, the Soviets will not be able to advance. Gefechtsverband Bohrmann is tasked with that, and all fighter units will support it, as well as fly Jabo missions against Soviet troops. Air supremacy is only a secondary task, due to the huge enemy advantage in numbers. This is going to be our last stand. Especially since the treacherous murder attempt on 20th July last year, the Fhrer expects fanatical resistance and total devotion to duty!>
<Berlinws2DeDb> <In late February, the Soviets crossed the Oder. An intense air campaign during which every possible weapon was used against the bridges began. However, it proved impossible to destroy the bridges permanently. A last major defensive battle at the Seelower Hhen didn't buy much time and Berlin was surrounded by end of March. The Luftwaffe did what it could, mostly close support missions, but was not able to make any difference. On 2nd May finally, the Fhrer died in his Bunker and the city surrendered. Karl Dnitz, his successor, has build a provisional government in Flensburg and tries to salvage what is possible from the East, but the war is lost. Six years of war and so many lives have been lost in vain.>

<France44DeBr> <It is quite obvious that the enemy will invade soon. It is not entirely clear where this invasion will take place, but the Americans and British are stepping up their air campaign against targets in France.

<NormandyDeBr> <A few days ago, the British and Americans invaded France in Normandy. All available Luftwaffe fighter units have been ordered to hastily transfer to grass strips in France and are now under command of Luftflotte 2. Our main tasks will be air cover for German troops in France and attacks against enemy troops. The enemy air force is numerically very superior and the hasty transfer and lack of coordination has already resulted in heavy equipment losses. Nethertheless, we must do our duty.>
<NormandyDeDb> <The enemy air superiority proved too much for Luftflotte 2. Constant attacks on our airfields and lopsided air combat against much stronger enemies have led to catastrophic losses with our fighter units. The bombers were even worse off: They were mostly totally annihilated. Without air cover, our troops were not able to contain the enemy beachhad. Much of our armored forces were caught in a huge annihilation battle near Falaise and lost all their vehicles. The Wehrmacht is abandoning France and will try to make a stand at the German border. The shattered units of Luftflotte 2 will be rebuilt and used for home defense. The planes maybe replaceable, but we have lost many experienced pilots as well, which are impossible to replace.>

<BerlinAir44UsBr> <Simultanously with the invasion, the strategic air raids against German industrial targets continued in full force. The 8th AAF is still raiding targets around Berlin, and due to losses over France, Luftwaffe opposition has become much weaker than in Spring. However, bombing Berlin is still no Milk run and the fighter units of the 8th AAF still have to escort the Fortresses. During your tour, you will fly strategic escort missions deep into Germany.>
<BerlinAir44UsDb> <Congratulations, you completed your tour of Duty with the 8th! While German fighter opposition got stronger again in Fall of 1944, the quality of German pilots is obviously lower than before. Better US escort tactics and poor weather have also helped to ensure the 8th's success in the bombing of industrial targets. But still, our losses were severe, especially in bombers. While the Germans have apparently developed new rocket and jet fighters far superior to any other plane, they have so far failed to use them in an effective way.>
<BerlinAir44DeBr> <After the blood bath of Normandy, most fighter units have been rebuild using newly trained pilots with little flying experience or by disbanding bomber and transport units. These fighter units will now be used in the Reichsluftverteidigung, defending Germany against the American daylight raids. While intercepting such a raid was already tough in Spring, it became even tougher now with more and improved enemy Mustang fighters and even greater numbers of bombers. We must rely und good coordination and tactics in order to be successful.>
<BerlinAir44DeDb> <The fall battles over Berlin turned into the largest and bloodiest air battles ever fought. Our losses were horrible, especially among the new pilts, but still many enemy bombers were shot down. The air war over Germany is turning into a war of attrition, but it is dubvious that we can win such a war. We need new and superior weapons in order to win back air superiority over Germany. Such weapons are in development, but we have to old the line with what we have until they are ready.>
<BalatonAir44UsBr> <After Rumania changed sides in August 1945, the 15th AAF had to change objectives. Based on the huge airbase in Foggia on the italian adriatic coast, it will now strike Germany and Hungary, its only remaining ally from the south. Important targets are German industry in Austria but also the Capital of Hungary, Budapest. The hungarian Ruler, Admiral Horthy, is considering a seperate peace with the allies and bombing Hungary may reinforce his will for peace. The fighter units of the 15th AAF, now mostly equipped with Mustangs instead of Lightnings, will escort the 15th's Bombers to Hungary. Heavy resistance from German and hungarian air forces is likely.>
<BalatonAir44UsDb> <In November 1944, a group of pro German officers staged a coup against Horthy, ruining any chance of a seperate peace with Hungary. Even though the Germans have occupied the country, the hungarian military continues fighting. This leaves no other way than letting the Russians occupy that country. The 15th AAF has performed well, though, carrying out bombing raids against heavy resistance.>
<BalatonAir44DeBr> <American bombers based in Italy have started to raid Budapest. Since there is not much important industry, it is most likely a moral bombing in order to drive our last ally out of the war. However, the hungarian military is firmly at our side and a joint command, Jaf Ungarn, have been set up to coordinate both German and hungarian interceptors against the Fortresses.>
<BalatonAir44DeDb> <The units of Fliegerfhrer Ungarn have been quite successful in shooting down US bombers. Losses were heavy, but not as disastrous as in the home defence. Our hungarian comrades have given us great support, despite the chaotic political situation in Hungary. This situation has forces us to occupy the country. The US bombing raids have now shifted to Austria, so most German units based in Hungary will leave either for home defense or the east front, which is coming closer.>
<ArdennesDeBr> <Today, on December 16, 1944, at 0530, our offensive in the West has begun. Eight Panzer and thirteen Infantry divisions are attacking the relatively undefended Ardennes sector. Their goal: To drive a wedge towards Antwerp and cut off enemy troops in the Netherlands and Belgium. Luftflotte Reich almost had to cease interception of US raids and transferred the major portion of its remaining units to bases in western Germany. We will make a maximum effort to support this offensive. Most of our missions will be hampered by bad weather, though.>
<ArdennesDeDb> <The Ardennes offensive has failed. Our troops were not able to take Bastogne and got bogged down due to lack of fuel and endless air attacks. With its untrained pilots, the Luftwaffe was not able to properly support the ground troops, resulting in heavy losses in planes and pilots. On New Year's Day 1945, the Luftwaffe made a last, massive attack against allied airfields, Operation Bodenplatte. While our pilots managed to destroy a lot of enemy planes on the ground, enemy and friendly Flak caused crippling losses. The remainder of our planes will be transferred to the east front.>

<ArdennesUsBr> <Today, on December 16, 1944, the 5th and 6th German Panzer armies broke into the Ardennes through the Loshein Gap against our divisions protecting the region. The Sixth Panzer army attacking our V Corps at Elsborn Ridge accomplished little. At the same time the 5th Panzer Army, attacking the VIII Corps exploited it's lack of experience and is making quick advance. We must slow the Germans down in order to organise defense of Bastogne and prepare a counterattack. The task of allied tactical airpower will be constant attacks against enemy rear areas and securing air superiority.>
<ArdennesUsDb> <The enemy failed to take Bastogne and got bogged down by ceaseless air attacks and heroic resistance. The allied tactical air forces swept the Luftwaffe from the skies and effectively supported our counterattack. The Luftwaffe tried a suprise strike on New Year 1945, but our losses were quickly replaced. After that, the enemy has almost vanished from the air. Victory is close at hand now!>
<BerlinAir45UsBr> <The Ardennes offensive has been repulsed and the russian Army is closing on Berlin. Still, the 8th Air Force is constantly bombing the city. During recent days, the enemy has started to emply Jet fighters to attack our bombers. Use team work to defeat these Me 262s which are causing losses among our bombers.>
<BerlinAir45UsDb> <The Jet menace was finally ended in a series of massive air raids against their bases which forced the Jet units to abandon their bases around Berlin and evacuate farther south, where they cannot harm anybody. With the russians in Berlin, the war is almost over and we can all go home soon!>
<BerlinAir45DeBr> <After the failed operation Bodenplatte, almost all surviving fighter units have been transferred to Luftflotte 6 on the east front. One of the few units still intercepting the Americans are the two Gruppen of Jagdgeschwader 7. Equipped with Me 262 Jet fighters and led by some of the most able Officers in the Luftwaffe, JG 7 has just become operational. It may be too late, but at least we can show the Amis that we can still fight!>
<BerlinAir45DeDb> <The Me 262s of JG 7 turned out to be an extremely efficient weapon against US bombers. Especially when using the newly developed rocket weapons, they scored many kills. After the Americans realized the threat from the Jets, they literally bombed their bases to pieces. JG 7  had to evacuate the area around Berlin and flee to Prague, where it is essentially grounded due to lack of fuel and an uprising going on in the city. For JG 7, the war is over. It had a brief, but spectacular history.>

<Lvov41DeBr> <On 22nd June 1941, our offensive against Stalin's Soviet Union will begin! Our forces, together with our allies from Finland, Rumania, Slovakia and Hungary, will attack along the entire Soviet western border. As a part of Luftflotte 2, our first task is to secure air supremacy in area around Lemberg. According to intelligence reports, much of the Soviet air force is concentrated on forward air fields. Our first task will be to put the Soviet planes out of action, preferably on the ground, then we will directly support our advancing armoured spearheads of Heeresgruppe Mitte. With luck, we will be in Moscow in a few months!>
<Lvov41DeDb> <The German attack was totally successful. Heeresgruppe Mitte took Lemberg after a few days. Luftflotte 2 was instrumental in this success. As on other parts of the front, the total of destroyed enemy planes is almost incredible, several thousands on the ground alone. The fighter units also maintained air cover above our troops by shooting down hundreds of attacking Soviet bombers. Our troops continue to advance deeper and deeper into Soviet territory. The Soviet resistance in the air has almost ceased, while on the ground numerous, but ill trained and equipped Soviet troops offer heavy resistance. The Luftwaffe is the decisive force in this ground war and we have to keep up our efforts to keep the pace of our advance.>
<Lvov41RuBr> <As a part of 15 SAD of the Kiev Special Military District, our unit is based on a forward airfield in the area of Lvov in the western Ukraine. High command has ordered us to maintain a high state of readiness, since strong German troops have deployed in the border area. But we are also under strict order not to engage in any activity that could be interpreted as hostile by a clique of revisionist German generals who want to provoke Hitler into a war with us.>
<Lvov41RuDb> <On the morning of June 22nd, the German forces attacked. The attack came as a total surprise and resulted in heavy losses. Lvov was lost after several days of fighting to the Germans, who were assisted by anti-Soviet Ukrainian nationalists. They committed many atrocities there and everywhere else. The VVS took extremely heavy losses, mainly on the ground due to surprise attacks. In the air, the VVS fought bravely and made the Germans pay a heavy price for their aggression.>

As on other parts of the front, the total of destroyed enemy planes is almost incredible, several thousands on the ground alone. The fighter units also maintained air cover above our troops by shooting down hundreds of attacking Soviet bombers. Our troops continue to advance deeper and deeper into Soviet territory. The Soviet resistance in the air has almost ceased, while on the ground numerous, but ill trained and equipped Soviet troops offer heavy resistance. The Luftwaffe is the decisive force in this ground war and we have to keep up our efforts to keep the pace of our advance.>
<Lvov41HRuBr> <As a part of 15 SAD of the Kiev Special Military District, our unit is based on a forward airfield in the area of Lvov in the western Ukraine. High command has ordered us to maintain a high state of readiness, since strong German troops have deployed in the border area. But we are also under strict order not to engage in any activity that could be interpreted as hostile by a clique of revisionist German generals who want to provoke Hitler into a war with us.>
<Lvov41HRuDb> <On the morning of June 22nd, the German forces attacked. The attack came as a total surprise and resulted in heavy losses. Lvov was lost after several days of fighting to the Germans, who were assisted by anti-Soviet Ukrainian nationalists. They committed many atrocities there and everywhere else. The VVS took extremely heavy losses, mainly on the ground due to surprise attacks. In the air, the VVS fought bravely and made the Germans pay a heavy price for their aggression.>

<Frontiers41DeBr> <On 22nd June 1941, our offensive against Stalin's Soviet Union will begin!

As a part of Luftflotte 2, our first task is to secure air supremacy in area around Lemberg. According to intelligence reports, much of the Soviet air force is concentrated on forward air fields. Our first task will be to put the Soviet planes out of action, preferably on the ground, then we will directly support our advancing armoured spearheads of Heeresgruppe Mitte.

<TyphoonDeBr> <The final push on Moscow has begun! Heeresgruppe Mitte will first attempt a giant pincer movement with the aim of enveloping the majority of the Red Army forces near Vyasma, followed by a direct thrust towards the Soviet capital. In order to succeed, Luftflotte 2 must make a maximum effort once again, even if its units, after three months of constant fighting, are only at 50 per cent strength. We have to take Moscow before the winter or Soviet reinforcements arrive and the Luftwaffe will win this race!>
<TyphoonDeDb> <We have suffered a serious defeat. While the initial pincer movement in front of Moscow was successful, annihilating yet another half million Soviet soldiers has cost Heeresgruppe Mitte much time. By the time the thrust on Moscow began, the typical Russian fall with mud and rain immobilized our forces, and by the time our offensive finally came in the vicinity of Moscow, "General Winter" struck, followed by severe Soviet counterattacks. Luftflotte 2 had already totally exhausted itself in supporting the Vyasma annihilation battle and was unable to prevent the total collapse of the front by December. While our remaining Messerschmitts still rule the sky when they are able to take off, they are almost permanently grounded due to cold and lack of spare parts, as are the bombers. The Luftflotte has nothing more to give and we can be glad if we can hold the front as it stands now. Conquering Moscow has now become all but impossible.>
<TyphoonRuBr> <After the battle of Smolensk, the German advance on Moscow is getting faster again. Stavka has decided to commit the majority of the Red Army  of the western front west of Vyasma in a defensive position, while the Siberian forces have been ordered to transfer to the defence of Moscow. Western Front VVS and Moscow PVO have been allocated the vast majority of all modern aircraft available in the whole Soviet union and will support the defence of the Soviet capital with an all out effort. Absolute priority has the slowdown of enemy forces, as well as the defence of Moscow against enemy bombing raids. If the western front manages to delay the enemy advance until the arrival of the first snow, our Siberian forces can attempt a counterattack!>

<TyphoonHDeDb> <We have suffered a serious defeat.

While our remaining Messerschmitts still rule the sky when they are able to take off, they are almost permanently grounded due to cold and lack of spare parts, as are the bombers.

<Crimea41DeBr> <On the 5th October 1941 Wehrmacht forces reached the Sea of Azov, effectively cutting the land corridor into the Crimea and trapping Soviet forces on the peninsula. The Perekop Isthmus, only 8 km wide at its narrowest point, is once again fortified against an invader, as it was in the Civil War and by the Tatars and Greeks hundreds of years ago.It is no use - German tank forces, aided by Heinkel and Stuka bombers, have broken through the Perekop defences and have gained a foothold in the Crimea. Together with our Rumanian allies, fresh from their victory at Odessa two weeks ago, German forces are preparing to strike south at Simferopol, Crimea's capital, and Sevastopol, home of the Black Sea Fleet. Earlier this year we were involved in the victorious Greece Campaign and we have now been attached to Luftflotte 4, responsible for the Army Group South area in Operation Barbarossa - the attack on the Soviet Union. Together with the Rumanians we are holding the right flank, facing both the Red Airforce and the Black Sea Fleet air regiments. Our opponents are flying a few modern fighters such as the Yak and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of the older Polikarpov designs. Our successes so far and the high scores amassed by our pilots have been based on our skill, teamwork and determination to start every fight with the altitude advantage. >
<Crimea41DeDb> <Our forces now control the entire Crimea except for the port and city of Sevastopol, where determined Russian army and navy troops continue to defy us, backed by the determined Black Sea Fleet airforce. However winter is drawing in and the city lies besieged by German and Rumanian troops. It is time to look eastwards - north of the Crimea German forces are strectched along the Sea of Azov almost to the Don, but the Russian winter and growing Soviet strength have halted their advance. What will 1942 bring?>
<Crimea41RuBr> <The Crimea was protected by the bottleneck of the Perrekop Isthmus and our defensive lines, but the Germans and Rumanians have smashed their way through in heavy fighting. The Crimea lies open before them, with the prize of the Sevastopol Naval Base within their reach. It will be up to each one of us, the airmen of the Soviet Airforce and the Black Sea Fleet Naval Airforce, to slow down the enemy and give the defenders of Sevastopol and the Crimean capital, Simferopol, time to prepare. The Rumanians must surely have been badly weakened by their assault on Odessa earlier this month and the German supply lines are stretched to breaking point. Now is the time to deal them a bloody nose.>
<Crimea41RuDb> <Your valiant defence of the Crimea has left us in control of the port of Sevastopol but the enemy holds the rest of the Crimea, though weakly.The Germans and Rumanians surround us here and air battles continue as the weather permits, but both sides are beginning to conserve their forces for the inevitable spring push to capture the city. Yet even as the fate of Sevastopol grows desperate we hear of increasing resistance by our forces outside Moscow and Leningrad and our resolve to withstand the enemy will not falter. Indeed, plans are afoot to take advantage of the enemy's weakness in the rest of the Crimea. The coming year offers both despair and hope.>

<Crimea42DeBr> <The 11th Army of Heeresgruppe Sd had taken all of the Crimea except the port city and fortress Sevastopol in last November. However, in December and January, while the Bulk of Luftflotte 4 was fighting the Soviet counteroffensive at Rostov, the Black Sea fleet undertook amphibious landings at Kerch, Eupatoria and Feodosia. This forced Generaloberst von Manstein to cancel the assault on Sevastopol. While the landings at Eupatoria and Feodosia were quickly wiped out by makeshift battle groups formed out of rear area units, the Kerch bridgehead could not be contained. The Soviets now again control most of the Kerch peninsula and are preparing for an offensive with at least army strength in order to retake the rest of the Crimea. Also, Sevastopol remains a thorn in the side of the German forces on the Crimea. After the fighting around Rostov quieted down, Luftflotte 4 was shifted back to the Crimea, in order to support the fight against both Kerch and Sevastopol. Its main tasks are the regaining of air superiority, the interdiction of supply ships and direct support for the 11th Army under von Manstein.>
<Crimea42DeDb> <The Soviets finally lashed out from the Kerch Bridgehead in the first days of March, but their strong, but ill coordinated and planned attack did not gain much ground, mostly thanks to constant attacks of the bombers, Stukas and Schlachtflieger of Luftflotte 4. On May 7th, the German counterattack began, again heavily supported by Luftflotte 4. Airbase raids destroyed much of the Soviet air force in this area, and the Soviet front entirely broke in just about two weeks. On May 20th, Kerch finally fell after bitter house fighting. The Kerch Bridgehead had been annihilated, with over 100.000 Soviet soldiers killed or captured. Generaloberst von Manstein could resume the operations to take Sevastopol. It took a bitter two months of trench and bunker warfare and 24.000 German casualties, but on July 1st, the Battle of Sevastopol was finally over. Without constant Luftwaffe support, led by the inventor of the Blitzkrieg tactic, Generaloberst von Richthofen, it would have been impossible to take Sevastopol. The Soviet fighter pilots flew very skillful and aggressive over Sevastopol, but were finally beaten. The Heeresgruppe Mitte has already launched Operation Blau to break through to the Volga at Stalingrad.>
<Crimea42RuBr> <At the beginning of spring 1942, the situation in the Crimea looks promising for our struggle. The amphibious landings of the Black Sea fleet this winter have been successful in establishing a very strong beachhead at the Kerch Peninsula, the Tartar rampart being the front right now. Also, the fortified defences of Sevastopol, as well as the skillful air defence of VVS Black Sea fleet have proven too strong for the Germans. With our supply situation improving day by day and the Germans having a fortress in their back they are unable to bypass, the chance is there to liberate the Crimea from the German occupation! Strong air forces have been allocated to VVS Crimean front and the VVS Black Sea fleet fighter squadrons has proven themselves as a skillful force equal to all the Germans have. Soon we will launch our offensive and drive the Germans from the Crimea!>
<Crimea42RuDb> <We have suffered another defeat. Due to many mistakes made in the leadership of the Crimean front, our offensive was launched without proper coordination and intelligence and bogged down after a few days. By removing air strength from other sectors, the Luftwaffe brought together a huge air force in the Crimea, which made front movement almost impossible. The Luftwaffe simply overwhelmed the VVS Crimean front, while it fought bravely, it was destroyed. Kerch fell in the end of May. This enabled the German army commander, General von Manstein, to concentrate its forces on Sevastopol. Our troops and the VVS Black Sea fleet fought heroically, and the fleet launched a maximum effort to  supply the city. But the German strength was simply too much. At least the Fleet managed to evacuate many of the defenders in a heroic operation, but on the end the German raised their banner over Sevastopol.>

<Kuban42DeBr> <Operation Blau, Heeresgruppe Sd's break through the Don front aimed at Stalingrad, has been a huge success so far. On the southern flank of the main axis of advance, the Caucasus coast is becoming increasingly isolated. The Wehrmacht is advancing in this direction as well, aiming at the ports of the Kuban coast, where the Black Sea fleet has fled after being driven from Odessa and Sevastopol. The aim of this drive is to take the Soviet oil fields at Baku on the Caspian Sea, the main source of oil for the Soviets. The advance is slowed down by mountainous terrain. Once again, the success of this operation will depend on the air support of Luftflotte 4.>
<Kuban42DeDb> <The thrust into the Caucasus was successful. Our troops of the Gebirgsjger have put up the German flag on Mount Elbrus and our Panzer divisions are advancing towards Astrakhan. Our forces have taken the port cities on the coast.

<Kuban42RuBr> <Strong German forces have broken through the Don front and took Rostov in July. Our forces cannot stop the German advance right now.

<Kuban42RuDb> <While the Germans have penetrated deep into the Caucasus, we have been successful in establishing a fairly defendable front at the Kuban coast.

<StalingradDeBr> <Generaloberst Paulus' 6th Army is advancing on Stalingrad. We have crossed the Tchir and are heading towards the very important industrial City on the Volga. Stalingrad is important not only because of its industry, but also because it is the gate to the Caucasus. By taking it, Heeresgruppe Sd can sever the connection between the oil fields of the Caucasus and the rest of the Soviet Union. The Battle of Stalingrad may decide the whole war! Luftflotte 4 has been severely strengthened by Fliegerkorps X that had been pulled back from Sicily. The Russians know of the importance of this battle as well and both the army and the air force have been strengthened severely. The Luftwaffe will have to do its utmost to support the drive of the 6th Army in this very important battle. >
<StalingradDeDb> <The 6th Army has taken the major part of Stalingrad and has crossed the Volga at several points. Luftflotte 4 has been instrumental in this struggle. The VVS has been up in strength as never before on the southern front, with new types and much more aggressive than ever. Nevertheless, the fighters of the Luftwaffe have gained control in the air and inflicted heavy losses at a relatively light cost. Troubling us is the weather situation, which is becoming increasingly worse in the last days. If this continues, we will not be able to fly in a few days and our troops will not be able to advance further without air cover.>
<StalingradRuBr> <The Germans are advancing on Stalingrad! Stavka has transferred every air unit at hand to the Volga front. The City must not fall, because that would sever the connection between the Caucasus and the rest of the USSR, stopping our indigenous oil supply and leaving us at the mercy of oil from the western allies. To prevent that, strong forces have been allocated to this sector. The VVS, equipped with new types and with the experience gained in the struggles of over a year, will try to claim air superiority. Stalingrad must not fall!>
<StalingradRuDb> <At the beginning of October, the German advance has been almost stopped. While the Germans control a major part of Stalingrad, every inch is costing them dearly and our forces are becoming stronger day by day. Soon we will launch a counteroffensive and drive them back!>

By taking it, Heeresgruppe Sd can sever the connection between the oil fields of the Caucasus and the rest of the Soviet Union. The Battle of Stalingrad may decide the whole war! Luftflotte 4 has been severely strengthened by Fliegerkorps X that had been pulled back from Sicily. The Russians know of the importance of this battle as well and both the army and the air force have been strengthened severely. The Luftwaffe will have to do its utmost to support the drive of the 6th Army in this very important battle. >
<StalingradHDeDb> <The 6th Army has taken the major part of Stalingrad and has crossed the Volga at several points. Luftflotte 4 has been instrumental in this struggle. The VVS has been up in strength as never before on the southern front, with new types and much more aggressive than ever. Nevertheless, the fighters of the Luftwaffe have gained control in the air and inflicted heavy losses at a relatively light cost. Troubling us is the weather situation, which is becoming increasingly worse in the last days. If this continues, we will not be able to fly in a few days and our troops will not be able to advance further without air cover.>

<Stalingrad2DeBr> <We have a serious situation at the Stalingrad front. The Russians have used to past November days of bad weather to launch a pincer operation at the flanks of the 6th army covered by Rumanian units. Both the northern and southern attacks have been completely devastating, totally scattering our front and throwing our entire rear area into total chaos. As you know well, several field bases of the Luftwaffe were overrun in the last days. The Soviets have trapped almost the entire 6th Army in a pocket around Stalingrad. The Staff of Luftflotte 4 and Panzergruppe Hoth are desperately trying to form a holding front made up mostly of scratch units formed from rear echelons and Luftwaffe ground personnel. At the same time, High command has ordered the Luftwaffe to resupply the 6th army, which is to remain at Stalingrad in order to bind Soviet forces. Oberst Dr. Khl, the Commodore of KG55, has been tasked with the coordination of the air effort to help Stalingrad. But with bad weather, a rear area in total confusion, our main airbases  under constant threat of being overrun, a precarious supply situation and the Soviet air force stronger than ever this task will be extremely difficult.>
<Stalingrad2DeDb> <It is over. On the 2nd February, the 6th Army capitulated. 200.000 German soldiers have been killed or captured. The Luftwaffe has given all it had, but it wasn't enough. The airlift alone cost 488 planes, an entire Fliegerkorps! But without Luftflotte 4, the situation would have been much worse. The Luftwaffe attacked advancing troops, protected the airfields in the pocket and often had to defend its own airfields. Heeresgruppe Sd will have to pull back to the Don front, except for the Kuban bridgehead, which will most likely have to be evacuated as well. For the first time in this war, we have suffered a total defeat. An uncertain future lies ahead of all of us.>
<Stalingrad2RuBr> <Operation Uranus, the Pincer movement against Kalach, was a huge success. The German 6th Army is now trapped in Stalingrad. For unknown reasons, the Germans have not yet attempted to break out of the pocket. We now have a unique opportunity at hand: To destroy an entire German field army and blunt the German war effort for the entire East front! As they did at Demyansk and Kholm in the northern sector, the Germans will most likely try to supply the 6th army from the air. The VVS will try to interdict the supply effort both by attacking airbases and shooting down transports in the air.>
<Stalingrad2RuDb> <In 2nd February 1943, the German 6th Army under command of Generaloberst Paulus capitulated. Over 200.000 half starved German and Rumanian soldiers have been taken prisoner. The terrible conditions in Stalingrad bear witness to how effective the efforts of the VVS against the air supply operations have been. This has been our greatest victory yet. Even more, the whole German front has been pushed back until almost the starting point of last year's German summer offensive. The German front is that weak that it might be possible to break through at Kharkov and liberate the entire Ukraine!>

<IStalingradRuBr> <The Germans are advancing on Stalingrad! Stavka has transferred every air unit at hand to the Volga front. The City must not fall, because that would sever the connection between the Caucasus and the rest of the USSR, stopping our indigenous oil supply and leaving us at the mercy of oil from the western allies. To prevent that, strong forces have been allocated to this sector. The VVS, equipped with new types and with the experience gained in the struggles of over a year, will try to claim air superiority. Stalingrad must not fall!>
<IStalingradRuDb> <At the beginning of October, the German advance has been almost stopped. While the Germans control a major part of Stalingrad, every inch is costing them dearly and our forces are becoming stronger day by day. Soon we will launch a counteroffensive and drive them back!>

<Rzhev42DeBr> <The summer of 1942 had seen no greater front movements in the central sector of the East front. The units of Heeresgruppe Mitte were able to establish a fairly stable defensive position. But a Soviet bulge existed in the front, with the western and southernmost point being Rzhev. It was clear that the Soviets would use this position to lash out southward. The units of Luftflotte 2 had been severely weakened during the last months, major units were transferred both to Luftflotte 4 and the Mediterranean front. While the fighters have received the new Fw 190 fighter, the Soviets have introduced new planes that match the performance of our fighters. They are also becoming more and more aggressive and better in tactics. On November 18th, the Soviets opened their winter offensive from Rzhew and Velikye Lukiy. Luftflotte 2 in this area only had the two Gruppen of JG 51 Mlders, the KG 4 and several staffeln of Stukas, as well as a new Hs 129 squadron, forming Gefechtsverband Schmidt. Gefechtsverband Schmidt is tasked with close support against the advancing Soviets as well as air defence.>
<Rzhev42DeDb> <The Soviets succeeded in throwing back Heeresgruppe Mitte further, but the main goal, trapping large forces of it in a huge pocket west of Vyasma has not been accomplished. The Wehrmacht managed to withdraw from the Vyasma bulge during the Bffel movement without great losses. In a movement war, losing territory is preferrable to losing troops. The scratch formation, Gefechtsverband Schmidt, was instrumental in this move, it kept constant pressure on the Soviets. The new Fw 190s have proven themselves to be very suited for East front conditions. After the setbacks of the winter, our forces are still intact and we will turn the tide this summer!>
<Rzhev42RuBr> <After the difficult winter battles of early 1942, the central front before Moscow remained quiet during summer. The Germans threw all their forces in the advance in the south, while we were gathering strength. The frontline gave us the opportunity to try a pincer operation southward from the bulge at Rzhew in an attempt to isolate most of the German forces on the Moscow front, much the same like our comrades in the south did at Stalingrad. The German Luftwaffe in this area has fielded a new fighter, the Focke-Wulf 190. We still have not much experience against this type, but I am sure our new planes and tactics are up to this challenge. There are also reports of Spanish pilots flying with the Luftwaffe's Mlders squadron in this sector. In order for our offensive to succeed, the VVS must wrestle air superiority from the Germans and enable our troops to operate without a threat from German bombers.>
<Rzhev42RuDb> <Our offensive from Rzhew was a success, the Red Army was able to liberate another large area of the Russian SSR from German occupation. However, the advance was slower than expected, this enabled a large number of German troops to escape encirclement. While the strategic goal was not fully met, the operation was still a success. The VVS has once again proven itself. Our fighters managed to master air combat against the new German fighters, while our ground attackers were more efficient than ever in supporting our troops. The next large operation will most likely take place in summer.>

<Belgorod42DeBr> <We have defeated the Soviet winter offensive and are well placed to attack the weak forces remaining in front of us.  The first objective is Voronezh, but that is only to protect the flank of a drive towards the Soviet oil reserves in the Caucasus.  Our Hungarian and Italian allies are to supply additional forces, as much of the Wehrmacht remains to defend the salient in front of Moscow.  The enemy are exhausted and the battle should begin with another round up of their troops.>
<Belgorod42DeDb> <Though our initial attacks were successful, the penetration was too shallow because of the focus on the south, and the enemy failed to commit further troops, so our bag of prisoners was less than previous ones.  Still, Voronezh was captured easily, and held against a brief counter-attack.  The panzers that defended the city have moved to the south, leaving only the less-equipped forces of our allies to defend the west bank of the Don.>
<Belgorod42RuBr> <The winter offensive was less successful in the south than around Moscow, which got most of the reinforcements and newer equipment.  Our front is not strong enough to withstand the panzers and forces are being gathered to the rear rather than deployed in support of us.  However, every day we delay the German advance allows our factories to produce more planes, tanks and guns with which to smash the invasion.>
<Belgorod42RuDb> <Our front has collapsed, and we have lost the city of Voronezh.  While the crisis is not on the same scale as last year, unless more armies are sent to the south a vast amount of the southern Soviet Union will fall under Nazi control.  The cities of Stalino and Stalingrad owe their names to our leader's successful offensive against the Whites in this region.  We must hope that the same traps work again.>

<Sychevka42DeBr> <Despite the losses of the severe winter of 1941 the Wehrmacht have managed to establish a stable defensive position in the Rzhev salient threatening Moscow.

<Orel43HDeDb> <The Wehrmacht managed to withdraw from the Vyasma bulge during the Bffel movement without great losses. In a movement war, losing territory is preferrable to losing troops. Our new salient around Orel is still vulnerable, as it is not as well fortified as the positions prepared for the withdrawal from Rzhev.  However, after the setbacks of the winter, our forces are still intact and we will turn the tide this summer!>
<Orel43RuBr> <We have recaptured the city of Kursk, but our offensive is suffering from a lack of supplies and fresh troops.  However, the German armies are in similar difficulties and if we continue we may be able to encircle not only their Orel forces but also the armies in the salient west of Moscow. Partisan units have cut the supply lines to Orel and the road to Bryansk is only defended by small numbers of Hungarian troops.>
<Orel43RuDb> <Our armies almost recaptured Bryansk, but the German withdrawal from Rzhev meant that large numbers of reinforcements were available to them, and our successes could not be sustained.  With the retreat from Kharkov more divisions were needed in the south and we were unable to accomplish the more limited objective of surrounding Orel.  The rains have given us time to build up our forces.  The next large operation to recapture Orel will most likely take place in summer.>

<Myskhako43DeBr> <General von Manstein managed to blunt the Soviet advance at Kharkov with a series of bold manoeuvre battles, stabilizing the front.  We are still holding bridgeheads over the Kuban River, since the Reich must have oil and the army will be required to resume the offensive in summer.  After the attempt to isolate Heeresgruppe Sd failed, the Red Army began a frontal attack to drive us from the Kuban and have landed forces at Myskhako to outflank the southern part of our defences at Novorossiysk.  For that reason, the major part of Luftflotte 4, including the whole of Jagdgeschwader 52, have been sent to airfields in the Kuban and Eastern Crimea. They will support the counter-offensive against the Soviet beachhead. Since the flying weather is good, we are confident that we will be able to achieve air supremacy, and it is planned to use large numbers of Stuka dive-bombers to support the assault. It is however known that the Soviet air force has moved very strong units there, equipped with planes delivered from the Americans and British.> 
<Myskhako43DeDb> <The Soviets have failed to take Novorossiysk or break through our central defences, though they managed to retain their beachhead. The extremely tough air battles that were fought over the Kuban seem to have prevented either side from achieving their objectives. The Soviet air force, especially the fighters, was very well organized, numerically superior and very aggressive. The aces of JG 3 and 52 were able to achieve a local superiority, but the Stukas were not able to operate unhindered and the Soviet flak was intense.  If we are unable to inflict greater losses on the enemy, the air war over the East front will become more and more unfavourable.>

<Myskhako43RuBr> <Though the operations mounted by the Don front were successful, the objective of trapping German forces in the Crimea was not achieved.  Also, the Germans still have extensive defences covering Taman and bridgeheads over the Kuban River. The Red Army and Navy have established a beachhead at Myskhako to threaten the German lines from the south, and this will be combined with a new offensive in the centre. A fast operation is necessary, as we want to eliminate the Germans before they can be evacuated to the Crimea. Intelligence has been presented that the Germans will move strong air forces into the area in order to support their troops in an offensive against our positions. The battle will be a good opportunity to test the renewed tactics, pilots and planes of the VVS.> 
<Myskhako43RuDb> <For the very first time, the VVS met a strong Luftwaffe concentration head on and performed extremely well. Our new tactics have proven to be very effective at denying the Germans the ability to strike our troops, though we have yet to achieve enough superiority to be able to mount offensive missions against defended targets.  Also, the fascists were unable to wear our squadrons down and remained outnumbered at the end of the fighting.  If the German summer offensive is mounted in this sector we will be prepared for it, despite the failure to crush the bridgeheads over the Kuban river.  However, intelligence reports suggest that the next battle will centre on the salient around Kursk.>

<Kuban43DeBr> <Things are beginning to look a little brighter again in the southern area: General von Manstein managed to blunt the Soviet advance at Kharkov with a series of bold manoeuvre battles, stabilizing the front. This ended the possibility of a "Super-Stalingrad" in the entire Crimea, Kuban and southern Ukraine. While the front is relatively stable in the Ukraine, Stalin apparently decided to try smaller bites first. Forces of Heeresgruppe Sd are still holding a chunk of the Soviet Kuban coast from Taman to Novorossisk. Intelligence indicates the Red Army will launch its next offensive exactly there. For that reason, the major part of Luftflotte 4, including the whole Jagdgeschwader 52, have been sent to airfields in the Kuban and Eastern Crimea.

<Kuban43DeDb> <The Soviets have failed to crush the Kuban bridgehead, but it was a close call.

<Kuban43RuBr> <Even after our successful operation in the Don front area, the Germans still hold the Crimea and a bridgehead at the Kuban coast.

<KurskDeBr> <After difficult defensive winter battles in the Ukraine, the frontlines have stabilized themselves again in April 1943. A significant Soviet bulge had developed at Kursk, followed by a German Bulge, the Orelbogen, north of it. At the time, the German high command had decided to crush this bulge in a pincer operation from north and south. The most modern equipment, including new heavy tanks will be brought up to support the offensive. The operation has allready been delayed twice and Soviet forces in the bulge are very strong and fortified. Luftflotte 4 will support the northern Thrust from Orel. Main tasks will include winning air supremacy, close support and raids against the Soviet supply system.>
<KurskDeDb> <Our offensive at Kursk met extremely heavy resistance. The advance bogged down after only a few kilometers due to heavy fortifications and strong counterattacks. The Soviets have had terrible losses but continue to throw more and more tanks at our poor soldiers. Luftflotte 4 gave an excellent performance against a very strong Soviet air force.  And even more important, our Stukas and Schlachtflieger managed to locate and destroy a Soviet brigade trying to envelop our northern thrust. The efforts of our Pilots alone turned a total defeat into a bloody draw. But the Orelbogen cannot be hold anymore, we will have to abandon it. For the first time, a major German summer offensive has failed.>

The operation went along as planned with remarkably low losses, due to the heroic efforts of our Luftwaffe. The fighters of JG 52 have retained air supremacy and the Stukas managed to sink three Soviet destroyers and dealt a crippling blow to the Black Sea fleet.>
<Kubanlate43RuBr> <After the German offensive at Kursk has failed, the red army has launched a liberating offensive in the entire Ukraine! The German forces are fleeing to the Dniepr river line. Now it is time to eradicate the last german stronghold on the Caucasus, the Kuban bridgehead. The german 17th Army there could, if successfully evacuated, strengthen the german defense in the Crimea or the Ukraine. According to intelligence, the germans will this time not attempt to hold the bridgehead, but will evacuate. Thus, the main task of the VVS will be to interdict the evacuation of men and material across the straits of Kerch. The black Sea fleet will use all its remaining ships to support that operation. The german air units are still weakened from Kursk, while our equipment, training and moral are better than ever!>
<Kubanlate43RuDb> <The Red Banner is flying again over Taman! On the 9th October, the last German has left the Caucasus. Parts of the 17th Army managed to escape, though mostly without material. Also, they are now trapped on the Crimea. The VVS managed to sink a lot of transports, though the Black Sea fleet did not perform as expected and suffered heavy losses. The liberation of the Crimea is next!>

<Kutusov43DeBr> <The armoured reserves which were built up after Stalingrad have been squandered in the Kursk fighting and we are unable to restore our lines by rapid counterattack, as in the past.  If the Soviets are able to break our front between Vitebsk and Mogilev we will be forced to retreat once more.  It will be difficult for them to advance over territory that we have put to the fire, however, and our air forces should be able to take advantage by attacking their slow-moving columns.>
<Kutusov43DeDb> <Despite a severe lack of panzers, our infantry and artillery have managed to fight the Soviets to a standstill in this sector and their offensive has ended.  The Luftwaffe contributed by hindering the movement of Soviet armies to the front, though the escalating Allied air offensive over the Reich means that increasing numbers of our fighters and pilots are now being withdrawn to the west.>
<Kutusov43RuBr> <Our armies recaptured Smolensk in late September.  The buildings were set alight by the fascists before they withdrew and most of the old city has been destroyed.  Their armies are to be pursued and prevented from retreating into the fortifications they have established between Vitebsk and Mogilev.  If we defeat them here they have no natural line of defence remaining to them before the Soviet border.  Our task will then be to harass the enemy as they flee.>
<Kutusov43RuDb> <The weather prevented us from making a successful assault on the fascist strongpoints, though we were able to outflank Vitebsk from the north, taking Gorodok in November after a series of damp battles.  The offensive which began after the Kursk fighting has now run its course, and we are going to build up our forces for another onslaught next summer.>

<Crimea44DeBr> <In Winter 1943, the Soviets managed to gain a foothold on the Crimea. They hold Kerch and a small bridgehead, but do not have attempted any offensives so far. However, during the general retreat after the failed Kursk offensive, the land connection of the Crimea, the Perekop Isthmus, was occupied by the Soviets. It is obvious that the Soviets will try to conquer all of Crimea this spring. Our forces in the area are scarce. Most of Luftflotte 6 has been withdrawn to Rumania to counter American air raids on Rumanian oil fields. Only II./JG52, parts of SG2 and KG 100 remain in the Crimea to cover the evacuation from Sevastopol. We will have to fight great odds to cover the evacuation fleet.>
<Crimea44DeDb> <The Soviets, attacking with great numbers from both the Perekop and Kerch managed to take all of Crimea except a small pocket around Sevastopol, which managed to hold out a little longer. The German and Rumanian air and naval transports managed to evacuate around 200.000 soldiers from the Crimea, but a lot of ships were sunk. Also, around 100.000 soldiers were left on the Crimea and captured. The small Luftwaffe units fought bravely and destroyed over 600 Soviet planes, but had to leave most of their ground personnel on Crimea. At least we managed to save a lot of soldiers.>
<Crimea44RuBr> <After our winter offensives in 1943, almost all of Ukraine have been liberated and our forces are advancing into Rumania. The Crimea remains occupied by German forces, though we have established a beachhead on Kerch. We will finally take the Crimea in May. German and Rumanian forces are still present on the Island, but an evacuation operation has been launched, both via sea and air routes.

<Ukraine44HDeBr> <After the disaster around Smolensk and Vitebsk, the remains of Heeresgruppe Mitte are on constant retreat. A holding line has been set up around Lemberg in the southern part of the Soviet advance, but it will not hold very long. We expect the Soviet advance to turn south there and cross the Karpathian Mountains into Hungary. This move would cut off Germany from the oil fields in Rumania and Hungary. Heeresgruppe Sd will support the Royal Hungarian army in the defence of the Hungarian border. Luftflotte 6, supported by units of the RLV, will give air cover alongside the Hungarian air force.>
<Ukraine44HDeDb> <Lemberg fell after a short time, and the Soviets managed to cross the Carpathians into Hungary. At least we were able to prevent the Hungarians from changing sides. While the Luftwaffe and the Hungarian air force fought well, they were simply overwhelmed by the Soviets.>
<Ukraine44HRuBr> <After crushing the enemy front in Belarus, our forces are moving westward very quickly. The next target of the Red Army's advance is Lvov. From this city, several armies will turn south and try to force their way over the Carpathian Mountains into Hungary, Debrecen being the first target. The taking of large parts of Hungary will sever the German access to the oil fields of Rumania and Hungary. For that reason, heavy resistance from both Hungarian and German forces can be expected.>
<Ukraine44HRuDb> <The Red Army successfully took Lvov, but fierce resistance meant that this  was the only sector where progress was slow during the latter part of 1944.  Close quarter fighting at Krosno prevented the Soviet armies from relieving 'Free Slovakia', which could not be rescued.

<Kurland44DeBr> <The Soviet offensive endangers the borders of the Fatherland.  If we can hold them at Riga, they will be unable to continue their advance because of the threat to their flanks.  It is also easier to supply our armies from the coastal ports than by road.  Poor weather is making air operations difficult, but the use of the FW190 as a fighter-bomber allows us to continue to support our ground forces despite being greatly outnumbered.>
<Kurland44DeDb> <The reorganisation of the Soviet armies was only possible with intense use of the roads- the Luftwaffe failed to detect these movements, let alone prevent them.  Army Group North has avoided surrender, and continues to hold the approaches to Libau, while the stubborn defence of Memel allows us to continue to threaten the flanks of the main Soviet forces.  However, our planes and panzers have too little fuel for counterattacks.>

<BerlinDeBr> <The Russian offensive of Summer 44 had pushed us back almost to the 1937 borders of Germany. In February 1945, the Soviets attacked East Prussia. The Kriegsmarine launched an all out effort to save as many soldiers and civilians as possible, and the fighting over a small bridgehead near Pillau is still ongoing, as well as on Hela. The Soviets will soon launch their final offensive on Berlin. After the Ardennes offensive and the failed Operation Bodenplatte, most RLV fighter units have been assigned to the East front, leaving the defence against the US air raids to the Jet fighters of JG 7. Luftflotte 6 has an impressive order of battle, more units ever since Operation Barbarossa. But most units are understrenght, short on fuel and have only novice pilots.

<BerlinDeDb> <In late February, the Soviets crossed the Oder. An intense air campaign during which every possible weapon was used against the bridges began.

<BalatonDeBr> <Soviet forces surrounded Budapest in February and took it after brutal house fighting. Now, in March, the frontline is just along the southeastern shore of the Plattensee. 1st SS Panzerkorps has been brought up to the front and will launch an offensive aimed at liberating Budapest.

<BalatonDeDb> <Operation Frhlingserwachen didn't get far. Due to mud and rain, the offensive bogged down after a few kilometres and the SS units had to withdraw in order not to get enveloped. A few days later, the Soviets launched their own offensive. Our forces were unable to stop them and by mid April the Soviets crossed the Austrian border and took Vien. Luftflotte 4 and our Hungarian brothers in arms fought bravely, shooting down a large number of Soviet planes. But Soviet and American superiority in numbers was too large to let us make a difference. A few days after Wien, Berlin fell as well. The war is over, and all Luftwaffe units are ordered to fly westward and surrender themselves to the Americans. At least most of us will have a country to return to, unlike our Hungarian comrades.

I expect all of you to give your utmost in this desperate battle.>
<BalatonHuDb> <The offensive of the SS has failed after a few days and the Soviets have pushed the Germans back to the Austrian border. Sopron was the last Hungarian city to fall into their hands. Our country is again in the hands of the Bolsheviks and the Red terror of 1919 will return. At least we have shown the world how royal Hungarian soldiers fight and have done our duty.

<Finland41FiBr> <After the Soviets have bombed Helsinki on 25th June, Marshal Mannerheim decided to join the war on the German side in order to regain the East Karelian territories the soviets had grabbed after the winter war of 1939. The army will soon launch an offensive to liberate our territories in East Karelia. The task of the ILV will be not only the protection of Helsinki from the air, but also cover for our troops.>
<Finland41FiDb> <The Germans so far have failed to take Leningrad, but have put the city under a devastating siege and heavy air attacks. We have accomplished all goals of our war, but while 200.000 reservists are demobilized, a state of war still exists with the Soviet union, even if actual combat is limited to air combat and static warfare in front of Leningrad. We will hold the front and wait how the general situation of the German-Russian war develops before entering peace negotiations on our terms with the Soviets.>

<Leningrad41DeBr> <After difficult battles in the Baltic states and around the Ilmensee, Heeresgruppe Nord is advancing towards Tallinn and finally Leningrad. With our Finnish allies closing in on the Karelian front, Leningrad is to be totally cut off from the rest of the Soviet Union. Luftflotte 1, under command of Generaloberst Keller, is tasked with air operations over the Gulf of Finland and its military strongholds. The fighters are to win air supremacy while Stukas and Bombers will systematically attack the defensive emplacements, as well as interdict the supply shipping. Another primary target is the Red Banner Baltic fleet, which is based at Kronstadt. Luftflotte 1 will attack and destroy these ships in order to prevent their breakout to neutral Sweden.>
<Leningrad41RuBr> <A few days ago, the German forces have attacked the Soviet Union! So far, the Germans are advancing into the Lithuanian SSR and it is very likely that the final goal of the northern thrust is Leningrad, but the situation is even worse: The rulers of Finland are known to seek a revision of the 1940 peace treaty. A Finnish attack is very likely and preparations have to be made for a two front war at the Leningrad front. Leningrad PVO, Baltic fleet VVS and the northern front VVS will have to defend Leningrad and the front, while the DBA will execute pre-emptive strikes against Finnish military and political targets.>

<Leningrad41DeDb> <Our air war against Leningrad has not been totally successful. While our fighters, skillfully led by Major Trautloft, are ruling the skies, strong Soviet flak as made bombing raids on Leningrad very difficult. Especially the attacks on the Baltic fleet didn't have the expected success. Though some ships were sunk, the bulk of the fleet is still operational and remains a threat. Our ground troops also so far have failed to make more gains against the defensive emplacements and trench warfare reminiscent of the last war has developed in front of Leningrad. Isolating the city will also get more and more difficult in the winter when the Soviets will be able to supply the city via the frozen Ladogasee.>
<Leningrad41RuDb> <The Germans have failed to take Leningrad, but we are under siege and a terrible famine has broken out in the city. We must hope the supply situation gets better when Lake Ladoga is frozen and usable for truck traffic. The VVS and PVO regiments have fought heroically in the skies over Leningrad, preventing larger German terror raids and protecting the Red Banner Baltic fleet from being annihilated from the air. While doing so, they air regiments have taken heavily losses. For the upcoming counteroffensives, the VVS and PVO of Leningrad will have to be rebuild.>

<Leningrad42DeBr> <After the difficult battles at Demyansk and Volkhov, the siege ring around Leningrad has been closed again. The only supply route for the city is the Ladogasee. During winter, the Soviets are sending truck convoys over the ice and during summer, ships delivering supplies. Luftflotte 1 has the grim mission of keeping the pressure on Leningrad, both by maintaining air supremacy and striking at Soviet industry and supplies.>
<Leningrad42RuBr> <The efforts by the Red Army to re-establish the land connection to Leningrad have failed. The city still is in a difficult position, even though the supplies brought in via Lake Ladoga are now barely sufficient to sustain the civilians and soldiers in Leningrad. The main task of the VVS will for the next time will be to keep the city alive. For this, we have to protect our supply routes from air attacks, strike at the German positions and protect the city itself.>
<Leningrad42FiBr> <While we have re-established the pre 1940 borders and have demobilized many reservists, a state of war continues to exist between the Soviets and us. For that reason, we must keep the pressure on them to prevent Soviet offensives. The Finnish air force's task is to maintain air supremacy north of Leningrad and on the Karelian front.>

<Leningrad42DeDb> <Leningrad is still under siege. We have fortified our emplacements, but it is well possible that the Russians will attempt another breakout operation this winter. The baltic fleet has been struck again, but is still operational. The fighters of JG 54 are still ruling the skies, but Soviet air strength is increasing. The soviet air force in Leningrad is especially strenghthened by planes from the US or England.>
<Leningrad42RuDb> <The Germans have so far failed to make any gains against Leningrad. The Germans have also failed in sinking any more ships of the Baltic fleet. Enemy landing operations on the islands in Lake Ladoga have been repulsed. The route over the lake is secure for now. In next winter, the red army is ready for another attempt to open a land route to Leningrad.>
<Leningrad42FiDb> <The Germans have failed to take Leningrad so far, and the siege is holding. The conditions in the city must be terrible. Yet the siege of Leningrad is instrumental in keeping the soviets from attacking Finland again. We must keep the pressure on the Soviets.>

<Leningrad43DeBr> <During the last days, the soviets have started to attack the positions of our 18th army at the Southern shore of the Ladogasee, near Schlsselburg. The attack is aimed at opening a land corridor to the city. We will not be able to keep the siege if the Soviets can resupply by land. Luftflotte 1 must undertake a maximum effort to support our ground forces. >
<Leningrad43RuBr> <Operation Iskra, the relief offensive for Leningrad, is about to begin! The VVS on the Karelian and Leningrad front will support 2nd Shock army and 67th army in their move against the German salient near Shlisselburg. The enemy air forces are weaker than in the previous year, as the Germans have withdrawn some forces westward and the Finnish have assumed a defensive posture.>
<Leningrad43FiBr> <The Soviets are preparing for another offensive to relieve Leningrad. Their forces are ready to strike a German position south of Ladoga. The siege of Leningrad will be very difficult to maintain when the Russians can open a land corridor. We must support the Germans in the defense of the Schlsselburg salient. >

<Leningrad43DeDb> <After almost two years, the pressure from Soviet units inside Leningrad is growing, Luftflotte 1 is more and more forced to a defensive stance. While the air units have performed brilliantly, the Luftflotte has been forced to give a lot of units to other theaters and fronts. For that reason, our strength has decreased while the enemy is stronger than ever. We enter the third year with an uncertain future ahead...>
<Leningrad43RuDb> <Leningrad has been through two terrible years, but the worst is over now. The Red Army and VVS defending the city are stronger than ever and everything is ready for breaking out of the siege. The VVS was instrumental in keeping Leningrad alive for two years. It fought the best German pilots, it protected the supply routes and now has turned offensive against German airfields and positions.>
<Leningrad43FiDb> <During the last two years, the ILV has fought very well, but Soviet air strength has increased severely. Even with the new 109s from Germany, we are simply outnumbered by the Soviets. It is very likely that the Soviets will attempt to break out of the siege of Leningrad soon. And after that, it is only a matter of time until they attack Finland again.>

<Leningrad44DeBr> <This morning, the Baltic fleet has commenced a heavy bombardment of our forward positions at Oranienbaum! The Soviets are breaking out of Leningrad! Luftflotte 1 must support the ground forces on their retreat and help the establishment of a new defensive line near Narva. The VVS is stronger than ever, but we still have qualitative superiority.>
<Leningrad44RuBr> <This morning, our comrades of the Baltic fleet have started to bombard the German siege positions! The time is there to end the siege of Leningrad! The VVS will support the offensive. Our main task will be to  destroy the Luftwaffe's bases and cover the advance of our troops. If this offensive succeeds, the entire Baltic and Finland may soon be liberated as well!>
<Leningrad44FiBr> <The Soviets have broken out of the Siege of Leningrad in January and have reconquered most of the Baltic states. Reconnaissance has revealed a huge Soviet build-up at our borders. It is only a matter of time until the Soviets will attack us and this time we might not be able to stop them. The ILV must defend our cities and protect our ground forces.>

<Leningrad44RuDb> <Leningrad is free again! We have broken the siege and the Red Army is rapidly advancing in the Baltic republics. Narva has fallen and Tallinn will fall soon. The German forces are regrouping in the south and are forming a pocket, which we will have to eliminate in the next time. Also, our offensive in Karelia has been a huge success, we have re-established the 1940 border and the Finns have signed an honorable peace with us. Two bitter years of hunger and suffering are over for the people of Leningrad!>
<Leningrad44DeDb> <The siege positions around Leningrad, shell-shocked by the massive bombardment, have been totally overrun. The new defensive line at Narva did not hold very long and it is only a matter of time until the Soviets take Tallinn. Luftflotte 1 will withdraw to Kurland to cover our forces there.>
<Leningrad44FiDb> <In June, the Soviet offensive finally struck. Two Soviet armies, with over 200.000 men and thousands of tanks, supported by a huge air fleet, have attacked us. The ILV and the Germans have fought bravely, shooting down 800 planes, but were not able to keep air supremacy. With massive German help, we were able to stop the Soviet offensive just on the 1940 border, but we cannot maintain this line for long. We have to negotiate for peace or the very existence of our country will be at stake.>

<Finland40FiBr> <February, 1940.After our recent victories, it's time for reinforcements. We have deployed our new fighter planes. Our aging Bristol Bulldog are needing a break, and the Fokkers are very busy! It's time to win a war!>
<Finland40FiDb> <March, 1940.We have been defeated, but the Soviets have negotiated with our government. Our country is smaller now, but we are independent and free! Soviet have failed to invade us!. Someday We'll recover our lost territories.>
<Finland40RuBr> <February, 1940.Those fascist Finnish are harder than we expected.They managed to stop our offensive. It's time to deploy our better planes. We'll change our I-15's and I-16 Type 10 with the new I-153 and I-16-Type 18 and deploy more bombers. They'll be forced to surrender this time!> 
<Finland40RuDb> <March, 1940.We have fought well! The Finnish have surrendered. Our legitimate demands are satisfied now. URRS is bigger and more powerful than ever and a peaceful future is coming.>

<KurlandJun44DeBr> <As a consequence of the collapse of Army Group Centre following the Operation Bagration offensive that started on 22nd June 1944 the Soviets have reached the Baltic States. The developments of the last weeks of July means that there is a serious risk that Army Group North will be cut off. Luftflotte 1 is desperately trying to delay the enemy advance and relieve the pressure on our hard-pressed infantry.> 
<KurlandJun44DeDb> <A determined drive by the Soviet 2nd Baltic Front has reached the coast west of Riga and separated Army Groups North and Centre. Unless Army Group North can withdraw in good order and rejoin the rest of the German army we risk a greater catastrophe than Stalingrad.>

<KurlandAug44DeBr> <The Soviet summer offensive has bogged down - but only because their amazing success has stretched their supply  lines to breaking point. In our sector the Russians have broken through between Army Groups North and Centre and catastrophe threatens. Our 3rd Panzer Army has been ordered to attack in the Tukkum area and retake Mitau in conjunction with a withdrawal westwards by Army Group North. We need to ensure the link-up of our forces at all costs if we are not to leave hundreds of thousands of men behind.>
<KurlandAug44DeDb> <We have re-established a link to Army Group North, though we couldnt retake Mitau. Now we need to stabilise the front line - it is collapsing everywhere else. The Rumanians have just changed sides after a new Russian offensive in the south and the Americans and Canadians have trapped huge numbers of our troops in the Falaise pocket.>

<KurlandOct44DeBr> <Just as we stabilise one part of the front line, news comes of a major Soviet troop build-up stretching from Mitau as far south as Kauen. It seems we can expect another Soviet broad front offensive: they can be everywhere - we cannot. The Bauske area is particularly threatened, with one of our divisions facing two enemy corps. In addition it is vital we hold Riga - a Russian breakthrough here would give them a valuable naval base from which their torpedo boats and submarines could threaten the supply ships that keep Army Group North alive.>
<KurlandOct44DeDb> <In just five days the Soviet 1st Baltic Front broke through to the Baltic Sea coast near Polangen. There was nothing we could do. We have, however, kept the Riga corridor open and Army Group North have withdrawn in good order into the Kurland peninsula and established a defensive perimeter in accordance with Hitlers orders. Memel has been surrounded and is under terrible pressure and further south Soviet forces have set foot on German territory for the first time, unleashing tides of refugees.>

<KurlandNov44DeBr> <The last months have seen a massive loss of men, material and territory. Army Group North is restricted to a small area and is bunkered down - our mobile reserves are so limited that there can be no thought of a break-out to re-establish links with Army Group Centre, themselves under enormous pressure. As AG Centre withdraws, Army Group North has been ordered to tie down as many Soviet divisions as possible. Comparisons with the Sixth Armys position at Stalingrad are unavoidable, though our control of the Baltic Sea offers a reliable supply line that they did not have. Reports are coming in of a Soviet offensive against the southern defences of the Kurland cauldron. Things are hotting up again.>
<KurlandNov44DeDb> <The Soviet 1st and 2nd Baltic Fronts were thrown back with heavy losses to both sides. We can hope for a breathing space on the ground, perhaps, but Russian air attacks remain as intense as ever. Our fuel is beginning to run low and is limiting our ability to provide cover. Army Group North is down to half a million men with little prospect of replacing lost tanks, artillery and vehicles.>

<KurlandDec44DeBr> <The pressure on our defences is growing again - it looks like there will be another attempt to crush us before Christmas. Army Group Centre reports that the enemy are now firmly entrenched inside East Prussia while Army Group Kurland report heavy attacks on our lifelines - the ports of Libau and Windau. Now the emphasis seems to have switched to intense artillery and aerial preparation of our front lines so we can expect action today.>
<KurlandDec44DeDb> <The Soviet offensive lasted until the last day of 1944 and has cost us heavily, though our lines remained unbroken. As well as the hundreds of thousands in the Kurland pocket, our troops are also still just holding out in Memel, where the situation is grave. That JG54 scored its 9000th kill is remarkable, but seems unlikely to be enough.>

<KurlandJan45DeBr> <The great Soviet winter offensive has driven westwards - Knigsberg is isolated and  Silesia  invaded. Both the Kurland and Memel pockets are once again the subjects of intense attack. High command are pulling men out to throw into the main battle in the Reich - but we must hold on!>
<KurlandJan45DeDb> <We have held the front in Kurland but we have lost control of the airfields at Cranz north of Knigsberg  and the Red Army have taken Memel. In the Reich the Red Army stands on the Oder River just 150km from Berlin while in the west the Anglo-American forces have crossed the Rhine - things are serious.>

<KurlandFeb45DeBr> <The loss of the airbases in the Knigsberg pocket to our south mean that Luftflotte 1 must carry the entire burden of the air war here on the Baltic. This morning, 20th February 1945, we woke to the news that our lines are once more under attack but are holding, so far. Our most potent offensive forces have been withdrawn to Germany, so it will now just be a bitter defence to the end. All thoughts of breakout or counter-attack seem to have vanished.>
<KurlandFeb45DeDb> <Another battle - losses on both sides have been heavy, but the enemy can sustain them better than we can. Our situation grows worse and worse, especially where fuel is concerned. Our ability to operate and resist is becoming seriously limited. On the other hand the Russians seem if anything slightly less aggressive than before, as if they know we are stuck here and can safely be contained until Berlin falls.>

<KurlandMar45DeBr> <After a mere weeks peace the next offensive is upon us, with intense air and artillery preparation. Our defences are weak but defend we must. General Pflugbeil has released stocks of aviation fuel to ensure we can provide the cover our hard-pressed infantry need. It's time to hunt still more Sturmoviks.>
<KurlandMar45DeDb> <The Red Army has made inroads into our positions between Frauenburg and Tukkum but failed to achieve the decisive breakthrough they had been hoping for. Our lines are battered but they are holding, although in places it was only the direct fire of our artillery that held things together.>

<KurlandApr45DeBr> <The Wehrmacht has crumbled everywhere but here - our lines stand firm and we remain a thorn in the side of the Soviet advance on Berlin. Let us do what we can to relieve the pressure on our homeland. The parlous fuel situation means it will be precious little but we will fight as best we can.>
<KurlandApr45DeDb> <The Russian storm broke on Berlin less than a month ago. Hitler is dead and Admiral Dnitz has surrendered - the guns have finally fallen silent. The troops of Army Group Kurland are marching into captivity, but we pilots have been ordered to fly out to Schleswig-Holstein and safety, taking as many of our ground crew as we can cram into the fuselage. The fight is over - lets get out of here!>

<KurlandJun44RuBr> <Operation Bagration has driven the Germans back across Belarus and into Poland, opening up weaknesses where the German 16th and 18th Armies meet. Our 2nd and 3rd Baltic Fronts are driving into this gap and the 1st Baltic Front has already taken Schaulen. The aim is to thrust through Mitau and Tukkum to reach the Baltic coast west of Riga and cut off the entire German Army Group North based around Riga and Tallinn. Further south we aim to strike towards the borders of East Prussia and so set foot on Germany proper for the first time. The 15th Air Army is tasked with supporting both of these efforts.>
<KurlandJun44RuDb> <Our advance in the north has been hugely successful and our forces have reached the coast, although not in strength. We can expect a German counter-attack imminently and our Sturmoviks and bombers will have to make up for a lack of tanks and prepared defences in this sector by blunting the German spearheads. In the south we have occupied large areas of Latvia and Lithuania but haven't had the breakthrough we were aiming for. Nevertheless, the encirclement of the whole of Army Group North means that the Germans in the south will have to decide between counter-attacking our forces in the north or providing a determined defence of East Prussia.>

<KurlandAug44RuBr> <We have finally expelled the hated invader from Russia after three long years! Now the frontline runs along the borders of the Reich itself as we approach East Prussia.  In the north our reconnaissance shows a massive build-up of enemy forces east and west of our corridor to the Baltic: our bombers and sturmoviks are on stand-by to attack the moment the Germans break cover. We are in a strong position, but faced by the veterans of JG54 and JG51 we must stay alert!>
<KurlandAug44RuDb> <The German counter-attack was heavier than expected and broke through our lines to re-establish contact between the enemy's Army Groups Centre and North, albeit along a tenuous strip along the coast. The Germans are clearly stronger than we thought and remain in firm control of Riga. It is time for us to pause and collect our strength after the summer's headlong rush.>

<KurlandOct44RuBr> <Our Divisions stand on the borders of the Reich and are poised for a massive onslaught on the German positions. New supplies of tanks and assault guns backed by huge stockpiles of artillery ammunition mean that our huge push is imminent. The strategy is two-fold - a direct attack on Riga and a westwards thrust towards Memel. The Memel attack is once again aimed at the juncture of the German Army Groups North and Centre and a perceived weakness in their defences.>
<KurlandOct44RuDb> <Success! The 1st Baltic Front reached the coast north of Memel in a few days, followed by the 3rd Belorussian Front reaching the coast south of Memel 48 hours later. A massive rift has opened in German lines and our tank and assault divisions are pouring in. Defences are being thrown up on each side of the corridor to hinder German counter-attacks and Memel is besieged. Our attack on Riga was less successful - the city was finally taken but only after the Germans had successfully withdrawn westwards. Still, the German Army Group North is now trapped on the Kurland peninsula with hundreds of thousands of men relying on air and sea supply.>

<KurlandNov44RuBr> <The Red Army is once more on the attack - into East Prussia in the south and towards the vital German-held port of Libau in the north. The Air Force has been tasked with attacks on enemy ports and shipping in the enemy's rear and the destruction of enemy tanks, self-propelled guns and "88's at the front. Our fighter regiments have been ordered to shape up - losses of IL-2's and Pe-2's in particular have been too high. A number of elite La-5FN, La-7 and Yak-3 Regiments have been sent to our front to conduct free hunts and fighter sweeps and  take on the German fighter units.>
<KurlandNov44RuDb> <It is clear that the German pocket in the Kurland peninsula is not about to collapse. Our attacks have reached none of their goals and have met with such determined resistance on the ground and in the air that we will need to pause before deciding what to do next. In spite of the numerical superiority of our 15th Air Army, the German Luftflotte 1 is scoring disproportionately highly.>

<KurlandDec44RuBr> <Stalin has ordered the destruction of the German forces in the Kurland pocket by the end of the year so that the forces of the Baltic Fronts can be diverted southwards to the fight for Poland and the push for Berlin. That leaves us 10 days to take Libau and Windau and thereby cut the German lifelines across the sea.>
<KurlandDec44RuDb> <Our attacks have rarely penetrated more than a few hundred metres and at terrible cost. We have reached the end of 1944 no closer to the destruction of the Kurland Pocket than we were at the end of October. Our aircraft losses have been terrible, particularly around Libau, and for very little effect on the enemy's supply operations. Even besieged Memel is holding out under terrific bombardment and in the south we have not made to progress we anticipated.>

<KurlandJan45RuBr> <The Germans appear to have gone over to a purely defensive stance, having withdrawn most of their armour for a counter-offensive on their western front and in the hope of reducing the fuel and supply problems. It seems they are not anticipating an attack in the cold and wet January weather.>
<KurlandJan45RuDb> <We have lost over 200 aircraft for very little progress on the ground. Stalin is furious and Goebells overjoyed. We have been given a week to resupply then we attack again. This cannot be allowed to continue! The only good news comes from the south of our sector, where Memel has finally fallen and our forces stand at the gates of Koenigsberg.>

<KurlandFeb45RuBr> <Thanks to the rapid advance of our forces through Poland, the Red Army stands at the gates of Germany itself. The remaining enemy forces in East Prussia have been bottled up around Koenigsberg, Memel has fallen and the time has come to renew our pressure on Kurland. Our Airforce  is once again called on to go all out, especially as many of our best ground units have already been diverted westwards for the final push on Berlin. Still, it seems that the Germans are running low on fuel and air opposition may be diminishing, although the flak is as intensive as ever. That will be a major problem around Libau, especially for the Bostons of the Baltic Fleet Airforce that have been tasked with shutting the port down.>
<KurlandFeb45RuDb> <The German defence is just as tenacious as ever and in spite of some successes it is proving impossible to drive the enemy back. The enemy 190's are proving as deadly as ever in spite of the numbers we knock down.>

<KurlandMar45RuBr> <We are facing exhausted troops with little in the way of fuel and ammunition. The quality of their pilots is dropping as their experts are shot down one by one. Stalin wants the Kurland pocket eliminated by the time Berlin falls - there is not to be a "last stand" anywhere in the east. A vast array of B-25's, Bostons, IL-4's, Pe-2's and Sturmoviks has been gathered to pummel the defenders into submission.>
<KurlandMar45RuDb> <Our High Command have called a halt to this senseless battle of attrition. With all eyes on our forces preparing for the onslaught on Berlin it has been decided to concentrate on strangling the Kurland supply lines with naval aircraft, submarines and torpedo boats. We have already lost too many men for too little reward.>

<KurlandApr45RuBr> <The end is fast approaching. The final push into the enemy capital is about to begin. Our task is to pressure the Kurland pocket and prevent the enemy using ships and aircraft to transfer his troops westwards. We will do this not only by attacks on his supply lines but also by increasing pressure at the front and making it impossible for him to withdraw units.>
<KurlandApr45RuDb> <Victory! Hitler is dead, Germany is conquered! In Latvia alone over 250,000 men have laid down their arms and surrendered, in spite of a huge effort by the German Navy to take off as many men as they could. The war is over - let us rejoice!>

<Murmansk4ARuBr> <The Germans have been massing around Kirkenes in northern Norway and on the 22nd June they crossed the border into northern Finland,occupying the Petsamo area. This puts them within easy striking range of Murmansk. Our ice-free gateway to the northern seas and the Northern Fleet itself are at risk. Nor is Murmansk the only target - if the enemy can cut the railway to the south then Murmansk will starve. The units of the 14th Air Army and the Northern Fleet Airforce have outdated aircraft - High Command have assessed the situation and new aircraft including cannon-armed Polikapov I-16's and the latest MiG-3's and LaGG-3's will arrive in less than a month. But that gives the enemy some three weeks to cover the short distance from the Finnish border. We have two advantages: in contrast to the disasters further south in Poland and the Ukraine, effective aircraft dispersal and poor weather on the 22nd itself have meant that very few of our aircraft were lost in the initial German strikes. Secondly, our pilots are among the most experienced of all Soviet aviators. Many have fought in the Winter War and against the Japanese and are older than average. We need to hold out until we can get reinforcements from the south. In addition, there is already talk of alliance with Britain and Murmansk will be a key part of any proposed military cooperation.>
<Murmansk4ARuDb> <We have taken many casualties and had to give up vital ground, but all is not lost! Last night LaGG-3 and model 24 I-16's were flown in from Monchegorsk. The British have flown in Hurricanes from a naval unit offshore and more are being assembled near Archangelsk. It is time to avenge our fallen comrades!>

<Murmansk41RuBr> <The Germans have swept over the border from Finland but are finding it much harder going than they expected. They seem to have split their forces in two - one group headed directly for Murmansk, the other attempting to cut the railway lines further south. If either succeeds, we are lost. British convoys have started arriving, bringing much needed supplies, including modern Hurricane fighters and pilots and engineers who will help us get them into service. 2 GSAP of the Northern Fleet have received a squadron of MiG-3's and some Pe-2 bombers while the 14th Air Army have got LaGG-3's. Cannon-armed I-16's have started knocking down enemy Stukas and there is a growing sense of confidence in our forces. The enemy may be hurting us but we are certainly hurting them! Our mission is to protect Murmansk and the British convoys.>
<Murmansk41RuDb> <It is now dark for 22 hours a day and the intense polar cold has grounded all flying. The British squadrons returned home at the end of November, leaving us hundreds of aircraft, with more arriving every month. Our forces have been battered and stretched beyond belief and many of our most experienced pilots have died, but still we fight one. We will see what 1942 has in store when flying resumes at the beginning of February.>

<Murmansk42RuBr> <In spite of the heroic efforts of all our comrades, the Germans remain within striking distance of Murmansk. The British have been sending us P-40 fighters that are gradually filling up our Naval airforce regiments and now that the USA is in the war it seems we have been promised plenty more. Furthermore, after the danger to Moscow receeded in January with our successful counter-attacks we have started getting PVO units to help protect Murmansk from enemy bombing. We have also converted 120 Hurricanes to carry bombs, as the famous IL-2 Sturmovik is required for the central combat zones to the south. To counter our growing strength, the Germans are switching tactics. Rather than attacking Murmansk directly they are attacking the British and US convoys with a new Gruppe of He-111 torpedo bombers, I/KG26, who have been training in Italy. Together with Ju-88 dive bombers they represent a real threat to our lifeline from the West. Meanwhile Bf-110's and Ju-88's are hitting the railway to the heartlands as quickly as we can repair it. However it seems our successes last year have at least driven the ageing Ju-87 Stuka out of the northern skies!>
<Murmansk42RuDb> <The war in the north seems to have bogged down into stalemate. The Germans cannot dislodge us from Murmansk and have contented themselves with disrupting our supply chain by attacking convoys and the railway. For our part we seem unable to mass sufficient reserves to push the Germans back out of northern Finland; the thousands of trucks, jeeps, tanks, radios and the tonnes of other supplies are mostly going to feed the bitter struggle west of Moscow. Good news though - the German Sixth Army has been surrounded in Stalingrad and news comes of a major push by our forces west of Moscow.>

<Murmansk43RuBr> <After the shock of seeing the latest German fighters like the Messerschmitt Bf-109F and the Focke-Wulf 190A3 tear through our regiments last year, it seems we are finally achieving parity in terms of equipment. Our fighter regiments have received the P-39 Airacobra and later versions of the P-40. The Yaks and Lavochkins are reaching comparable quality and the latest IL-2's with rear gunner seats and modern munitions are filling our attack regiments. The incomparable Boston is replacing the slower Hampden and IL-4 in our bomber regiments and after the success of the great Stalingrad encirclement battle it seems the Germans are now on the back foot. We must not be complacent though - the Messerschmitt model G has appeared in the North and the German flak is deadlier than ever.>
<Murmansk43RuDb> <This year has been hard. The loss of so many of our comrades for so little change on the ground is a terrible blow. But while we have held our positions here, the Germans have lost thousands of tanks at Kursk and have been driven out of the Kuban, while their front now stands hundreds of kilometres from the gates of Moscow. And it is due in no small part to our efforts here. And we have been assured that next year will see a great strategic offensive!>

<Murmansk44RuBr> <You have just returned to the North after a well-earned period of relative calm instructing at the flying school in Lipetsk. That sunshine must have been terrible - I'm sure you're glad to be back in the ice and cold. You are just in time for the big push west - the Petsamo-Kirkenes operation. Our forces have advanced into the Karelian Isthmus and knocked Finland out of the war, which together with a strategic realignment by Sweden has left German forces in the North quite isolated. British and Norwegian units flying out of Scotland are harrying German sea supply traffic and reports from German prisoners speak of low fuel and ammunition stocks. It is time to advance and seize the moment. The main danger will come from the fighter and Jabo units of Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey, a large part of which decamped into our area of operations after the Finnish ceasefire in the South. We need to prevent them hitting our army and its chain of supply as we advance.>
<Murmansk44RuDb> <Victory! For the second time in five years we have occupied northern Finland after a hard-fought campaign - and this time we are not about to hand it back. The Petsamo region and its nickel mines will remain ours. American airforce units secretly based in northern Sweden have begun ferrying Norwegian armed policemen into what remains of Kirkenes. Our troops will withdraw as soon as the Norwegians feel they have things under control. The German troops who were threatening Murmansk so recently are retreating in disorder down the spine of Norway.>

<Murmansk4ADeBr> <Gentlemen, welcome! The bad weather of the last few days is breaking up and it is time to attack. Unfortunately we have lost the element of surprise that has seen the Russian airforce devastated in the central sectors. Still, no matter - we are opposed only by older Polikarpov fighters here and a few of the so-called "fast bombers" that are no match for our Messerschmitts. Our hardy mountain troops have occupied Northern Finland with our ally's agreement and last night began crossing the Russian border. Murmansk is close!>
<Murmansk4ADeDb> <Our troops have advanced, but not as we had hoped. The Russian resistance has been fiercer than expected and the Russian fliers have committed themselves with a bravery and skill we had not anticipated. This kind of low altitude skirmishing is something new for us but we will have to adapt! More bad news: reconnaissance of Russian bases has revealed the presence of more modern fighters and bombers like the MiG-3, LaGG-3 and Pe-2. In addition a British convoy has been spotted north of Murmansk.>

<Murmansk41DeBr> <The High Command, frustrated by the slow progress of our army towards Murmansk, has cancelled the southern push to cut the Kirov Railroad and has put all our assets in the north with the aim of being in Murmansk before the weather closes in. The air war in the north is about to intensify. LaGG-3 aircraft yesterday intercepted Stukas over Ristikent and British Hurricanes have been spotted near Murmansk, presumably on orientation flights. Whether the pilots are British or Russian has yet to be determined. The time has come for an all-out effort to bomb a way clear for our attacking divisions and to prevent the Soviet airmen from stalling our advance.>
<Murmansk41DeDb> <In spite of the huge number of enemy aircraft shot down by our fighters and the devastation wrought by our Stukas and bombers, we have still not decisively routed the Soviets. The British convoys have supplied the enemy with hundreds of fighters and the presence of newer Russian types has made us wary of committing unescorted aircraft. The Stuka is to be withdrawn from the north - we have simply lost too many. We need to refit over the winter and see what 1942 will bring.>

<Murmansk42DeBr> <Last year we almost reached Murmansk but we ran out of supplies and momentum and had to withdraw a little as winter closed in. Now the weather has opened up again it is time to maintain pressure on the enemy. A special factor now is the large amount of British and US convoys making for Murmansk and Archangelsk - the Ju-88's and He-111's are finding it harder and harder to attack them and will need escorting. For the fighter pilots things look good: we have sent our old Messerschmitt Bf 109E-4s back to the Navy and we have late-model Emils and are getting the newer Bf-109F's in the fighter Gruppen and even some Fw-190A models as fast strike aircraft. The enemy has nothing that can match us!>
<Murmansk42DeDb> <As 1942 draws to a close, we have experienced neither the early rapid advances of German units further south, nor their later collapse. The front line has remained stable, success and failure measured more in terms of our interdiction of the enemy's supply chain. We have had our successes but too much is still getting through.>

<Murmansk43DeBr> <The advantages we had in 1942 are eroding fast: the new Bf109G in our fighter regiments no longer stands head and shoulders above the enemy, now that they have received large numbers of the American Airacobra. Their Yak and Lavochkin fighters are also of better quality and are available in greater numbers, while their newer IL-2's with rear gunner are harder targets. The quality of their pilots in this sector is getting better all the time. But fight we must: American ships are bringing aluminium, bombers and tanks to the enemy. The British carry fighters, jeeps and radios. If we cannot sink their ships we have to hit the railways that carry these supplies to the interior. And then there are the steadily increasing numbers of Russian troops, tanks, trucks and artillery massed against us. We will need repeated attacks to disrupt any thoughts they may have of attacking us.>
<Murmansk43DeDb> <This year has been hard. The loss of so many of our comrades for so little change on the ground is a terrible blow. And while we have held our positions here, our units have lost thousands of tanks at Kursk and have been driven out of the Kuban, while our panzers now stand hundreds of kilometres from the gates of Moscow. There seems to be little prospect of a quick reversal in our fortunes.>

<Murmansk44DeBr> <Information from Russian prisoners suggests that a major offensive is about to be lauched against us. Our aerial reconnaissance would appear to confirm this - large numbers of IL-2 Sturmoviks have been concentrated on airbases near the front. Our situation is serious - the Finnish ceasefire and the Swedish strategic realignment have left us isolated, reduced to getting supplies up the long Norwegian coast in vulnerable freighters under constant attack from British and Norwegian units flying out of Scotland. However in some ways we are stronger than last year - elements of Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey including new Fw-190F8 attack aircraft and new models of the Fw-190 and Bf-109G have joined us here in the north. Whether that is enough to make a difference is up to you!>
<Murmansk44DeDb> <The Russian onslaught was overwhelming. We seriously underestimated their resources and the concentrations of force they could employ. In light of our isolation and poor supply state it was all we could do to retreat in good order. The north belongs to the Russians.>

<MurmanskR41RuBr> <The Germans have swept over the border from Finland but are finding it much harder going than they expected. They seem to have split their forces in two - one group headed directly for Murmansk, the other attempting to cut the railway lines further south. If either succeeds, we are lost.

<MurmanskR44RuBr> <With the Finns out of the war the time has come to drive the isolated Germans out of northern Finland and Norway. You are just in time for the big push west - the Petsamo-Kirkenes operation. It is time to advance and seize the moment, but we can only do that based on a good appreciation of the enemy positions and ship movements. Your reconnaissance flight is a vital part of the operation. Good luck.>

A special factor now is the large amount of British and US convoys making for Murmansk and Archangelsk - Germany's first torpedo attack unit, I/KG26 has been sent to Kirkenes after training in Italy. We will sink the Allied shipping!>

<KBFBaltic41RuBr> <The Germans have broken through our defences around Riga, capturing the city within the first two weeks of the war. Now they hold Tallinn and they are pressing forward towards the borders of Mother Russia herself! Leningrad lies within their reach, with the Finns already closing on the city from the north. The Germans have momentarily slowed their advance, with their tanks waiting for the infantry and supplies to catch up. Now is the moment to throw what we have at them. Unfortunately our resources are low. The Germans destroyed almost our entire Army air force in the area at Libava and Kaunas. Now the air force of the Baltic Fleet is to be thrown into their path. Our Regiment has modern MiG-3's to combat their aircraft and older I-16 and I-153 fighters to strafe and bomb their positions. Pilot - uphold the glory of the Navy and the Red Banner of the Revolution.>
<KBFBaltic41RuDb> <We fought gloriously against the invader but our Regiment has few planes remaining and the Panzers are rolling again. We have been ordered to fall back towards Leningrad. You are to be sent ahead by train with the 3rd Eskadrilya to pick up new and better fighters at Oranienbaum.>

<GOF41WinterDeBr> <As of Nov 1, 1941 Army Group North and the Finnish I and IV Korps have almost completely surrounded Leningrad. Just to the east we are closing on Tikhvin which is a main rail center supporting Leningrad. We have been unable to penetrate the city's main defences, but have effectively blockaded it. When Moscow is taken, those troops will help in the final assault against the city./n/nWith the Ladogasee freezing, the Bolsheviks will try to supply the city over the frozen lake. We must take every step to keep the "Eisbahn" closed and to keep up pressure all along the northern front. Bf-109F4s of JG54 "Green Hearts", based at Siverskaya, will sweep the skies of enemy aircraft. The Ju-87's of the Stukageschwadern and our level bombers from KG1 and KG4 will annihilate the enemy on the ground and the Red Banner Baltic Fleet at their "safe" anchorage in Leningrad.>

<GOF41WinterRuBr> <As of Nov 1, 1941 The Germans and their Finnish allies have nearly surrounded Leningrad. The only routes open are over the frozen surface of Lake Ladoga. Sorties conducted by the VVS-KBF in the coming weeks will be largely in support of the Ice Road. We must keep these routes open and the supply trains safe. Our armies are reinforcing to push the Fascists out of Shlisselburg and open up the land route to Leningrad. Mobile naval units of the KBF are at anchor under heavy flak protection in the Neva River, but may also need our protection. Our Sturmovik units will continue to hit the enemy wherever he is. Millions of our Comrades in Lenin's City are counting on us!>

<GOF41WinterFiBr> <As of Nov 1, 1941 We have pushed the Russians nearly back to the gates of Leningrad itself. We must keep up the pressure if we are to ensure a future free of Soviet aggression. The extreme skill and spirits of our flyers has so far given us the edge in combat against the Russians. The B-239 and G.50 are competitive with anything on the enemy side. We will continue our tempo of air operations in support of our army and to cut off Leningrad from resupply across the frozen surface of Lake Ladoga.>

<GOF41WinterDeDb> <As of Feb 28, 1942 we have kept up our pressure on Leningrad but the city still stands, the stubborn Bolsheviks would rather starve than surrender. Moscow has not yet been taken so we will have to wait indefinitely for reinforcements from Army Group Center. We have had to retreat from Tikhvin but still hold Shlisselburg. With winter nearing an end, Ladogasee will thaw and Leningrad will become an island, and the Ladogasee will become a watery tomb for any ships or barges trying to cross.>

<GOF41WinterRuDb> <As of Feb 28, 1942 the Germans have failed to take Leningrad, but we are still under siege and a terrible famine has continued in the city. We must hope the supply situation gets better in the spring when new offensives can open more supply routes. We have driven the Germans out of Tikhvin and have closed on Lyuban but the Germans still hold Shlisselburg and with it the land-route to Leningrad is still closed. The VVS-KBF and PVO regiments have fought heroically in the skies over Leningrad, preventing larger German terror raids and protecting the Red Banner Baltic fleet from being annihilated from the air. While doing so, the air regiments have taken heavily losses. For the upcoming counteroffensives, the VVS-KBF and PVO of Leningrad will have to be rebuilt.>

<GOF41WinterFiDb> <As of Feb 28, 1942 the Germans so far have failed to take Leningrad, but have put the city under a devastating siege and heavy air attacks. We have accomplished all goals of our war, but while 200.000 reservists are demobilized, a state of war still exists with the Soviet Union, even if actual combat is limited to air combat and static warfare in front of Leningrad. We will hold the front and wait how the general situation of the German-Russian war develops before entering peace negotiations on our terms with the Soviets.>

At the beginning of December 1941 attacks by the Italian forces were stopped by the sudden five day offensive of British armed forces under the command of General Sir Archibald Wavell and General Sir Richard O'Connor.

<Africa41DeBr> <The scale of German military efforts towards helping Mussolini has increased. In April, I./JG-27 was moved at an airfield in Al Gazal, Libya. First operations of I./JG-27 fighters were completed on 19 April. The deployment of German fighters in the next ten months relieved the plight of Italian ground forces engaged in heavy fighting with the British.>
	
<Africa41DeDb> <At this time the situation in Northern Africa turned unfavourable for the Axis forces and there was a high probability that German and Italian forces could be forced out of Africa, putting the long-thought plans of Mussolini for capturing the entire Egypt under severe threat. Under the terms of the Steel Pact Hitler has pledged military support to the Italian dictator, but Mussolini also had his own ambitious plans.>

<Africa42DeBr> <At the beginning of April 1941, divisions of Deutsches Afrika Korps left the vicinity of Tobruk. German fighters were based at Al Gazal: this airfield was only eight miles west of the port. Messerschmitt pilots provided reliable cover to crews of Ju-87B-2 from IV./StG 2, periodically concluding raids for the defence of Tobruk. Counter attacks of the Allies were mainly in the form of attack of German troop positions. Air combats between the Luftwaffe and Allied fighters became more frequent.>

<Africa42DeDb> <After the fall of Tobruk, Axis forces continued to pursue the retreating enemy, covering 50km per day. Allied air forces were in a critical situation because they did not have the time to move East after the advances made by the motorised divisions of ground forces. On the other hand air support provided to Rommel's forces notably weakened: that had been undoubtedly a success for the British. Nevertheless the allied retreat threatened to become an escape right up to the gates of Cairo. RAF fighters, which could have provided cover to the columns going East, practically failed to appear in the sky.>

<Africa42tDeBr> <Main action tactics of the German fighters were based on superiority in speed: diving, attack and swift exit; taking part in dogfights needed to be avoided, if possible. Such tactics proved extremely effective in air combats over the desert. Excellent visibility was also on the side of the Luftwaffe: Allied planes were often attacked while still together in formation before they had time to react to the danger.>

<Africa40ItBr> <At the time when Italy declared war to Great Britain and France subdivisions of Africa Orientale Italiana (AOI) were in unenviable positions. Parts of AOI were cut off from the motherland and were based in a territory, fully surrounded by colonies of countries hostile to Italy. In addition, subdivisions of AOI were equipped with an out-of-date armament. On June 10th 1940 AOI had all in all 323 airplanes, 83 of which were considered not suitable to fly. AOI had 14 CR.42 and 32 CR.32 fighters in four squadrillie. Air forces of the Commonwealth countries opposing AOI consisted of 370 airplanes, which were also classified as "antiques". Nevertheless, the British had a few modern Hurricane fighters and Blenheim bombers. Unlike the Italians, the Allies could reinforce their air group in East Africa without problems.>

<Africa40ItDb> <Taking the initiative, in short space of time the Italians took British-occupied Somaliland, allowing air-forces of AOI to establish air superiority and thus conducting bombing runs on Burao airport, La Farouq and Hergeisa. Italians even attacked English marine escorts far in the Red sea. During one such flight mission, conducted on 11 February 1941, Captain Mario Vicentini, an ace who had 17 victories on his account died.>

<Africa41ItBr> < The emergence of the Germans in Africa and especially the Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, little-known at that time, was instrumental in rising of moral spirit of the Italian soldiers and officers. Warfare action restarted with renewed strength. Fighters with crests from Fliegerfuhrer Africa appeared in the air. Due to shortage of modern airplanes in the 5 Squadra Aerea this squadron contributed very little to the new offensive operation of the Axis forces on the North African theatre of the war. The Italian air force operated mainly at night.>

<Africa41ItDb> <Compared to other subdivisions 5 Squadra Aereas distinct activity for its fighters was to provide cover for Ju-87 dive bombers from the Luftwaffe. In the course of spring-summer 1941 close and strengthened cooperation between Regia Aeronautica and Luftwaffe was created, especially on subdivisions level.>

<Africa42ItBr> <At the beginning of January 1942 the British troops have just moved up to Al Adjeila, but at this time they were expecting to be in control of the whole of Libya. Rommel inflicted a devastating blow to the plans of the Allies. Desert Fox began a counter offensive on January 21st. All available Italian fighter planes pursued the enemy retreating in panic. On January 29th the Germans and the Italians have taken back Benghazi, where planes of 6 and 160 Gruppo were immediately relocated; 8 Gruppo were also shifted to the East at Al-Adjeila, 3 Gruppo at Sidi-Al-Ahmar.>

<Africa42ItDb> <After the fall of Tobruk Axis forces continued to pursue the retreating enemy, covering 50km per day. Allied air forces were in a critical situation because they did not have the time to move East after the advances made by the motorised divisions of ground forces. On the other hand air support provided to Rommel's forces notably weakened: that had been undoubtedly a success for the British. Nevertheless the allied retreat threatened to become an escape right up to the gates of Cairo. RAF fighters, which could have provided cover to the columns going East, practically failed to appear in the sky.>

<Africa42tItBr> <Despite the heroic behaviours shown by Italian and German soldiers, Rommel's attacks on Al-Alamein stalled. RAF air strikes in the desert on Rommel's armour proved quite effective. On October 23rd it became very clear: the second battle at Al Alamein finished with the defeat of the Axis forces. From now on fortune turned its back on Axis troops.>

<Africa42tItDb> <On November 8th operation "Torch" started: landing of British-American troops in North-African colonies of Vichy France. For Rommel it became instantly clear that the fate of the campaign in North Africa had already been decided: his armies had only the option to fight for survival, and a victory march in Cairo was out of question. The Allies locked Deutsches Afrika Korps on the territory of Western Libya and Tunisia.>

<BerlinTLDUSUsBr> <Berlin area, 1945: the Ardennes offensive has been repulsed and the russian Army is closing on Berlin. Still, the 8th Air Force is constantly bombing the city. During recent days, the enemy has started to emply Jet fighters to attack our bombers. Use team work to defeat these Me 262s which are causing losses among our bombers.>
<BerlinTLDUSUsDb> <The Jet menace was finally ended in a series of massive air raids against their bases which forced the Jet units to abandon their bases around Berlin and evacuate farther south, where they cannot harm anybody. With the russians in Berlin, the war is almost over and we can all go home soon!>

<BerlinTLDRLFDeBr> <Berlin area, 1945: the Russian offensive of Summer 44 had pushed us back almost to the 1937 borders of Germany. In February 1945, the Soviets attacked East Prussia. The Kriegsmarine launched an all out effort to save as many soldiers and civilians as possible, and the fighting over a small bridgehead near Pillau is still ongoing, as well as on Hela. The Soviets will soon launch their final offensive on Berlin. After the Ardennes offensive and the failed Operation Bodenplatte, most RLV fighter units have been assigned to the East front, leaving the defence against the US air raids to the Jet fighters of JG 7. Luftflotte 6 has an impressive order of battle, more units ever since Operation Barbarossa. But most units are understrenght, short on fuel and have only novice pilots. The key of success will be the Oder crossings. If we can destroy the Bridges across the Oder, the Soviets will not be able to advance. Gefechtsverband Bohrmann is tasked with that, and all fighter units will support it, as well as fly Jabo missions against Soviet troops. Air supremacy is only a secondary task, due to the huge enemy advantage in numbers. This is going to be our last stand. Especially since the treacherous murder attempt on 20th July last year, the Fhrer expects fanatical resistance and total devotion to duty!>
<BerlinTLDRLFDeDb> <In late February, the Soviets crossed the Oder. An intense air campaign during which every possible weapon was used against the bridges began. However, it proved impossible to destroy the bridges permanently. A last major defensive battle at the Seelower Hhen didn't buy much time and Berlin was surrounded by end of March. The Luftwaffe did what it could, mostly close support missions, but was not able to make any difference. On 2nd May finally, the Fhrer died in his Bunker and the city surrendered. Karl Dnitz, his successor, has build a provisional government in Flensburg and tries to salvage what is possible from the East, but the war is lost.

<BalatonTLDDESTUKAWinterDeBr> <Lake Balaton: Operation Fruhlings Ehrwachen, Spring 1945. Soviet forces surrounded Budapest in February and took it after brutal house fighting. Now, in March, the frontline is just along the southeastern shore of the Plattensee. 1st SS Panzerkorps has been brought up to the front and will launch an offensive aimed at liberating Budapest. Luftflotte 4 and the Hungarian air force will support the Operation Frhlingserwachen. Most important tasks will be close support and escort for our jabos.>

<BalatonTLDDESTUKAWinterDeDb> < >

<BalatonTLDDESTUKADeBr> <Lake Balaton: last war month.>
<BalatonTLDDESTUKADeDb> <Operation Frhlingserwachen didn't get far. Due to mud and rain, the offensive bogged down after a few kilometres and the SS units had to withdraw in order not to get enveloped. A few days later, the Soviets launched their own offensive. Our forces were unable to stop them and by mid April the Soviets crossed the Austrian border and took Vien. Luftflotte 4 and our Hungarian brothers in arms fought bravely, shooting down a large number of Soviet planes. But Soviet and American superiority in numbers was too large to let us make a difference. A few days after Wien, Berlin fell as well. The war is over, and all Luftwaffe units are ordered to fly westward and surrender themselves to the Americans. At least most of us will have a country to return to, unlike our Hungarian comrades. You fought well, all we fought for was in vain.>

<TunisiafFrBr> <After the defeat of May-June 1940 during the Battle of France, the Arme de l'Air (French Air Force) basically split into 2 groups: the Free French, a "small troop" continuing the fight together with the British and the Soviets, and the Vichy air force, subordinated to the new French government of Vichy, cooperating with the Germans. A large part of the Vichy armed forces were stationed in North Africa. Operation Torch took place on November 8th, 1942: US and British troops landed in Morocco and Algeria. The Vichy forces fought the Allies for 3 days and then surrendered. The local French resistance fighters in Algeria contributed significantly to this swift allied victory. Soon after, the French generals based in Algiers, the capital of Algeria, decided to cooperate with the Allies and to fight against Germany and Italy. \nOn the field, you are a member of the former Vichy air force, and as a pilot during the Battle of France, you have been quite ashamed by the previous situation; you are looking forward to continue the lost fight of 1940, against the Axis forces, and to liberate France from the Nazis. \nTo that effect, you will need a new aircraft to replace your ageing French plane from 1940. Thanks mainly to American understanding and cooperation, you will be satisfied: your squadron was just reequipped with new planes made in USA. The USA agreed to accept France as a beneficiary of the Lend-Lease system. \nUSAAF Colonel Harold Willis, a veteran of Escadrille Lafayette, the legendary squadron formed in 1916 with American volunteers who gave their life for France during World War I, made an effective lobbying to make this happen. You must make our American friends happy to help us, and show them that you deserve their valuable trust! \nChurchill also wanted Great Britain to participate to this French reequipment effort, and decided to contribute as well. As a first step in March 1943, the GC II/7 Nice is rearmed with Spitfires Mk Vc and becomes the RAF squadron 326.>

<ArdennesfLFrDb> <Well, fortunately spring has come. This 1944-45 winter has been terrible: one of the coldest in history. Under very difficult weather conditions, we had to counter a desperate but very aggressive German offensive in the Ardennes. Operation Bodenplatte has failed, and the German pilots are no longer as well trained as they used to be, but they have damned good new fighters, including jets. Furthermore, the Flak is as deadly as ever, and your squadron is exhausted. However, you still have to make more efforts, until we reach the final victory! \nBetween 1943 and 1945, the French Arme de l'Air recovered from virtually nothing to become a significant force of 150,000 men, operating about 40 squadrons of bombers, fighters, reconnaissance and transport aircraft. We do have our own share of the liberation of Europe, which would have seemed inconceivable at the end of 1942, when only a few courageous men from the FAFL were fighting together with the allied air forces. These 2 years have been critical to restore the honor of French Wings. We are proud of your participation in this achievement: you certainly made French colors shine again in the skies from Europe!>

<ArdennesfSFrBr> <After the operations in Italy, Normandy, Provence and Eastern France, the German armies have evacuated almost all the French territory. However the Wehrmacht still resists in a few pockets, and we must continue to do our job, despite our heavy losses and the deadly Flak. \nSince 1943, a lot of progress has been made. The reconstruction of our Arme de l'Air is well underway, and the merger between the Free French and the former Vichy air force is now effective, thanks to the leadership of General Ren Bouscat and General Martial Valin, the former head of the Free French Air Force (FAFL). \nThis has not been an easy task. Some of our colleagues from the former FAFL still claim that we did not join the Allies early enough, and there are many tensions among ourselves. Nevertheless on the field, it is victory that matters, not politics. And you certainly give all what you have to reach this goal! \nWe also face a lot of delays: it is difficult for the Allies to deliver to us all the planes we need. Maybe our planning was too ambitious. There are also difficulties and delays in the training of our new pilots. Nevertheless, we carry on with determination and our new French air force is growing at a fast pace, unthinkable in 1942.>

<BerlinfSFrDb> <Between 1943 and 1945, the French Arme de l'Air was not only rearmed by the Allies. The Arme de l'Air was rather reborn, which implies not only the reequipment with new aircraft, the training of new personnel and the participation in air war operations, but also and most importantly, a modern organization with a new fighting spirit. By contributing to the allied victory, the Arme de l'Air regained its pride, and its members could go back home with dignity. You as an individual played a role with your squadron mates in this rebirth process, and our nation will always be thankful to your dedication in this war. \nWe are also very grateful to our American and British friends, who definitely made all this possible thanks to their equipment and their willingness to include us in their operations.
