	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<DeCAP>		<\nKameraden!\nToday you are hunting Amis in the %s area. As you know the air activity has been extra hot in the recent days, so be on the lookout at all times!\n>
<DeCAP>		<\nDestination for today is going to be %s. As the area has seen increased amount of fighting in the recent day there is an almost 100%% probability of encountering enemy planes in the air.\n>
<DeCAP>		<\nAll right, your primary objective for today is to patrol the %s airspace. You'll have the added benefit of friendly flak below, so the enemy will most likely not loiter long in the area. Don't follow anyone out of your assigned sector however, in case more than one group of enemy planes passes through.\n>
<DeCAP>		<\nKameraden, as a breather from your usual intercept and ground attack duties, we're doing some good old-fashioned air combat today! The %s area has recently become a prime attraction with Ami planes, and all of us can hope to score a kill or two!\n>
<DeCAP>		<\nKameraden!\nWe are ordered to the %s sector today. Amis have a huge numerical superiority in the overall area of operations, but we can still put enough planes in a given sector to have control over local airspace. Let's surprise the Indians today and put a wall of steel on their way to target.Another raid on this city, apparently. We will scramble to intercept these American sky bandits. Keep on attacking until you run out of ammo and try to avoid the escort fighters, if at all possible!>
<DeCAP>		<\nKameraden!\nI don't have to tell you how important each one of you is to our overall war effort. We don't have many planes to spare, and each mission you fly should have as much effect as possible. Today our squadron is sent up to patrol the %s airspace.\n>
<DeCAP>		<\nLater on today our Jabos will fly several missions striking important targets near the front line. They will have to pass through the %s area on the way to target, and that happens to be a new favorite spot for American fighters to patrol. You're flying there now to ensure the airspace is squeaky clean for our Jabos later. Cover a wide area, aggressively seek out Ami planes and make sure they can't stay in the air to intercept our strike flights.\n>
<DeCAS>		<\nKameraden! Our today's target is located near %s. I don't have to tell you how important the area is for the ground war, and you'll be doing our troops down below a huge service by striking the Anglo-American forces there.\n>
<DeCAS>		<\nKameraden!\nWe are striking the %s area in today's mission. It's important from both the strategic and tactical standpoint. The Amis know this too, so don't expect a walk in the park today.\n>
<DeCAS>		<\nAll right, it's another ground attack mission for us today. The target is %s. There have been massive enemy troop movements in the recent days, so in addition to your primary target you can expect plenty of targets of opportunity throughout the mission area.\n>
<DeCAS>		<\nMore ground pounding for you boys today. Target: %s. It's not going to be easy this time, the area is swarming with trigger happy Amis. You can expect to receive plenty of flak throughout the mission.\n>
<DeCAS>		<\nKameraden!\nOur today's objective is %s. The intelligence is spotty and we're don't know the exact situation around the target, but rest assured there'll be plenty of Amis. Ground war has been quite hectic there lately, so expect all sorts of juicy targets scattered around the countryside.\n>
<DeCAS>		<\nKameraden!\nIt's time to pay our jazz-listening negro-loving civilian-murdering American friends another visit. They're long overdue for our special delivery in the %s sector.\n>
<DeCAS>		<\nKameraden!\nAs you can probably tell by the mechanics loading ground ordnance on your planes, you're flying another ground attack mission today. Target: %s.\n>

<DeEsc>		<\nKameraden!\nFor this mission you will be escorting our Jabos on their way to %s. Heavy enemy fighter presence is expected, so stay above the Jabos at all times and do not leave them to engage in dogfights with the Amis.\n>
<DeEsc>		<\nKameraden!\nIt's time for another escort mission. Our Jabos are hitting %s again. The last time they suffered heavy casualties from American Mustangs. Do your job and make sure it doesn't happen this time.\n>
<DeEsc>		<\nAnother escort mission for us today. Some of you may remember %s, our target for today, from a while ago. It was a good mission back then, a complete surprise to the Americans, with no losses to our bombers and a few confirmed kills for our squadron. Let's keep it this way today.\n>
<DeEsc>		<\nKameraden!\nLooks like we're about to have some fun today. You'll be escorting some bombers to %s and back. Expect plenty of flak, and plenty of Luftwaffe planes in the air.\n>
<DeEsc>		<\nAll right boys, listen up! I have good news for those of you who are itching to rack up some kills. Later in the day our Jabos are mounting a large raid on a very juicy target, %s. Ami fighters are sure to be there. As the primary escort you should see plenty of action.\n>
<DeEsc>		<\nKameraden!\nOur Jabos continues to have considerable success destroying Anglo-American forces on the ground, and it is again our duty today to escort them to an important target. This time it's %s.\n>
<DeEsc>		<\nKameraden!\nYour today's mission involves escorting some Jabos to %s. Most of you have done this before, so I'm going to be brief. Stay above the bombers, maintain strict radio discipline, do not get involved in dogfights. Keep your head on a swivel, and try to come home safe.\n>

<DeEscP>	<\nKameraden!\nFor this mission you are escorting some old good Tante Jus which will be dropping paratroops over %s. Do your job well gentlemen, don't let the Amis bring down planes full of our troops before they reach their target.\n>
<DeEscR>	<\nKameraden!\nToday our high-speed recon plane will be photographing the %s area. >
<DeRecAF>	<\nKameraden!\nWe have reports of extremely heavy enemy air activity at our old %s airfield. Our intelligence is dying to get more information on the types and numbers of planes stationed there.\n>

<DeRecAFD> <Bring back photographs, we have to know what is going on there. >
<DeRecAFD> <We have to know what they have there. >

<DeScramSit>	<\nAir raid! This is no drill! Enemy bombers are reported inbound! >
<DeScramSit>	<\nAlarm, alarm! Enemy planes are on their way towards our airfield! >
<DeScramSit>	<\nEnemy planes inbound! We barely have time to get to altitude! Let's go, let's go, let's go! >
<DeScram>	<Take off immediately, don't sit around waiting in the pattern! >
<DeScram>	<Our whole geschwader is parked out in the open, don't let them destroy our planes on the ground! >
<DeSwp>		<\nKameraden!\nWe're going to %s today. >
<DeTranInt>	<\nKameraden!\n%s is an important strategic objective both for us and the Germans. Wehrmacht and SS troops there are largely supplied from the air, so by destroying enemy transports you can help to tip the local balance greatly in our favor.\n>
<DeTranIntD> <\nKameraden!\nToday we're going to be hunting easy prey, American transport planes. Keep your airspeed up, stay clear of the escorts, and ignore any targets of opportunity on the ground.\n>
<DeTranRep>	<\nKameraden!\nOur squadron is being moved away from moving the front line. %s will probably be used by another Geschwader, %s will be our new home for now.\n>
<DeTranRep>	<\nKameraden, we have to leave %s on really short order. You only have a few hours to pack your things. Our whole Geschwader has to be operational at %s no later than tomorrow.\n>
<DeTranRep>	<\nKameraden!\nAs you know the front line is moving fast, and without much notice we're leaving %s and moving to our new home, %s.\n>

<RuCAPCaen>		<\nGentlemen!\nToday we're going to stalk Jerry over Caen. As all of you of course know, Caen is the largest city in Normandy, an important junction of major lines of communications, and a key to the highway leading straight to Paris.\nAs you know the air activity has been extra hot in the recent days, so be on the lookout at all times!\n>
<RuCAPCaen>		<\nGentlemen!\nToday you are hunting Jerry over Caen. As you know the air activity has been extra hot in the recent days, so be on the lookout at all times!\n>
<RuCAPCaen>		<\nTarget for today is going to be Caen. We continue to seek out enemy planes in the air and on the ground, and as the area has seen increased amount of fighting in the recent day there is a high chance of encountering enemy planes in the air.\n>
<RuCAPCaen>		<\nAll right boys, your primary objective today is the Caen airspace. The area is very important as our bombers often pass over it on their way back from the target, so Germans love to loiter there looking for stragglers.\n>
<RuCAPBastogne>		<\nTarget for today is Bastogne. The Jerry is really dying to take that city away from us, and our boys on the ground are dying trying to hold it. You can bet your sweet asses that Luftwaffe is going to come there looking for action, and our boys on the ground really depend on you to keep German bombs from falling on their heads.\n>
<RuCAPBastogne>		<\nGentlemen!\nYou are assigned to patrol Bastogne today. We have a huge numerical superiority in our overall area of operations but Jerry can occasionally put enough planes in a given sector to have control over local airspace. Other fighter groups are patrolling nearby sectors, so get your aircraft recognition up to speed and make sure it's a Jerry before firing.\n>
<RuCAPFalaise>		<\nAll right boys, your primary objective today is the Falaise airspace. I don't have to tell you men how important the Falaise is to our war effort. The Germans have gathered a huge amount of equipment and men in the area, and control over the city airspace would give us a chance to really hurt Hitler without sacrificing a lot of our men on the ground.\n>
<RuCAPPointe_Du_Hoc>		<\nGentlemen, as a breather from your usual escort and ground attack duties, we're doing some good old-fashioned  air combat today! We're going to try to wrestle the control of the air space away from the Germans over this area called Pointe Du Hoc. It's the highest elevation point on the whole beach, and the Germans set up a well fortified position there which can single-handedly defeat a large invasion force. It's imperative that it's destroyed from the air before it can cause trouble for us on the ground.\n>

<RuCAP>		<\nGentlemen!\nToday you are hunting Jerry in the %s area. As you know the air activity has been extra hot in the recent days, so be on the lookout at all times!\n>
<RuCAP>		<\nTarget for today is going to be %s. We continue to seek out enemy planes in the air and on the ground, and as the area has seen increased amount of fighting in the recent day there is a high chance of encountering enemy planes in the air.\n>
<RuCAP>		<\nAll right boys, your primary objective today is the %s airspace. The area is very important as our bombers often pass over it on their way back from the target. Our flak out there is not yet well organized, so Jerry loves to loiter there looking for stragglers.\n>
<RuCAP>		<\nGentlemen, as a breather from your usual escort and ground attack duties, we're doing some good old-fashioned  air combat today! The %s area has been swarming with Luftwaffe planes lately, so all of you can hope to score a kill or two.\n>
<RuCAP>		<\nGentlemen!\nYou are assigned to patrol the %s sector today. We have a huge numerical superiority in our overall area of operations but Jerry can occasionally put enough planes in a given sector to have control over local airspace. Other fighter groups are patrolling nearby sectors, so get your aircraft recognition up to speed and make sure it's a Jerry before firing.\n>
<RuCAP>		<\nThere are several high importance targets in the area, and with our somewhat limited forces we're being spread thin. For today our focus is going to be on protecting our own airspace in favor of attacking enemy targets. You are going to patrol over %s today. Don't follow anyone out of your assigned sector, stay there in case more than one group of enemy planes decides to attack.\n>
<RuCAS>		<\nAll right, it's mud moving time! I'm sure you'll be happy to know that the geniuses at the top have you going to a little town called %s. You might have heard the area referred to as flak alley, but supposedly that's been cleaned up recently.\n>
<RuCAS>		<\nGentlemen! Our target for today is located near %s. I don't have to tell you how important the area is for the ground war, and you'll be doing our boys down below a huge service by striking the Germans there.\n>
<RuCAS>		<\nGentlemen!\nWe are striking the %s area in today's mission. It's important from both the strategic and tactical standpoint. The Germans know this too, so don't expect a walk in the park today.\n>
<RuCAS>		<\nAll right, it's another ground attack mission for you boys. The target is located in %s. There have been massive enemy troop movements in the recent days, so in addition to your primary target you can expect a plenty of targets of opportunity throughout the mission area.\n>
<RuCAS>		<\nMore ground pounding for you boys today. Target : %s. It's not going to be easy this time, the area is swarming with trigger happy Germans. You can expect to receive plenty of flak throughout the mission.\n>
<RuCAS>		<\nGentlemen!\nOur today's objective is %s. The intelligence is spotty and we're not quite sure what you'll be attacking, but rest assured you'll hit something. Enemy ground activity has been quite hectic there lately, so there will be no shortage of targets of opportunity.\n>
<RuCAS>		<\nGentlemen!\nIt's time to pay our friends in the Wehrmacht another visit, they've been long overdue for our special delivery in the %s sector.\n>
<RuCAS>		<\nGentlemen!\nThe command probably has heard some of our pilots complain about repetitive missions. So today for something completely different you'll be attacking ground targets in the %s sector.\n>
<RuCAS>		<\nGentlemen!\nAs you could probably tell by the mechanics loading ground ordnance on your planes, you're flying another ground attack mission today. Target: %s.\n>

<RuEsc>		<\nEscort duty for you boys today. B-17s are going to be missing every possible target in the %s area, and you have to make sure they can't blame it on the Luftwaffe.\n>
<RuEsc>		<\nGentlemen!\nFor this mission you will be escorting B-17s on their mission to %s. Heavy enemy fighter presence is expected, so stay with the bombers at all times and do not engage in dogfights with the German fighters.\n>
<RuEsc>		<\nGentlemen!\nIt's time for another escort mission. B-17s are bombing %s again. The last time they suffered heavy casualties on their return trip. Do your job gentlemen and make sure it doesn't happen this time.\n>
<RuEsc>		<\nAnother escort mission for us today. Some of you may remember %s, our target for today, from a while ago. It was a good mission back then, with no losses to the bombers and a few confirmed kills for ourselves. Let's keep it this way today.\n>
<RuEsc>		<\nGentlemen!\nLooks like we're about to have some fun today. You'll be escorting some bombers all the way to %s and back. Expect plenty of flak, and plenty of Luftwaffe planes in the air.\n>
<RuEsc>		<\nAll right boys, listen up! I have good news for those of you who are itching to rack up some kills. Later in the day our Forts are mounting a large raid on a very juicy target, %s. The Luftwaffe is sure to be there. As the primary escort you should see plenty of action.\n>
<RuEsc>		<\nGentlemen!\nOur bombers continues to have considerable success destroying Hitler's machine of war, and it is again our duty today to escort them to an important target. This time it's %s.\n>
<RuEsc>		<\nBoys, listen up! Today's mission has just been ordered, we're being sent up immediately with little time for planning. Apparently a British recon just came back with some photos from %s, and it's important enough to send a bunch of B-17s there. You'll be escorting them all the way to target and back.\n>
<RuEsc>		<\nGentlemen!\nYour today's mission involves escorting some 17s to %s. Most of you have done this before, so I'm going to be brief. Stay above the bombers, maintain strict radio discipline, do not get involved in dogfights. Keep your head on a swivel, and try to come home safe.\n>
<RuEsc>		<\nAll right. I know about half of you boys are hoping to strafe and bomb some poor Wehrmacht bastards today, while the other half is itching to mix it up with Goering's boys in the air. So, I got good news for all of yous. First you'll be escorting B-17s to %s, after which time you're free to come down and look for targets of opportunity on the ground.\n>

<UsDDayPara> <\nGentlemen!\nTonight paratroopes of the 101st Airborne Division will be dropped over %s to soften up the German troops and to secure important targets. We do not expect any German fighters, but your assistance may be needed to suppress or destroy searchlights and FLAK if the C47s will come under fire.\n>
<UsDDayPara> <\nGentlemen!\nTonight paratroopes of the 82nd Airborne Division will be dropped over %s to soften up the German troops and to secure important targets. We do not expect any German fighters, but your assistance may be needed to suppress or destroy searchlights and FLAK if the C47s will come under fire.\n>
<UsDDayCAS>	<\nGentlemen! The invasion has begun! I don't have to tell you how important it is to keep our troops on the beach on the first day, and you'll be doing our boys down below a huge service by hitting Jerry around the landing sites.\n>
<UsDDayCAS>	<\nGentlemen!\nAt around 4:30 this morning first elements of our forces have landed at beaches in Normandy. So far their success has been remarkable, and at this time all landing beaches are firmly in our hands. However, the Germans still possess enough force to throw us back into the sea. Your mission today is to make sure it doesn't happen. Search and destroy anything German that moves anywhere near the beach, with special attention given to armor and static defences.\n>

<RuEscP>	<\nGentlemen!\nToday we will be providing top cover for a paradrop over %s. I don't have to tell you how important this mission is, and that every C-47 contains twice as many men as a B-17. We can't avoid some of them dying on the ground, but at least make sure they don't die in the C-47s on the way to target.\n>
<RuEscP>	<\nGentlemen!\nFor this mission you are escorting C-47s which will be dropping paratroops over %s. Do your job well gentlemen, don't let the Germans bring down planes full of our troops before they reach their target.\n>
<RuEscR>	<\nGentlemen!\nToday our recon plane will photograph important targets near %s. >
<RuRecAF>	<Gentlemen!\nWe need to evaluate the status of the Luftwaffe airbase at %s.\n>
<RuRecAFR>	<Bring back good photos, we have to know what is going on there. >
<RuScramSit>	<\nScramble, scramble, scramble! We have reports of an incoming air rad! >
<RuScramSit>	<\nAir raid! This is no drill! Enemy bombers are reported inbound! >
<RuScramSit>	<\nAlarm, alarm! Enemy planes are on their way towards our airfield! >
<RuScramSit>	<\nEnemy planes inbound! We barely have time to get to altitude! Let's go, let's go, let's go! >
<RuScram>	<Take off immediately, don't sit in the pattern! >
<RuScram>	<Our whole squadron is parked out in the open, don't let them destroy our planes on the ground. >
<RuSwp>		<\nGentlemen!\nWe're going to %s today. >
<RuTranInt>	<\nGentlemen!\n%s is an important strategic objective both for us and the Germans. Wehrmacht and SS troops there are largely supplied from the air, so by destroying enemy transports you can help to tip the local balance greatly in our favor.\n>
<RuTranIntR>	<Gentlemen!\nToday we're going to be hunting easy prey, German transport planes. Keep your airspeed up, stay clear of the escorts, and ignore any targets of opportunity on the ground.\n>
<RuTranRep>	<\nGentlemen!\nOur squadron is being moved forwards closer to the front line. %s will be used by another fighter group, %s will be our new home for now.\n>
<RuTranRep>	<\nAll right boys, pack your bags and say goodbye to your girlfriends. We're leaving %s and moving to %s.\n>
<RuTranRep>	<\nGentlemen, we have to leave %s on really short order. You only have a few hours to pack your things. Our whole FG has to be operational at %s no later than tomorrow.\n>
<RuTranRep>	<\nGentlemen!\nAs you know the front line is moving fast, and without much notice we're leaving %s and moving to our new home, %s.\n>
<YourAF>	<\nYou are stationed at %s. >

	The following messages will continue the briefing. They will go after first part. 
	Message ID is build as situation code plus side code. 
	RuBTrainR means that Russians bomb German train, and briefing is for Russians. 
	RuBTrainD means the same situation but briefing is for Germans.	
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<RuBTrainR>	<The forts are hitting the railway junction. I don't have to tell you how important railways are for supplies. We can hope to seriously disrupt German operations in this whole area if we put this rail yard out of commission.\n>
<RuBTrainR>	<The bombers are hitting the rail station there. Hopefully they will kill two birds with one stone by destroying the tanks and halftracks that's recently been delivered there, as well as taking the station out of commission and preventing any new shipments of German war material.\n>
<RuBTrainR>	<The bombers will attack the railway station there. In the event of light enemy air opposition you are authorized to leave them after they drop their eggs, and attack targets of opportunity on the ground.\n>
<RuBTrainR>	<The forts are bombing the rail yard in the city. It's not the busiest yard in the region, but we've already bombed most of the important ones and the command is just going down the list. Light to medium flak expected, light to no air opposition. In other words, this won't be Schweinfurt, you guys can relax.\n>

<RuBTrainD>	<American Jabos are constantly harassing our supply trains in that area. Your patrol area is concentrated over the most likely attack point for the Amis. You can expect small formations of enemy Jabos arriving at high speed and extremely low altitude.\n>
<RuBTrainD>	<The railway network there is under constant attack from enemy Jabos and bombers. Today it is your task to stop them. Good luck my friends, bring home some victories!\n>
<RuBTrainD>	<The Reichsbahn is complaining about our apparent inability to stop attacks on their trains. As a demonstration, the Fliegerführer has ordered all fighters to patrol over the supply routes and hunt for enemy Jabos.\n>
<RuBTrainD>	<Our primary objective for today is protection of the Reichsbahn from enemy Jabos. We are losing too many trains to air attacks, and Anglo-American Jabo pilots feel extremely secure over our territory. Let's make their lives a little harder today, shall we?\n>

<RuATrainR>	<Your number one priority is the railway traffic. Be careful as civilian traffic still continues in the area, you might want to simply destroy the locomotives on the civilian trains.\n>
<RuATrainR>	<Railway remains to be the fastest way for the Germans to resupply their front-line troops. Fly along the railways in your assigned sector, seek out and destroy any trains you see.\n>
<RuATrainR>	<The importance of railway for the German war effort cannot be overstated. Hit any trains you see, destroy German troops and war material before they have a chance to fire a shot at our boys on the ground!\n>
<RuATrainR>	<We've received information from the Resistance that for the past few days a whole SS Panzer division has been arriving there by rail. Any trains you find in the vicinity will likely contain either veteran tank crews from Russia, or brand new Tiger tanks fresh from the factory. Don't leave a single rail car intact.\n>

<RuATrainD>	<The Reichsbahn is reporting that constant air attack is making traffic almost impossible. The front depends on the railway system, so we have to patrol over an important route and protect it from enemy Jabos.\n>
<RuATrainD>	<Our troops are suffering from lack of supplies. Enemy air attack is constantly destroying trains, and the traffic jams they create sometimes take days to clear. This has to stop! Today, you will fly patrol over our supply routes shoot down enemy Jabos that pass through the area.\n>
<RuATrainD>	<Our Landsers on both fronts are fighting heroically, and they need supplies to continue their fight. The enemy Jabo activity against the Reichsbahn network has to be stopped! We ourselves are dependant on the railroad. Stop enemy air attacks, or we might find ourselves grounded without spare parts or replacement pilots.\n>
<RuATrainD>	<Since most of the highway bridges in the area have been destroyed in the past few months, our supplies in this sector greatly depend on rail lines. Groups of Allied Jabos cross the front lines several times every day, and they destroy an alarming number of our planes. Find them today kameraden, and prevent them from destroying any more trains.\n>

<DeBTrainR>	<Yesterday no less than seven separate supply trains have been bombed in the sector marked on your map. With the way Luftwaffe is now organized this could just be a fluke, but we just can't take that risk. We have to assume this is an organized effort, and therefore we're assigning you to patrol the railways there. You can expect small formations of bomb-carrying Focke-Wulfs attempting to penetrate our airspace at low altitudes.\n>
<DeBTrainR>	<Since most of the highway bridges in the area have been destroyed in the past few months, our supplies in this sector greatly depend on rail lines. Small groups of German aircraft penetrate our defenses daily and destroy an occasional train or two. Find them gentlemen, and destroy them.\n>
<DeBTrainR>	<Despite our best efforts the Germans occasionally mount a successful sortie that scores some hits on our supply trains. These raids become increasingly more organized, as the Germans are encouraged by our inability to stop them. Today we're going to specifically focus our efforts on protecting the rail lines. Hopefully we're going to surprise the Germans, and you'll finally mix it up with a sizeable German force in the air.\n>
<DeBTrainR>	<German resistance in the air across the whole front is becoming increasingly sporadic. The Luftwaffe today is nothing like what they were a year ago. You'll be protecting our supply trains, which the Germans continue to attack from time to time. At the end of your time on station you can feel free to cross the front lines and strafe some Kraut convoys in response.\n>
<DeBTrainR>	<With most of our forces dedicated to a large-scale bomber raid we don't have the usual amount of planes protecting of our own airspace. The Luftwaffe of course will also be expected to focus on the air raid, but we can't exclude the possibility of an attack on our own positions. You are assigned to patrol the sector marked on your map, specifically focusing on our supply routes. Good luck.\n>

<DeBTrainD>	<Our Jabos are hitting the rail station there. Hopefully they will kill two birds with one stone by destroying the tanks and halftracks that's recently been delivered there, as well as taking the station out of commission and preventing the Allies from delivering reinforcements to the front so quickly.\n>
<DeBTrainD>	<The Americans have started to repair the rail network they destroyed themselves and are using it to supply the front. Our Jabos will attempt to take the railways out of commision again. The Allies know very well that their supply lines are vulnerable to our attacks, so expect pretty sizeable opposition in the air.\n>
<DeBTrainD>	<A staffel of Jabos will attack the railway station there. In the unlikely event of light enemy air opposition you are authorized to leave them after they drop their eggs, and attack additional targets of opportunity on the ground.\n>
<DeBTrainD>	<The enemy is increasingly more reliant on railway transport for their supplies. Thanks to their air superiority, attacks are very difficult and meet hell both from flak on the ground, and fighters in the air. While there's little you can do about flak, you can hopefully help the Jabos with the fighters. Good luck today!>
<DeBTrainD>	<The Jabos will be hitting the railway traffic in the area. Light to medium flak expected, but medium to heavy opposition from the air. You'll probably have it harder than the Jabos today. Protect them at all costs. Don't let enemy Mustangs get through to them. Good luck!\n>

<DeATrainR>	<Krauts are really becoming too comfortable over our sector! Just yesterday two separate instances of supply trains being strafed were reported. Everybody's taking heat for that, starting from your CO and all the way up to the Air Force HQ. Take this very seriously men. If any of our trains get strafed today the group CO is going to have my ass.\n>
<DeATrainR>	<Despite our best efforts the Germans occasionally mount a successful sortie that scores some hits on our supply trains. These raids become increasingly more organized, as the Germans are encouraged by our inability to stop them. Today we're going to specifically focus our efforts on protecting the rail lines. This is in your best interests too, as the next train they strafe could mean nothing but SPAM for the next week for the whole squadron.\n>
<DeATrainR>	<German resistance in the air across the whole front is becoming increasingly sporadic. The Luftwaffe today is nothing like what they were a year ago. You'll be protecting our supply trains, which are probably not the highest priority targets for the Germans. Still, don't get distracted and stick to your objective. Best of luck gentlemen!\n>
<DeATrainR>	<Your objective today is protect our rail lines in the area. I know most of you are itching to get over the front lines and hit the Germans where it hurts the most, but somebody's gotta stay behind and protect our rear. This happens to be us this time. Do your job well today, and I'm sure soon we'll get to do more dangerous assignments.\n>

<DeATrainD>	<Today, we will conduct a railway hunt in that area. Railway remains to be the fastest way for the Americans to resupply their front-line troops. Fly along the railways in your assigned sector, seek out and destroy any trains you see. And be on the look out for Indianer at all times!\n>
<DeATrainD>	<The enemy has repaired the railway net destroyed by his own bombs and is using it to transfer supplies to the front. Today you will fly railway hunt and attack everything you see. Be careful, enemy fighters have to be expected!\n>
<DeATrainD>	<Today you fly railway hunt. Stay low and fast, and hopefully this will minimize your exposure to flak and decrease your chances of being spotted by Ami fighters. The area is swarming with Indianer though, so get it and get out as soon as you can. Good luck!\n>
<DeATrainD>	<The importance of railway for the Allied war effort cannot be overstated. Hit any trains you see, destroy enemy troops and war material before they have a chance to fire a shot at our Landsers at the front!\n>
<DeATrainD>	<We have reliable information that for the past few days a whole American Tank Army has been arriving there by rail. Any trains you find in the vicinity will likely contain tank crews and brand new tanks fresh from the factories. Don't leave a single rail car intact.\n>

<RuBShipR>	<The bombers will be hitting enemy naval targets. Your biggest headache will be from flak, however you may also see a few disorganized fighter cackles in the air. Stay with the bombers, and feel free to leave them and strafe targets of opportunity after they drop their bombs.\n>
<RuBShipR>	<The Forts are going to hit some naval and coastal targets in the air. You know the drill: stay above the bombers, scare off any enemy fighters, and return back to your positions as soon as they leave the area.\n>

<RuBShipD>	<Kameraden, our coastal convoys are under constant allied air attack. We will patrol over German shipping and intercept allied bombers.\n>
<RuBShipD>	<Our comrades from the S-Boat Flotilla in le Havre are constantly attacking the allied beachhead. Today, we will fly patrol over a returning pack of S-Boats to cover their route home.\n>
<RuBShipD>	<A very important convoy carrying new secret midget submarines is arriving today. We must protect it so the K-Verband can attack the invasion fleet!\n>

<RuAShipR>	<Just when you thought Germany only had an army and an air force, we have a reminder for you that they also have a navy. Returning bombers saw some wakes in the drink, and they're not from our ships. Find the German ships and sink them.\n>
<RuAShipR>	<Germans there are receiving some supplies and reinforcements by ship. You have the pleasure of attacking those ships today, fat slow targets just asking to be strafed and bombed.\n>

<RuAShipD>	<Our picket boats in the bay are attacked constantly. We cannot afford to lose boats in that rate! Protect them!\n>
<RuAShipD>	<Kameraden, the bluejackets are suffering hard under allied air attack. Today, we will lend them a hand and protect them.\n>
<RuAShipD>	<The Kriegsmarine is evacuating the Seine Area! We must protect our ships so they can fight another day!\n>

<DeBShipR>	<The Luftwaffe has been attacking our shipping in the area for quite some time, and with all the other priority objectives and rapidly changing situation at the front we were simply unable to assign adequate protection to our shipping. Today it's going to be different, and we're hoping to surprise the Luftwaffe with the number of our fighters in the air. Protect our ships, don't let the Luftwaffe get to them.\n>
<DeBShipR>	<Majority of our troops in the new European Theater are supplied by sea. Therefore it is of the utmost importance that we maintain absolute air superiority over the Channel. You will be patrolling the area of some of the highest naval traffic, so the chance of the Krauts launching a few fighter-bombers is rather high. Watch out for high-speed recon planes as well.\n>
<DeBShipR>	<Thousands of tons of supplies are being moved daily between Europe and England, and of course that makes the Channel a very appealing target for the Krauts. Today you'll be making sure that our seamen down there can do their job without any interruptions from the Luftwaffe.\n>

<DeBShipD>	<The Kampfflieger are attacking the enemy invasion fleet. It will be a tough job. We have to keep the fighters off their backs so they can complete their attack runs. After they attack, cover their withdrawal. Our bomber losses are too high, we have to protect them!\n>
<DeBShipD>	<The bombers will attack the invasion fleet yet another time. All previous attacks have been repulsed with heavy losses. We must be successful this time!\n>
<DeBShipD>	<Our bombers are hitting the enemy invasion fleet! Heavy enemy fighter cover can be expected. Do your best to get the bombers to their target, Kameraden! Remember, saving the bombers is more important than scoring victories.\n>
<DeBShipD>	<During the last few days, all our bomber groups attacking the enemy shipping in the Seine area have been decimated. The comrades need heavy fighter cover in order to be successful. We are protecting yet another attack.\n>
<DeBShipD>	<The allied invasion is going on under heavy fighter cover! All attempts to bomb the ships have failed so far. The bombers must get through this time!\n>

<DeAShipR>	<The Luftwaffe has been attacking our shipping in the area for quite some time, and with all the other priority objectives  and rapidly changing situation at the front we were simply unable to assign adequate protection to our shipping. Today it's going to be different, and we're hoping to surprise the Luftwaffe with the number of our fighters in the air. Protect our ships, don't let the Luftwaffe get to them.\n>
<DeAShipR>	<Majority of our troops in the new European Theater are supplied by sea. Therefore it is of the utmost importance that we maintain absolute air superiority over the Channel. You will be patrolling the area of some of the highest naval traffic, so the chance of the Krauts launching a few fighter-bombers is rather high. Watch out for high-speed recon planes as well.\n>
<DeAShipR>	<Thousands of tons of supplies are being moved daily between Europe and England, and of course that makes the Channel a very appealing target for the Krauts. Today you'll be making sure that our seamen down there can do their job without any interruptions from the Luftwaffe.\n>

<DeAShipD>	<Kameraden, this is the big one. We're attacking the allied invasion fleet! May Fortune be on our side. Hals- und Beinbruch!\n>
<DeAShipD>	<The Amis and British are bringing in more supplies to their beachhead. We must interdict their shipping. Be careful, all previous raids had heavy losses. Keep formation close and speed up and get the hell out of there after you dropped bombs!\n>
<DeAShipD>	<We will carry out another attack on the enemy beachhead. Heavy Flak and fighter cover have to be expected. This is not going to be easy, Kameraden. Good Luck!\n>
<DeAShipD>	<The enemy is throwing more and more men and weapons into his beachhead. We will only be able to crush it if that flow is stopped. We have to attack their supply ships!\n>
<DeAShipD>	<We will carry out an attack on enemy shipping. Usually their convoys are heavily covered, so expect a tough run!\n>

<RuBColR>	<The forts will be concentrating on German traffic routes and supply depots. I don't have to tell you how important these types of missions are for the overall situation at the front. We can hope to seriously disrupt German operations in this whole area if we keep their supplies from reaching their troops.\n>
<RuBColR>	<The bombers will attack enemy supply routes. In the event of light enemy air opposition you are authorized to leave them after they drop their eggs, and attack targets of opportunity on the ground.\n>
<RuBColR>	<With most railways out of commision, the enemy is increasingly more reliant on highway traffic to deliver their supplies to the front. With the overall sorry state of their air force, these supply lines are mostly unprotected from the air. You will escort bombers to target in case the enemy does decide to attack. After your package bombs out, you are cleared to drop down and clean up after them.\n>

<RuBColD>	<Enemy Jabos are hunting our supply columns at will. We will be flying anti-jabo patrol in this area to teach them a lesson!\n>
<RuBColD>	<Constant Allied air attack are making any car movement by day a huge problem. Today we're going to try to relieve the situation a bit by flying patrol over some important highways, and attempt to stop roving American Jabos from attacking our traffic.\n>
<RuBColD>	<Enemy Jabos have been attacking our supply columns in that area with an almost impunity. We will fly free hunt there and interdict further Jabo attacks. Engage any enemy plane you see!\n>

<RuAColR>	<Seek out and destroy enemy ground vehicles, specifically supply trucks. No enemy air opposition is expected, so feel free to expend all your ammo stores without worrying about possible air combat.\n>
<RuAColR>	<Months of our efforts are finally paying off, and the supply situation is becoming a huge headache for the Germans. Keep the pressure up, seek out and destroy any supply convoys you may find. They will most likely be well protected and small in size. If you don't find any convoys, railway traffic is your secondary priority.\n>
<RuAColR>	<We've got the German grunt just the way we want him - hungry, miserable and without ammunition. Our air coverage over the area is so complete the Germans just can't think of any new tricks to supply their troops. They simply continue to brave it and throw small supply columns towards the front hoping at least some will get through. Find those columns, keep the Kraut miserable. As I've always said, the only good Kraut is a sour Kraut.\n>

<RuAColD>	<The Wehrmacht is suffering heavily under enemy Jabo attacks. Angry front commanders have been calling me all day and demanded cover. There's not much we can do with so few planes, but today we can at least try. Free hunt against all Jabos!\n>
<RuAColD>	<Today, we will again hunt for Jabos behind our own lines. Be careful and don't take too many chances, but always remember that with every Indian you shoot down you save many lives on the ground.\n>
<RuAColD>	<Our supply columns are under constant air attack. The Fliegerführer has ordered to undertake any effort to stop that. So we fly free hunt against Jabos. Be careful, once they notice you, the Jabos will most likely engage.\n>

<DeBColR>	<German fighter bombers are really fond of strafing out transport columns. You can understand that as fighter pilots of course, since as we all know strafing soft targets is a lot of fun. However  since we're kind of at war with the Germans, it's our duty to make sure the Germans don't have too much fun. Especially at our expense. Go out there men and have some fun of your own.\n>
<DeBColR>	<Earlier this morning our CO was woken up by a visitor from the 84th Infantry Division HQ. Apparently last night a few trucks carrying their wounded were strafed by Focke-Wulfs. Coincidentally this happened in the sector we are assigned to protect. Since our CO does not like to be woken up, and 84th Division does not like their wounded murdered on the way to the hospital, I think it's in your best interests gentlemen to go out there and defend the airspace you're assigned to defend. That is all. Good luck.\n>
<DeBColR>	<Today you are protecting the air space over the sector marked on your map, specifically this road here. It's one of the major highways in our whole area of operations, and of course our traffic there attracts a lot of attention. German planes are constantly in the area, and new burned out trucks continue to be being pushed to the side of the road every day. This means ammunition, this means food, this means lives. Do your job well today gentlemen. Keeping our ground troops alive is really your main task as a fighter pilot, and it's the only reason Uncle Sam keeps nitwits like you on payroll.\n>

<DeBColD>	<The attack squadrons are attempting to hit enemy supply columns. Protect them at all costs! Expect constant harassmet from the air througout the mission as that sector is oversaturated with enemy fighters\n>
<DeBColD>	<Recently, our Jabos had heavy losses in their attacks on enemy supply traffic. Your targets are in a direct vicinity of an Allied base, so you can expect a sizeable force to be scrambled to meet you. Good luck friends, I hope to see all of you back here when we return.\n>
<DeBColD>	<The Jabos are conducting road hunt operations there. We will protect them from enemy fighters. Jabo losses have been high recently, try to keep as many of them alive today as possible. Good luck to all of you!\n>
<DeBColD>	<Our Jabo and bomber squadrons will attempt to disrupt the enemy supply traffic behind the lines. We will fly escort for them. Should no enemy fighters show up, feel free to stick around an do some strafing yourself.\n>
<DeBColD>	<With most of railroads destroyed in this sector, Americans now heavily depend on supplies by transport columns. That's what the Jabos are hitting today. Expect strong enemy opposition fron the air. They probably don't expect an escort of this size, and with luck they just might consider you a part of the strike force and not expect you to put up a good fight. Good luck! Bring home some victories.\n>

<DeAColR>	<We're really not doing a good job protecting the roads in the Allied controlled territory. Troops suffer almost daily strafings by the Luftwaffe. German planes mostly fly in very small groups, pairs and sometimes even as single aircraft. That's why they are hard to detect and intercept, but please do your best today and protect our supply columns.\n>
<DeAColR>	<Since most of the railways in the area have been bombed by us in the past few months, the supplies in the Allied controlled territory greatly depend on transport columns. Small groups of German aircraft penetrate our defenses daily and strafe and bomb our columns. You will be patrolling your assigned sector today, and your primary objective is protection of convoy traffic.\n>
<DeAColR>	<Your primary objective for today is protection of our transport columns behind the front lines. At the end of your time on station you can feel free to cross the front lines and strafe some Kraut convoys in response.\n>

<DeAColD>	<Seek out and destroy enemy ground vehicles, specifically supply trucks. Heavy enemy air opposition is expected, so stay low and fast to minimize the possibility of being seen. Good luck!\n>
<DeAColD>	<American supplies can't seem to keep up with their advances, and this is a prime opportunity for us to give the Amis an even bigger headache. Keep the pressure up on their supply lines, search for and destroy any supply convoys you may find. They will most likely be well protected and small in size. If you don't find any convoys, railway traffic is your secondary priority.\n>
<DeAColD>	<Enemy road traffic is so far conducted without the slightest precautions against air attack, because of their air superiority. Today we will teach them a lesson about arrogance!\n>

<RuBArmR>	<The bombers will attack advancing enemy tanks. Don't allow enemy fighters to intercept them. You are not given ground attack ordnance for this mission, however on your return trip you may descend and attack any soft targets of opportunity with your machine guns.\n>
<RuBArmR>	<The Forts are carpet bombing an SS Panzer Division that's been located in that area. Except very heavy flak over the target, so try to stay well above the bombers to keep out of harm's way. We have limited intelligence on the local enemy air strength, so we can't tell you much about what you will see there except the opposition should not be too heavy. Good luck!\n>
<RuBArmR>	<The B-17s are going to hit some German tanks concentrated in the area. As you can see there are several German airfields within a short flight from the target, so expect a constant progression of small formations of enemy fighters. The Germans favor now attacking the Fortresses from the front in a high-speed pass, so you may want to stay ahead of the bomber stream and intercept Jerries before they can slice through our bombers.\n>
<RuBArmR>	<German Panzers are a huge headache for our boys on the ground, and the B-17s are going to hit a large concentration of enemy tanks that's just been reported in the area. After the bombers drop their bombs, situation permitting you may leave them to come down and strafe some targets of opportunity. \n>

<RuBArmD>	<Our tanks are greatly superior to the laughable Shermans, but they're very vulnerable to air attack. Today you will sweep the skies over a tank columns and attempt to prevent enemy Jabos from operating there.\n>
<RuBArmD>	<Our tanks are constantly attacked from the air. Tank losses reach intolerable levels, so we're ordered to conduct a free hunt over a tank unit and engage any enemy palnes that show up.\n>
<RuBArmD>	<The Panzerwaffe is complaining about lack of air cover. In an example of stupid actionism, now all fighter units are condemned to patrol over individual tank units. Well, maybe we can score some kills today.\n>

<RuAArmR>	<Enemy armor is your primary target. Your search and destroy area is marked on your maps. Actively seek out any German tanks at low altitude, and do not get distracted by other targets unless absolutely necessary.\n>
<RuAArmR>	<Germans are concentrating their tanks in the area, and you'll most likely have the pleasure of fat juicy targets concentrated in small areas.\n>
<RuAArmR>	<A whole damn Panzer division fresh from the Eastern Front is reported to be moving through the area. Let's hope German clean-up crews like barbecue.\n>
<RuAArmR>	<An SS Panzer division equipped with the newest Tiger tanks is threatening to decimate our forces in the area. Remember, with each Tiger you destroy you will be saving the lives of at least two Sherman crews.\n>
<RuAArmR>	<German tanks will be your priority target. While we hold complete air superiority over the whole European Theater, on the ground the Germans with their Tigers and Panthers still have the edge over our tanks. Let's put our air supremacy to good use and deny the Germans any initiative on the ground.\n>
<RuAArmR>	<You'll be concentrating on German tanks. Remember that the armor is very thick on the latest German tanks. Attack them in a dive, strictly from the rear quarter to make sure your rockets and bombs have the chance of killing the tanks. Once all that is gone, use your machine gun ammunition on any targets of opportunity you may find, with priority given to flak guns.\n>

<RuAArmD>	<Since the American tanks are inferior to our own, the safest way for the enemy to destroy them is from the air. Therefore we're ordered to fly patrol over a marching tank unit and protect them from air attacks.\n>
<RuAArmD>	<Our tanks have turned out to be vulnerable against air attack. While they cannot destroy our tanks with their machineguns, the sheer number of bombs and rockets used it simply too much. We have to protect the comrades in the Tanks!\n>
<RuAArmD>	<A Tank unit is moving into position for a local counterattack. It's imperative they are allowed to move forward without being spotted and destroyed from the air. Fly patrol over them and prevent the enemy from stopping our counter attack before it has a chance to begin.\n>
<RuAArmD>	<The comrades from the Panzertruppe have recently suffered heavy losses from the air. In order to stop that you will patrol over a tank unit. The enemy must know by now the column is moving, so expect a sizeable Jabo force to show up. Hopefully they won't expect you to be there, so you can make some easy kills by attacking the heavily loaded Thunderbolts.\n>

<DeBArmD>	<The Jabos will attack advancing enemy tanks. Don't allow enemy fighters to intercept them. You are not given ground attack ordnance for this mission, however if the air opposition is light you may join the Jabos and help them clear the area of softer targets.\n>
<DeBArmD>	<Our Jabos will be bombing a large enemy tank unit that's been located in that area. Except very heavy flak over the target. We have limited intelligence on the local enemy air strength, but rest assured at least some enemy fighters will show up. Hopefully by staying fast and not loitering over the target area for too long you can avoid a large enemy force in the air. Good luck!\n>
<DeBArmD>	<We will escort a strike group hunting for enemy armor on road march. Be careful, this area is known to be patrolled by enemy aircraft. Protect the strike group at all costs!\n>
<DeBArmD>	<A Staffel of Jabos will do some Sherman-hunting today. The guys of that unit had high losses recently and today's strike is all they have left. Don't let them down and protect them.\n>
<DeBArmD>	<American tanks are a huge headache for our troops on the ground, and our Jabos are going to hit a large concentration of enemy tanks that's just been reported in the area. The enemy has not yet organized their air presence in the area, so you should not expect a high number of fighters to intercept today. Good luck!\n>

<DeBArmR>	<There have been a few skirmishes between our tanks and German panzers there yesterday, and knowing the area's importance we're sure the Germans are going to throw additional forces into the fighting. You are to patrol the sector and do your best to help our boys on the ground. Your primary objective is to protect them from the Luftwaffe. Your secondary objective is to make things a little more difficult for the Germans on the ground. Most importantly though, while doing the latter don't forget about the former. I won't be happy if you go around chasing staff cars while the Germans are freely roaming the skies in your sector.\n>
<DeBArmR>	<Today we are protecting our ground forces in the sector marked on your maps. Most of you have done this before, and I have confidence in you boys. Go get us another thank-you letter from a tank commander or two\n>
<DeBArmR>	<We need to protect our armored forces from enemy attacks. You can expect small to medium size groups of German planes, most likely FW-190s flown by bomber pilots. Don't get too happy though as you just might run into some fighter pilots too. Good luck out there, and come back with some kills!\n>

<DeAArmD>	<Our primary target for today is enemy Sherman tanks. Crappy tanks, yes, but there are just too many of them even for the superior German technology to deal with. The Shermans are poorly protected from air attacks, and you may even be able to temporarily knock some out of action with your guns. Good luck!\n>
<DeAArmD>	<We have credible reports of a large enemy tank force moving through there. Locate them and destroy as many of them as you can. Hals- und Beinbruch!\n>
<DeAArmD>	<Your objective today is destruction of enemy armor in that sector. As you can see you will be operating in the immediate vicinity of an Allied airfield housing both Thunderbolts and Mustangs, so make no more than two passes over the target and get out of there. Your experience, and your planes are too valuable to jeopordize for one or two extra Shermans. Good luck!\n>
<DeAArmD>	<Enemy tanks are advancing toward the frontline. There are simply too many of them for our ground troops to knock out, so we have to lend them a hand. Remember to drop your bombs with delayed fuse, or you can die for the Fatherland earlier than you might want!\n>
<DeAArmD>	<The Sherman tanks might not be up to our Panthers or Tigers, but there are just too many of them. Today, we will strike tanks moving up to the front. Go low and hit them hard!\n>
<DeAArmD>	<The Wehrmacht is having a hard time dealing with the sheer numbers of the Shermans opposing them in that sector. Hopefully you can make their lives a little easier by striking these miracles of American ingenuity from the air today. Remember to attack them from the rear in at least a 30-degree dive to maximize your chances of hitting them.\n>

<DeAArmR>	<Your primary objective today is to provide top cover for our advancing Shermans and protect them from any air attacks. Enemy air activity has been heavy recently, and there have been a few cases of the Luftwaffe strafing and bombing our troops. Don't make the mistake of becoming too comfortable. Keep your head on a swivel and be alert at all times!\n>
<DeAArmR>	<You will be supporting our tanks on the ground. While there is a chance of enemy aircraft attacking them, you should also look to help them on the ground and destroy enemy ground units opposing our Shermans\n>
<DeAArmR>	<Our tank crews have enough to worry about with the Tigers and Panthers. They could certainly do very well without the Luftwaffe over their heads. Your main goal for today is to keep the air over our tanks filled with nothing but Allied planes.\n>
<DeAArmR>	<As you probably know our tanks are taking quite a beating on the ground, and in today's situation every single tank is important to the war effort. Do your part and make sure no tanks are destroyed from the air.\n>

<RuBTownR>	<The bombers will be targeting industrial facilities producing parts for the Focke-Wulf fighters. You should also have plenty of chances to see some completed examples during the mission. Return them to the spare parts status.\n>
<RuBTownR>	<The bombers will be hitting a staging area for German troops traveling to the front line, and the nearby warehouses containing weapons and other supplies. It's a high priority target for the Germans, so keep your eyes peeled for enemy fighters and keep our losses down to the minimum.\n>
<RuBTownR>	<The bombers are hitting German troop barracks, which our intelligence indicates are being used to train flak crews. Let's hope they're not ready to graduate yet, as you'll have plenty to worry about from the Luftwaffe planes in the air.\n>
<RuBTownR>	<Targets for today are railroad stations in the city. Protect the bombers.\n>

<RuBTownD>	<The Americans are bombing this town almost daily. Conditions there are terrible and civilian casualties far outnumber any impact on our war machine. Remember, every bomber you shoot down saves many innocent lives on the ground!!\n>
<RuBTownD>	<The Amis are attempting to bomb the city again! Not that there is much to destroy there anymore, but they just keep on coming. Stay together, coordinate your attack and watch out for the escorts! \n>
<RuBTownD>	<The factories there are constantly bombed by the Amis. Today, the bomber stream is likely to return again. I know it takes guts to attack a flying fortress, but it's our duty. Let's get some of these roving murderes today, and avenge the deaths of our women and children on the ground!\n>
<RuBTownD>	<The Americans are returning to this city again. Keep close formation and attack together! And watch out for the escorts! Remember that your best chance to attack a formation of Boeings is to come in from the bomber's 12 or 1 o'clock low position. Good luck!\n>

<DeBTownD>	<The Kampfflieger are making a rare daylight appearance. They are attacking an apparent American headquarters in this town. Expect plenty of flak, and some air opposition too. Good luck!\n>
<DeBTownD>	<Today the Fliegerführer scheduled a massive bombing raid against that town. Just like the old times! Let's show those bastards that we still have the strength to fight, that our beloved Luftwaffe is still the best air force in the world. Make the Americans feel the same terror that our women and children feel every day looking up at the sky!\n>
<DeBTownD>	<The Kampfflieger will be bombing American supply depots there. Our intelligence on the enemy strength in the area is very limited. We will actually rely on you to provide good information on the enemy defences. Note flak positions along the way, and pay close attention to camouflage schemes on any enemy planes you encounter today. Good luck!\n>
<DeBTownD>	<Our bombers will strike a warehouse complex there, and some nearby houses that may be used to house rear echelon troops. Fighter opposition could be heavy, so be careful! Good luck.\n>

<DeBTownR>	<The Germans are bombing this city almost daily. It contains the HQ of an infantry division, and it is an important staging point for their operations. A lot of GIs come and go through the town, and many of them are killed before they ever see the front lines. You'll be protecting the city airspace today. The chance of seeing the Luftwaffe is very high.\n>
<DeBTownR>	<Lately there has been a lot of talk of new types of German fighters seen over this sector here. B-17s report fast-moving unidentified specs out in the distance. Your primary objective is to protect the airspace over the city from the Luftwaffe. However the HQ takes these reports so seriously that your secondary objective today is to investigate any unidentified fighters seen in your sector. Take some shots with your gun camera if you can. Hopefully that'll be in addition to the regular German planes you shoot down today. Good luck.\n>
<DeBTownR>	<We've just received reports of a German bomber force converging on the town. Take-off immediately, you can most likely make it there in time to still prevent some bombs from falling on the heads of our troops.\n>

<RuBAFR>	<The bombers will be hitting an airfield. It's a high priority target for the Germans, so you can expect serious opposition this time.\n>
<RuBAFR>	<Enemy air opposition is expected to be light. A German air base is the primary target today. After the bombers drop their load, swoop down and clean up the base of anything that remains.\n>
<RuBAFR>	<The bombers will be bombing the airfield where the famed JG26 is reportedly located. You can rest assured the Germans won't like that. In the likely event of heavy German presence in the air, stay with the bombers at all times. If the opposition is lighter than expected, flight leaders may decide to descend and strafe the airfield.\n>

<RuBAFD>	<This airfield has been carpet bombed twice just this week. The runway surface is easy to repair, but we're running out of places to hide our planes, and we can't afford to have any more of them destroyed on the ground. Patrol the most likely approach path for the bombers, and get at least some of them before they get through!\n>
<RuBAFD>	<This airfield has suffered repeated bombing raids recently. We have to try to break up any further bombing attempts. Remember to keep your speed up at all times! No sudden maneuvres, no slowing down for easier aiming! Spray the bomber stream like in the training films you've watched, attack in formation and your combined firepower should bring down some bombers. Good luck!\n>
<RuBAFD>	<We are going to patrol over the airfield there. The Americans have not attacked it for some time, so it's only natural that they should hit it today. We will give them a hot reception!\n>

<RuAAFR>	<Your target is the enemy airfield. It's one of a few Luftwaffe bases still operational in our area. You can of course expect heavy flak greeting you on the way there, so be alert and come home safe.\n>
<RuAAFR>	<We're hitting the Luftwaffe base in the area. Intelligence suggest you will find a mix of all sorts of planes parked around there, anything from obsolete bombers to the newest model fighters. No enemy opposition is expected, so take as long as you need to wipe them all out.\n>
<RuAAFR>	<Your primary target is the Luftwaffe airfield marked on your map. Heavy flak is expected, so locate and destroy all the guns first, and then take your sweet time with the parked planes. \n>

<DeBAFD>	<Today, a strike group will attack an enemy airfield. Extremely heavy flak and fighter opposition is to be expected at the target. Be extra careful and try to make some strafing runs on the flak positions if the situation allows it.\n>
<DeBAFD>	<In retaliation for our recent aircraft losses on the ground we are striking enemy airfields. Your target is reportedly the largest Jabos airfield in the area. Our bombers will need a heavy escort if they are to survive this one. So do your best to protect them from the air, and if there aren't too many Mustangs bothering you, make the lives even easier for the Jabos by attacking enemy flak positions. Good luck!\n>
<DeBAFD>	<Today, a group of our bombers will attack an enemy airfield. This is going to be a hornet's nest, so be prepared for the worst. Be extremely careful, keep your head on a swivel and remember that protecting the bombers is more important than scoring kills.\n>

<DeBAFR>	<Our mission today is of the highest importance. We're protecting our airfields. As most of you know, it's much easier to destroy a plane on the ground than in the air. Since nowadays the majority of Luftwaffe pilots are too poorly trained to shoot down a plane in the air, attacking our planes on the ground is their best chance of countering our air superiority. Don't take this the wrong way though and stay sharp! There are still plenty of good German pilots out there, so respect the enemy up until the moment you blow him up. Good luck.\n>
<DeBAFR>	<I know many of you are getting tired of ground attack and escort missions, and today you're finally getting a chance to meet the Luftwaffe in the air on your own terms. Our airfields here are of course a top priority target for the Krauts. They think they can score a few easy points by destroying our planes on the ground. But we're going to turn tables on them and meet them in the air in force, shooting them down before they ever have a chance to drop their bombs. Now go out there and score some kills gentlemen!\n>
<DeBAFR>	<As most of you who were not on furlough yesterday are aware, our airfield got a visit from a some brave little Kraut last night. He buzzed the field in his Focke Wulf, and apparently visited a couple of other bases in the area as well. We assume he was doing recon, and therefore expect a few more visits from the Luftwaffe today. You are to take off immediately and protect the airspace in the sector marked on your maps, especially focusing on this airfield here. Try to make sure we still have something to land on when your fuel runs out gentlemen.\n>

Try to make sure we still have something to land on when your fuel runs out gentlemen.\n>

<DeAAFD>	<It is payback time! Your target is the enemy airfield. It's one of the main American fighter bases operational in our area. You can of course expect heavy flak greeting you on the way there, so be alert at all times. Hit the flak positions first, then concentrated on parked planes and fuel dumps.\n>
<DeAAFD>	<We're hitting the American air base in the area! Aerial reconnaisance suggests that you will find a mix of all sorts of planes parked around there, anything from transport planes to Thunderbolts and Mustangs. Parked fighters are your primary target, with the second priority given to airfield infrastructure such as ATC towers and fuel dumps.\n>
<DeAAFD>	<Your primary target is the American airfield marked on your map. Heavy flak is expected, so locate and destroy all the guns first, and then take your time with the parked planes. \n>
<DeAAFD>	<Today we have an extraordinary mission: We will attack an enemy airfield! Flak and fighter opposition is going to be heavy, but we have to hit our target hard. Attack Flak emplacements first, then go for parked aircraft.\n>

<RuBBridgeR>	<The bombers' primary target for today is the important bridge used to transfer supplies to the front. After the bombers drop their bombs asses the situation in the air. If the bombers are not actively engaged by the Luftwaffe, drop down and search for targets of opportunity in the area. Good luck!\n>
<RuBBridgeR>	<The bombers will be hitting a very important bridge. Our recon flight that photographed it early this morning noticed a flight of four Focke-Wulf 190's near the bridge, so we have to assume the Germans are aware of its importance and have a standing patrol over it. Stay close to the bombers, and be in a position to respond to a high-speed attack from the front which will most likely be mounted. Good luck!\n>
<RuBBridgeR>	<The primary target for the bombers is this bridge right here. Most other bridges in the area are already out of action, so you will quite possibly encounter a lot of traffic going through the bridge. Its destruction should create a giant traffic jam, and present you with plenty of targets of opportunity stretching from the bridge Westwards. Good luck gentlemen!\n>

<RuBBridgeD>	<The enemy is likely to bomb this bridge, because it is a vital crossing point for our supply system. If the enemy attacks, watch out for the escort, but target bombers!\n>
<RuBBridgeD>	<The Americans have tried to bomb this bridge unsuccessfully yesterday. It is likely they will try again. We will be waiting for them!\n>
<RuBBridgeD>	<Bridges in the area are essential for success of our operations. Destroy any USAAF bomber that you see!\n>

<DeBBridgeR>	<In their desperate attempts to halt our advance, the Germans are understandably allocating all their available forces to denying us the means to continue to attack. One of the easiest things they can do now is to attack bridges. A single bomb dropped during a single sortie can seriously affect the supply situation, and therefore hamper our war efforts in a large sector for several days. You are therefore tasked with defending the bridges in the sector marked on your maps. Don't let the Germans destroy them.\n>
<DeBBridgeR>	<As most of the Western Europe is covered with a fine net of small rivers, bridges are extremely important to our war effort. Every single bridge is both a tactical and a strategic target for the Germans. Today you will be keeping the airspace over the sector marked on your maps clear of the German air force. Don't let the Krauts get through. Good luck.\n>
<DeBBridgeR>	<All bridges in this sector are of vital importance to everyone fighting there, both on the ground and in the air. The Germans have been launching sporadic raids all this week, and occasionally scoring good hits on the bridges here. So, unless you want the whole Corps of Engineers hating you, go out there and protect our bridges from the Luftwaffe.\n>

<DeBBridgeD>	<The Americans have managed to repair this bridge surprisingly fast. Our bombers are going to destroy it again and we fly escort!\n>
<DeBBridgeD>	<In order to interdict the enemy supply system, our bombers will attack this bridge. Since the enemy knows of its importance, fighter opposition is likely. Good luck!\n>
<DeBBridgeD>	<This key bridge will be hit by our bombers today. In face of enemy airpower, they need strong escort. Our task is to get the bombers there and back again safely!.\n>

<RuABridgeR>	<You'll be hitting the bridge marked on your map. It's located on a major route which the Germans use to throw their reinforcements at the front. By destroying the bridge you can make their logistics ever so difficult, and possibly delay the arrival of whole divisions to the front line for several crucial days.\n>
<RuABridgeR>	<Your target is the bridge marked on your map. After dropping your bombs, stay low and aggressively hunt any rail or highway traffic in the area.\n>
<RuABridgeR>	<You have to destroy the bridge marked on your map. It's absolutely crucial to the supply situation as it will effectively split the German forces in two, leaving a large chunk of their forward units without resupply for up to several days.\n>

<RuABridgeD>	<The bridge there has been attacked constantly for the past several days. It's destroyed again as soon as it's repaired, and the back roads are becoming jammed for many kilometers. Keep harassing the bombers all the way from their IP to target, make it more difficult for them to aim accurately. Good luck! \n>
<RuABridgeD>	<This bridge is absolutely vital for the supplies of the front in that region. It must be protected at all costs! We expect a sizeable enemy force to arrive there within a short while, so be prepared for a hard fight. Good luck Kameraden!\n>
<RuABridgeD>	<The bridge there has already been attacked twice in the last five days. This time we will protect it from further damage! Watch out for the escorts and single out bomb carrying aircraft.\n>

<DeABridgeR>	<Our bombers have destroyed most of the bridges in the area before our advance, so all the bridges that are left intact became red hot real estate. Patrol the bridges in your sector and make sure the Krauts can't get to them.\n>
<DeABridgeR>	<The enemy's been trying to hit this bridge for several days now. It's one of the few bridges left still intact in the area, so we must protect it at all costs.\n>
<DeABridgeR>	<Bridges in this sector are crucial for our supply operations. Krauts know this, and that's why they've been sending aircraft out to bomb them almost daily. We don't expect them to stop today, so keep your eyes peeled and stop the Germans before they have a chance to hit the bridge.\n>

<DeABridgeD>	<This bridge fell into enemy hands intact. It's located on a major route which the Americans can use to moutn a major offensive. By destroying the bridge you can make their lives a little harder, and hopefully allow our troops in the back to fortify the positions enough to make any further advances impossible.\n>
<DeABridgeD>	<Your target is the bridge marked on your map. It's absolutely crucial to the supply situation as it will effectively split the American forces in two, leaving a large chunk of their forward units without resupply for up to several days.\n>
<DeABridgeD>	<Our retreating forces blew up that bridge, but apparently the enemy has repaired it. We have to blow it up again. Be on the lookout for fighters, and watch our for flak! Hals- und Beinbruch!\n>

<RuParaR>	<That is all, good luck!\n>
<RuParaD>	<We will fly free hunt there. Destroy any American plane that you see.\n>
<DeParaR>	<We have very little idea of the actual enemy strength you might encounter in the area. We do believe however we're sending enough planes to counter anything the Luftwaffe might put up in the air.\n>
<DeParaD>	<Our Fallschirmjäger are making a small scale raid on that objective. Protect them from fighters!\n>

<RuReconR>	<That is all, good luck!\n>
<RuReconD>	<We fly free hunt there, be ready to destroy any American plane that you see.\n>
<DeReconR>	<Again, we're facing hectic resistance from the Luftwaffe. You might encounter anything from a single high-speed recon plane to a considerable fighter-bomber force, possibly also protected by fighters. Even if you do meet a large number of enemy planes, remember - you have better planes and far superior training. Good luck to all of you!\n>
<DeReconD>	<A reconnaissance plane is conducting a flight over that target. During recent days, we lost too many planes on such missions, so this one will be escorted by us.\n>

<RuDeAirRD>	<The main goal for today is control over city's airspace. We have very little idea of the actual enemy strength you might encounter in the area. We do believe however we're sending enough planes to counter anything the enemy might put up in the air.\n>
<RuDeAirRD>	<Your task for today is simple: keep the enemy planes out of that airspace. Good visibility is reported at your assigned altitude, so stay fast and do some damage today.\n>
<RuDeAirRD>	<This area is just one of several high profile targets the enemy may attack, but considering their activity from the past several days I think your chances of seeing enemy planes are pretty high. However whether they'll be fighters, Jabos or bombers is anyone's guess. Good luck!\n>
<RuDeAirRD>	<You are to patrol your assigned airspace and make sure the enemy can't get through to attack targets below or behind you. Good luck today!\n>
<RuDeAirRD>	<We're facing hectic activity from the enemy. You might encounter anything from a single high-speed recon plane to a considerable fighter-bomber force protected by fighters. Even if you do meet a large number of enemy planes, remember - you have better planes and far superior training. Good luck to all of you!\n>

<RuBalloon>	<A German observation balloon is directing enemy artillery fire in this sector. If we could destroy it, the effectiveness of enemy artillery would be severely weakened. Locate it and shoot it down!\n>
<DeBalloon>	<A balloon is guiding the fire of our artillery in this sector. The Americans have surely spotted it and will most likely try to shoot it down. Patrol over the balloon and intercept any American fighter trying to attack it.\n>

<DeACE_KILLED> <German radio reported that a well-known ace %s was killed in action today. We believe he was shot down during this engagement.\n>
<RuACE_KILLED> <Our intelligence reports that some quite famous American Pilot named %s was killed in this combat.\n>
<RuACE_KILLED> <Last mission, you shot down %s according to radio messages deciphered. He was a very experienced pilot and his loss is hurting morale.\n>
<DeACE_CAPTURED> <We are in the process of interrogating %s, a well-known German ace who was picked up by our troops earlier today. He was apparently shot down by our squadron\n>
<RuACE_CAPTURED> <Our troops have captured %s, who claims to be a famous ace and wants to meet you.\n>
<DeACE_DOWN> <Based on the markings described in the engagement reports filed by our squadron, HQ believes %s, a well-known German ace, was shot down today. His status remains unknown.\n>
<RuACE_DOWN> <A guy called %s, apparently one of their experts, was shot down in this combat, He escaped alive but you certainly made him crap his pants.\n>

<RuAArtyR>	<Today we're targeting enemy artillery positions. We've had it on our list for a few days now but had to deal with higher priority assignments. In the meantime the German guns have been causing a lot of headache to our troops on the ground. Be careful, as the Germans often use their 88s as artillery guns. We have no information on these guns; quite possibly they may end up firing at you too. Good luck!\n>
<RuAArtyD>	<Our artillery battery there is causing heavy losses among enemy troops. It is likely that the enemy have already located it and they will certainly send over some Jabos to deal with it. We will patrol over the area in case of any enemy attacks.\n>
<DeAArtyR>	<Our artillery in that area is under almost constant air attack. They have to relocate after firing almost every shell. You are ordered to patrol the area and order to intercept any potential attackers. Good luck!\n>
<DeAArtyD>	<This enemy artillery battery there is causing our ground troops much trouble. They want it destroyed and we've got the job. Artillery guns are your primary target, then everything else.\n>
<RuBArtyR>	<The bombers are hitting German artillery positions. Ground troops have tried to take those out of action a few times, but the guns are well behind the German lines and they keep moving back by the time our boys fight their way through. A few hundred men died trying to get those guns. So cook those Krauts extra crispy today, they've really earned it.\n>
<RuBArtyD>	<The artillery there has an excellent shooting field far behind the enemy lines. Because of that, the enemy bombs them often. Today, we will intercept such a raid and tell them a lesson or two!\n>
<DeBArtyR>	<Yesterday an artillery position in the area was attacked by Focke-Wulfs, and we've lost four guns and almost fifty men. This is not the first time the Germans go for our guns. The area where that happened is right on the border between our and RAF's sectors so it's been receiving less air coverage than others. Germans must have noticed that. You will patrol the area today, and hopefully you'll meet some Germans.\n>
<DeBArtyD>	<Our Jabos will be hitting Allied artillery positions. The guns are well behind the front lines and they keep moving with the front line, staying out of reach our our forces. A few hundred men died just yesterday in the morning artillery barrage. So cook those Amis extra crispy today, they've really earned it.\n>

<RuARailR>	<We're hitting a German rail yard. It will be a very target rich environment. You will see plenty of rail cars to strafe, there will be flak guns protecting the area, and the chance of the Luftwaffe coming up to meet you is also very high. Be cautious gentlemen, and God be with you. I hope to see all of you back here safely tonight.\n>
<RuARailD>	<The Americans are bombing this city almost daily. I want everybody to be very careful out there and make a good attack on the bombers. Remember, it is our duty to make them pay for every bomb they drop on our cities.\n>
<DeARailR>	<The Krauts are mounting a concentrated effort aimed at our supply lines. In the past few days they've hit almost every major rail yard in the area, except for this one. This makes it easy for us to predict their next move. Patrol the area, and you'll almost certainly meet some German fighter-bombers coming your way. Good luck!\n>
<DeARailD>	<Today we will attack a major target: the railway station which is very important for the enemy's supply system. Heavy flak as well as fighters are to be expected. Be careful, and come home alive!\n>
<RuBRailR>	<The 17s are hitting a German rail junction. It's a major supply point for their troops stationed in the area. You can expect heavy Luftwaffe presence in the air, and probably more flak than you're used to. Stick to the bombers like glue. Attack the Germans in a dive, scare them off and return right back up to your position. Absolutely no dogfights! If I see any fancy maneuvering on anyone's gun camera I'll him you demoted to Private and recommend to star in the next VD Awareness film.\n>
<RuBRailD>	<The city is often bombed because it contains several important industrial targets. The Americans and especially the British at night often miss, and civilian casualties are high. Today, the Americans will try again and we will intercept! Keep an eye on the escorts, but your main objective as always is to destroy a bomber, at all costs!\n>
<DeBRailR>	<We are told to expect a Luftwaffe raid on the rail station there in the latest intelligence report we've just received. While in the past they've redefined the meaning of the word "intelligence" on multiple occasions, we still have to follow through with this report. Patrol the city airspace, and intercept any German planes you see.\n>
<DeBRailD>	<Our bomber pilots will make another rare day appearance and attack this railway station. Please keep them safe, and watch out for each other too.\n>

<RuADepotR>	<We're going to hit what intelligence believes to be a supply depot. What kind of supplies are stored there we are not told. In any case, light flak and no air opposition is expected. So go out there, drop your bombs on target so you don't have to go back there again, and get one mission closer to going home. Best of luck everyone.\n>
<RuADepotD>	<Another raid on this city, apparently. We will scramble to intercept these American sky bandits. Keep on attacking until you run out of ammo and try to avoid the escort fighters, if at all possible!\n>
<DeADepotR>	<Your priority target there is our supply depot. It's pretty much in the only warehouse complex in a very large area, so even Germans must eventually figure out we use it for storage. Patrol the area, destroy any Luftwaffe planes you see.\n>
<DeADepotD>	<Target for today is American supply depot. A very important target, so heavy resistance is to be expected, both from Flak and fighters. I expect some hits, Kameraden!\n>
<RuBDepotR>	<The 17s are going to bomb a major supply depot there. The losses the bombers suffered the last time we did an escort were absolutely unacceptable. Gentlemen, please remember that there are 10 men in every bomber. Every time you let a German get through to the bombers, you put at least 10 human lives at risk. You are the only hope of staying alive for those men! Do your best to get them home safe time.\n>
<RuBDepotD>	<The supply depot there is attracting enemy bombers like a magnet. At least some opportunity for us to shoot them down, I guess. Good luck!\n>
<DeBDepotR>	<The HQ decided to direct our efforts at protecting the supply depots in our rear. There is a rather high chance of a small-scale German strike in this sector, and by patrolling this area you'll be covering both our troop concentrations and the supply depots. Make sure you stay low enough for our flak to see your markings, or high enough for them to miss you. Stay focused, stay sharp! Score some kills gentlemen. Good luck.\n>
<DeBDepotD>	<Our bombers are striking the depot there. Since fighters are to be expected, we will fly escort.\n>

<RuAPortR>	<We will be attacking a German naval base. It's used by both civilian and military vessels, but mostly for the military purpose. Your primary targets will be any ships you can find, and the warehouse structures marked on your maps. Good luck!\n>
<RuAPortD>	<This port is an important base for our S-Boats and Midget submarines which conduct attacks on the invasion fleet. They have to be protected!\n>
<DeAPortR>	<For reasons I should not explain, our ports in the area are extremely important. The Germans can be seen flying over them almost daily. There are hundreds of men in those ports who directly rely on you to protect them, and tens of thousands of men in the field who need these ports to stay in the fight. Protect our ports gentlemen!\n>
<DeAPortD>	<Today we will try to attack one of the ports the enemy invasion fleet is using! This will be a dangerous mission. Lets try to get in, cause some damage and get out again very fast\n>
<RuBPortR>	<The bombers are hitting a German naval base. It's used by both civilian and military vessels, but mostly for the military purpose. You can expect heavy Luftwaffe presence in the air, and medium to heavy flak throughout the target area. Stay with the bombers and only engage the Germans that come in to attack. Good luck to all of you!\n>
<RuBPortD>	<The port there has been bombed ten times the last two days. so far damage has been limited, but we wont be that lucky forever. So we will try to intercept the next raid.\n>
<DeBPortR>	<For reasons I should not explain, our ports in the area are extremely important. The Germans can be seen flying over them almost daily. There are hundreds of men in those ports who directly rely on you to protect them, and tens of thousands of men in the field who need these ports to stay in the fight. Protect our ports gentlemen!\n>
<DeBPortD>	<The bombers are attempting to strike the ports of the enemy invasion fleet. We will escort them into that mess. Good luck!\n>

<RuAHQR>	<We have very reliable intelligence that a German field HQ was just set up there! It's a rare opportunity for us to strike the beast at the head. Stay in the area for as long as you have to, and wipe it all clean. Germans should not expect us so soon, and you should have a very high chance of killing some important officers and even generals. Do your best, really let them have it this time gentlemen! Good luck all of you.\n>
<RuAHQD>	<Apparently an American reconnaissance plane has discovered our field HQ there. While it is being evacuated, we will protect it.\n>
<DeAHQR>	<We're protecting the highest priority target today, an army field HQ. I can't mention the name of the four-star general who is working from there, but suffice it to say that if he is killed Hitler will personally drive to your barracks and kiss each one of you on the lips. Take this one very seriously gentlemen, this is probably the most important mission of your career. If you fail, your names will be listed in every history book for years to come. Annihilate any German plane that comes anywhere near the HQ.\n>
<DeAHQD>	<Our intelligence indicated the hectic ground activity there indicates an enemy Field HQ! A nice opportunity to cause some real damage! Be careful and watch out for fighters!\n>
<RuBHQR>	<The bombers are attacking a German field HQ. Light to none air opposition is expected, but flak should be heavy. If no Luftwaffe planes are seen after the bombers drop their eggs, feel free to leave them and clean up after them.\n>
<RuBHQD>	<Enemy reconnaissance has discovered our field headquarters in this area. We must protect it while it is being evacuated. Shoot down any enemy plane in the vicinity!\n>
<DeBHQR>	<You are protecting the airspace over the field HQ of an army intelligence unit. It's just relocated there, so chances of Germans deliberately targeting it are rather slim. However there is always a possibility of a German plane finding it by chance - and that's the possibility we should not allow to happen. Protect the field HQ and destroy any German planes you see.\n>
<DeBHQD>	<The bombers will be striking a prime target: the enemy field headquarters for this area! Since it is most likely well defended we will provide escort.\n>

<RuATroopR>	<Today we're going to do some real in your face fighting, real personal stuff. We're hitting German troop concentrations located in an open field. The troops stationed in the area is believe to be an SS division, all veterans from the Russian front. suppress any AAA first, and then you'll have plenty of chances to see the exact effects of .50 cals and bombs on a human body.\n>
<RuATroopD>	<A Panzer battalion has moved into position for a counterattack. The Americans will most likely attack the tanks before they can move. We will fly free hunt over their positions and intercept any enemy bomber.\n>
<DeATroopR>	<With the shortage of intact buildings in the area, a lot of our ground troops have to be stationed out in the fields. These locations become easy targets for the Luftwaffe. You'll patrol one such location today. The boys there have been bombed and strafed twice very recently, and it's really affecting morale. The sight of you flying overhead should really help them, both body and soul.\n>
<DeATroopD>	<Recon has discovered an American tank unit ready for an attack. We will strike them before they can move!\n>
<RuBTroopR>	<The bombers are carpet bombing a large area where German troops arriving from the rear are being processed and assembled. Stay with the bombers up until they drop their bombs, and then make a judgment call whether it is safe to leave them and come down to hurt the German some more. Good luck everyone, today's mission should be easier than the last.\n>
<RuBTroopD>	<The assembly point of a tank unit has been under air attack for some days. The frontline commanders demand air cover, otherwise they cannot launch counterattacks. So we will fly free hunt over their positions. Good Luck!\n>
<DeBTroopR>	<With the shortage of intact buildings in the area, a lot of our ground troops have to be stationed out in the fields. These locations become easy targets for the Luftwaffe. You'll patrol one such location today. The boys there have been bombed and strafed twice very recently, and it's really affecting morale. The sight of you flying overhead should really help them, both body and soul.\n>
<DeBTroopD>	<Our bombers are attacking an enemy assembly point. We will cover them. Take care of the bombers and watch out for enemy fighters. It is most important that the bombers make their run unmolested..\n>

<dbrDeEXCELLENT>	<Great Job, Kamerad. You set an example for the rest of the unit. Carry on like this and you will get a medal!>
<dbrDeEXCELLENT>	<A job well done. You prove to be one of the Gruppe's best pilots once again. You are an example for all pilots of our unit.>
<dbrDeEXCELLENT>	<The Fliegerführer just congratulated to this superb mission. If only all our missions would be so successful!>
<dbrDeGOOD>	<Your performance in this mission was good. We need more pilots like you.>
<dbrDeGOOD>	<Good show, you're becoming a really good pilot.>
<dbrDeGOOD>	<Good work! The Kommodore is very pleased with your actions.>
<dbrDeGOOD>	<You've done well. In those times, Germany could need more pilots like you.>
<dbrDeOK>	<Another mission accomplished. Now get some rest, tomorrow will be another busy day.>
<dbrDeOK>	<You completed yet another mission! It seems you're getting quite good at this.>
<dbrDeOK>	<A mission like many others. Maybe we'll have more excitement tomorrow.>
<dbrDeBAD>	<It was definitely not your best day, but at least you've survived.>
<dbrDeBAD>	<At least you survived, even if it was a missions gone horribly wrong.>
<dbrDeBAD>	<They pulled us through the grinder, but at least you've survived and can fight again.>

<dbrDeEXCELLENT(L)>	<Great Job, Kamerad. You set an example for the rest of the unit by fighting successfully while your comrades died around you. That's fighting spirit!>
<dbrDeEXCELLENT(L)>	<Despite great odds, you did a very good job. However, too many of our comrades failed to return.>
<dbrDeEXCELLENT(L)>	<The Wehrmacht report will mention your fine performance in this mission! What it won't mention are our heavy losses...>
<dbrDeGOOD(L)>	<Your performance in this mission was good, though as a whole, it was another disaster for us..>
<dbrDeGOOD(L)>	<Good show, you're becoming a really good pilot. You're apparently luckier than most of your comrades who didnt make it back..>
<dbrDeGOOD(L)>	<Good work! The Kommodore is very pleased with your actions but worried about the losses the Staffel took.>
<dbrDeGOOD(L)>	<You've done well, even in spite of the Staffel's heavy losses. In those times, Germany could need more pilots like you.>
<dbrDeOK(L)>	<We suffered heavily, yet accomplished our mission. You remaining pilots have to be ready for another mission tomorrow.>
<dbrDeOK(L)>	<After landing you suddenly realize how many great comrades you have lost this mission, a sad day for the Staffel.>
<dbrDeOK(L)>	<Last mission brought heavy losses again, as often during recent days. The air war is not what it used to be.>
<dbrDeBAD(L)>	<That was a disaster! We took heavy losses and archieved little. The Staffel is almost anihilated.>
<dbrDeBAD(L)>	<The staffel has been anihilated for little gain. You're one of the few survivors. It's your second birthday today.>
<dbrDeBAD(L)>	<They pulled us through the grinder, you can be lucky you returned alive! Many of your Kameraden didnt.>

<dbrDeEXCELLENT(V)>	<Great Job, Kamerad. You set an example for the rest of the unit. Carry on like this and you will get a medal!>
<dbrDeEXCELLENT(V)>	<A job well done. You prove to be one of the Gruppe's best pilots once again. You are an example for all pilots of our unit.>
<dbrDeEXCELLENT(V)>	<The Fliegerführer just congratulated to this superb mission. If only all our missions would be so successful!>
<dbrDeGOOD(V)>	<Your performance in this mission was good. We need more pilots like you.>
<dbrDeGOOD(V)>	<Good show, you're becoming a really good pilot. You right into that great unit.>
<dbrDeGOOD(V)>	<Good work! The Kommodore is very pleased with the actions of the Staffel.>
<dbrDeGOOD(V)>	<You've done well. In those times, Germany could need more pilots like you and your Comrades.>
<dbrDeOK(V)>	<Another mission accomplished. Now get some rest, tomorrow will be another busy day.>
<dbrDeOK(V)>	<You completed yet another mission, it seems your getting quite good at this..>
<dbrDeOK(V)>	<A mission like many others. Maybe we'll have more excitement tomorrow.>
<dbrDeBAD(V)>	<It was definitely not your best day. At least the Staffel came off quite good today.>
<dbrDeBAD(V)>	<At least you survived. Ask your fellow pilots how to fight successfully, they can teach you a lot. They did very well today.>
<dbrDeBAD(V)>	<Despite your screwing up, the Staffel did well today .>

<dbrDeEXCELLENT(A)>	<Great Job, Kameraden!. Carry on like this and you all will get a medal! And maybe even some leave...>
<dbrDeEXCELLENT(A)>	<The Wehrmacht report just mentioned our last fight! We can be really proud of our archievement!.>
<dbrDeEXCELLENT(A)>	<The Fliegerführer just congratulated to this superb mission. Unfortunately he's likely to expect such performance every time now...>
<dbrDeGOOD(A)>	<The Staffel really showed the Amis that we can still fight! You fit right into this great team we have!>
<dbrDeGOOD(A)>	<Good show, you're becoming a really good pilot. But dont get too cocky. We need team players here if we all want to survive!>
<dbrDeGOOD(A)>	<Good work! The Kommodore is very pleased with your actions. He's sending a few bottles of whine we "salvaged" during retreat>
<dbrDeGOOD(A)>	<You've done well. A war correspondent is waiting at the CP to interview the heroic fighter pilots. Please only drink after you told him your story!>
<dbrDeOK(A)>	<Another mission accomplished. In these times, such streaks of luck are getting rare>
<dbrDeOK(A)>	<You completed yet another mission, it seems your getting quite good at this. Maybe there's still hope.>
<dbrDeOK(A)>	<A mission like many others. If we carry on like this, we will maybe even get through this mess.>
<dbrDeBAD(A)>	<It was definitely not your best day. But at least you and your Combrades survived this one.>
<dbrDeBAD(A)>	<At least everybody survived. But now get some rest, we will have to try again tomorrow.>
<dbrDeBAD(A)>	<Der Adler wont write Articles about this one, I'm afraide.>

<BeforeDDayUsBr> <After almost two years of planning, the invasion of Europe will begin soon. In order to prepare for the invasion our Air Force will attack targets in the rear area of potential invasion areas. Main objectives are communications and logistics of the German troops based in France. Another goal is to weaken the Luftwaffe forces in France.>
<BeforeDDayUsDb> <The 8th Air Force has flown numerous raids on targets in Normandy and around Calais, severely weakening the German supply network in France. Even more important, these raids were a good chance for our pilots to gain experience. Also, the intensified raids have prompted the Germans to weaken their home defense units in favor of basing more planes in France.>
<France44DeBr> <It is quite obvious that the enemy will invade soon. It is not entirely clear where this invasion will take place, but the Americans and British are stepping up their air campaign against targets in France. The Luftwaffe will try to defend military targets in France but has to conserve its strength for the invasion>
<France44DeDb> <The invasion has begun! Enemy troops have landed at serveral places in the Normandy. All available Luftwaffe forces will transfer to France to repel the invasion!>
<NormandyUsBr> <Operation Overlord, the Invasion of France, has begun! After joining up the five beaches and establishing a firm bridgehead covering 50 miles along the Channel coastline, we continue our offensive. Whilst the British strike in the Caen direction, drawing the German tank divisions around the regional capital, our forces broke out from Utah towards Barneville to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula. Your unit is one of the first of the 9th AAF and 2nd allied TAF to be based on an advanced landing ground in Normandy. Your main task is to fly tactical support for the troops and defend the invasion ports and troops from German raids. Heavy Luftwaffe resistance is to be expected.>
<NormandyUsDb> <After being stuck in the Bocage for several weeks, US troops finally broke out during Operation Cobra. After failed German counterattacks at Mortain, General Patton's enveloping maneuver caught the German forces in Normandy in a huge pocket near Falaise. Tactical airpower helped to reduce this pocket to rubble, and even if hundreds of thousands of German soldiers escaped, their entire equipment and weapons were lost. The German army is in full retreat all across France and Paris is due to be liberated soon. Tactical airpower had a huge part in this success. The allied tactical air forces managed to almost annihilate the Luftwaffe over Normandy. Even more important was constant close support for our advancing troops, which proved instrumental for the successful Falaise operation.>
<NormandyDeBr> <A few days ago, the British and Americans invaded France in Normandy. All available Luftwaffe fighter units have been ordered to hastily transfer to grass strips in France and are now under command of Luftflotte 2. Our main tasks will be air cover for German troops in France and attacks against enemy troops. The enemy air force is numerically very superior and the hasty transfer and lack of coordination has already resulted in heavy equipment losses. Nethertheless, we must do our duty.>
<NormandyDeDb> <The enemy air superiority proved too much for Luftflotte 2. Constant attacks on our airfields and lopsided air combat against much stronger enemies have led to catastrophic losses with our fighter units. The bombers were even worse off: They were mostly totally annihilated. Without air cover, our troops were not able to contain the enemy beachhad. Much of our armored forces were caught in a huge annihilation battle near Falaise and lost all their vehicles. The Wehrmacht is abandoning France and will try to make a stand at the German border. The shattered units of Luftflotte 2 will be rebuilt and used for home defense. The planes maybe replaceable, but we have lost many experienced pilots as well, which are impossible to replace.>

<BerlinAir44UsBr> <Simultanously with the invasion, the strategic air raids against German industrial targets continued in full force. The 8th AAF is still raiding targets around Berlin, and due to losses over France, Luftwaffe opposition has become much weaker than in Spring. However, bombing Berlin is still no Milk run and the fighter units of the 8th AAF still have to escort the Fortresses. During your tour, you will fly strategic escort missions deep into Germany.>
<BerlinAir44UsDb> <Congratulations, you completed your tour of Duty with the 8th! While German fighter opposition got stronger again in Fall of 1944, the quality of German pilots is obviously lower than before. Better US escort tactics and poor weather have also helped to ensure the 8th's success in the bombing of industrial targets. But still, our losses were severe, especially in bombers. While the Germans have apparently developed new rocket and jet fighters far superior to any other plane, they have so far failed to use them in an effective way.>
<BerlinAir44DeBr> <After the blood bath of Normandy, most fighter units have been rebuild using newly trained pilots with little flying experience or by disbanding bomber and transport units. These fighter units will now be used in the Reichsluftverteidigung, defending Germany against the American daylight raids. While intercepting such a raid was already tough in Spring, it became even tougher now with more and improved enemy Mustang fighters and even greater numbers of bombers. We must rely und good coordination and tactics in order to be successful.>
<BerlinAir44DeDb> <The fall battles over Berlin turned into the largest and bloodiest air battles ever fought. Our losses were horrible, especially among the new pilts, but still many enemy bombers were shot down. The air war over Germany is turning into a war of attrition, but it is dubvious that we can win such a war. We need new and superior weapons in order to win back air superiority over Germany. Such weapons are in development, but we have to old the line with what we have until they are ready.>
<BalatonAir44UsBr> <After Rumania changed sides in August 1945, the 15th AAF had to change objectives. Based on the huge airbase in Foggia on the italian adriatic coast, it will now strike Germany and Hungary, its only remaining ally from the south. Important targets are German industry in Austria but also the Capital of Hungary, Budapest. The hungarian Ruler, Admiral Horthy, is considering a seperate peace with the allies and bombing Hungary may reinforce his will for peace. The fighter units of the 15th AAF, now mostly equipped with Mustangs instead of Lightnings, will escort the 15th's Bombers to Hungary. Heavy resistance from German and hungarian air forces is likely.>
<BalatonAir44UsDb> <In November 1944, a group of pro German officers staged a coup against Horthy, ruining any chance of a seperate peace with Hungary. Even though the Germans have occupied the country, the hungarian military continues fighting. This leaves no other way than letting the Russians occupy that country. The 15th AAF has performed well, though, carrying out bombing raids against heavy resistance.>
<BalatonAir44DeBr> <American bombers based in Italy have started to raid Budapest. Since there is not much important industry, it is most likely a moral bombing in order to drive our last ally out of the war. However, the hungarian military is firmly at our side and a joint command, Jafü Ungarn, have been set up to coordinate both German and hungarian interceptors against the Fortresses.>
<BalatonAir44DeDb> <The units of Fliegerführer Ungarn have been quite successful in shooting down US bombers. Losses were heavy, but not as disastrous as in the home defence. Our hungarian comrades have given us great support, despite the chaotic political situation in Hungary. This situation has forces us to occupy the country. The US bombing raids have now shifted to Austria, so most German units based in Hungary will leave either for home defense or the east front, which is coming closer.>
<ArdennesDeBr> <Today, on December 16, 1944, at 0530, our offensive in the West has begun. Eight Panzer and thirteen Infantry divisions are attacking the relatively undefended Ardennes sector. Their goal: To drive a wedge towards Antwerp and cut off enemy troops in the Netherlands and Belgium. Luftflotte Reich almost had to cease interception of US raids and transferred the major portion of its remaining units to bases in western Germany. We will make a maximum effort to support this offensive. Most of our missions will be hampered by bad weather, though.>
<ArdennesDeDb> <The Ardennes offensive has failed. Our troops were not able to take Bastogne and got bogged down due to lack of fuel and endless air attacks. With its untrained pilots, the Luftwaffe was not able to properly support the ground troops, resulting in heavy losses in planes and pilots. On New Year's Day 1945, the Luftwaffe made a last, massive attack against allied airfields, Operation Bodenplatte. While our pilots managed to destroy a lot of enemy planes on the ground, enemy and friendly Flak caused crippling losses. The remainder of our planes will be transferred to the east front.>

<ArdennesUsBr> <Today, on December 16, 1944, the 5th and 6th German Panzer armies broke into the Ardennes through the Loshein Gap against our divisions protecting the region. The Sixth Panzer army attacking our V Corps at Elsborn Ridge accomplished little. At the same time the 5th Panzer Army, attacking the VIII Corps exploited it's lack of experience and is making quick advance. We must slow the Germans down in order to organise defense of Bastogne and prepare a counterattack. The task of allied tactical airpower will be constant attacks against enemy rear areas and securing air superiority.>
<ArdennesUsDb> <The enemy failed to take Bastogne and got bogged down by ceaseless air attacks and heroic resistance. The allied tactical air forces swept the Luftwaffe from the skies and effectively supported our counterattack. The Luftwaffe tried a suprise strike on New Year 1945, but our losses were quickly replaced. After that, the enemy has almost vanished from the air. Victory is close at hand now!>
<BerlinAir45UsBr> <The Ardennes offensive has been repulsed and the russian Army is closing on Berlin. Still, the 8th Air Force is constantly bombing the city. During recent days, the enemy has started to employ Jet fighters to attack our bombers. Use team work to defeat these Me 262s which are causing losses among our bombers.>
<BerlinAir45UsDb> <The Jet menace was finally ended in a series of massive air raids against their bases which forced the Jet units to abandon their bases around Berlin and evacuate farther south, where they cannot harm anybody. With the russians in Berlin, the war is almost over and we can all go home soon!>
<BerlinAir45DeBr> <After the failed operation Bodenplatte, almost all surviving fighter units have been transferred to Luftflotte 6 on the east front. One of the few units still intercepting the Americans are the two Gruppen of Jagdgeschwader 7. Equipped with Me 262 Jet fighters and led by some of the most able Officers in the Luftwaffe, JG 7 has just become operational. It may be too late, but at least we can show the Amis that we can still fight!>
<BerlinAir45DeDb> <The Me 262s of JG 7 turned out to be an extremely efficient weapon against US bombers. Especially when using the newly developed rocket weapons, they scored many kills. After the Americans realized the threat from the Jets, they literally bombed their bases to pieces. JG 7  had to evacuate the area around Berlin and flee to Prague, where it is essentially grounded due to lack of fuel and an uprising going on in the city. For JG 7, the war is over. It had a brief, but spectacular history.>

<NormandyRAFGbBr> <Operation Overlord, the Invasion of France, has begun! After joining up the five beaches and establishing a firm bridgehead covering 50 miles along the Channel coastline, we continue our offensive. Whilst American forces broke out from Utah towards Barneville to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula, we stike in the Caen direction, drawing the German tank divisions around the regional capital. Your unit is one of the first of RAF to be based on an advanced landing ground in Normandy. Your main task is to fly tactical support for the troops and defend the invasion ports and troops from German raids. Heavy Luftwaffe resistance is to be expected.>
<NormandyRAFGbDb> <After being stuck in the Bocage for several weeks, US troops finally broke out during Operation Cobra. After failed German counterattacks at Mortain, General Patton's enveloping maneuver caught the German forces in Normandy in a huge pocket near Falaise. Tactical airpower helped to reduce this pocket to rubble, and even hundreds of thousands of German soldiers escaped, their entire equipment and weapons were lost. The German army is in full retreat all across France and Paris is due to be liberated soon. Tactical airpower had a huge part in this success. The allied tactical air forces managed to almost anihilate the Luftwaffe over Normandy. Even more important was constant close support for our advancing troops, which proved instrumental for the successful Falaise operation.>
<ArdennesRAFGbBr> <Today, on December 16, 1944, the 5th and 6th German Panzer armies broke into the Ardennes through the Loshein Gap against our divisions protecting the region. The Sixth Panzer army attacking our V Corps at Elsborn Ridge accomplished little. At the same time the 5th Panzer Army, attacking the VIII Corps exploited it's lack of experience and is making quick advance. We must slow the Germans down in order to organise defense of Bastogne and prepare a counterattack. The task of allied tactical airpower will be constant attacks against enemy rear areas and securing air superiority.>
<ArdennesRAFGbDb> <The enemy failed to take Bastogne and got bogged down by ceaseless air attacks and heroic resistance. The allied tactical air forces swept the Luftwaffe from the skies and effectively supported our counterattack. The Luftwaffe tried a suprise strike on New Year 1945, but our losses were quickly replaced. After that, the enemy has almost vanished from the air. Victory is close at hand now!>

<G45GbBr> <The long push through Germany is beginning. Our exhausted Divisions can feel the end is in sight but the Germans have not given up, as their push over Christmas showed. Now the enemy is starting to field jets and other advanced planes so advancing and the capture of enemy bases has become a matter of urgency! On the plus side, the quality of enemy pilots is terrible.>
<G45GbDb> <We did it. Next stop Berlin!>

<CrusaderGbBr> <While more modern Italian fighter planes did not appear in North Africa, Royal Air Force squadrons of Hurricanes based in Egypt could feel free in the skies of Libya. Nevertheless, their numbers were not sufficient for sustained dogfights with the Fiats and up until September 13th, 1941 both sides held back from active offensive actions in the air. The second British offensive, operation Crusader, began at dawn on November 18th, 1941. At the beginning of December 1941 attacks by the Italian forces were stopped by the sudden five day offensive of British armed forces under the command of General Sir Archibald Wavell and General Sir Richard O'Connor.

<Africa41DeBr> <The scale of German military efforts towards helping Mussolini has increased. In April, I./JG-27 was moved at an airfield in Al Gazal, Libya. First operations of I./JG-27 fighters were completed on 19 April. The deployment of German fighters in the next ten months relieved the plight of Italian ground forces engaged in heavy fighting with the British.>
	
<Africa41DeDb> <At this time the situation in Northern Africa turned unfavourable for the Axis forces and there was a high probability that German and Italian forces could be forced out of Africa, putting the long-thought plans of Mussolini for capturing the entire Egypt under severe threat. Under the terms of the Steel Pact Hitler has pledged military support to the Italian dictator, but Mussolini also had his own ambitious plans.>

<Africa42DeBr> <At the beginning of April 1941, divisions of Deutsches Afrika Korps left the vicinity of Tobruk. German fighters were based at Al Gazal: this airfield was only eight miles west of the port. Messerschmitt pilots provided reliable cover to crews of Ju-87B-2 from IV./StG 2, periodically concluding raids for the defence of Tobruk. Counter attacks of the Allies were mainly in the form of attack of German troop positions. Air combats between the Luftwaffe and Allied fighters became more frequent.>

<Africa42DeDb> <After the fall of Tobruk, Axis forces continued to pursue the retreating enemy, covering 50km per day. Allied air forces were in a critical situation because they did not have the time to move East after the advances made by the motorised divisions of ground forces. On the other hand air support provided to Rommel's forces notably weakened: that had been undoubtedly a success for the British. Nevertheless the allied retreat threatened to become an escape right up to the gates of Cairo. RAF fighters, which could have provided cover to the columns going East, practically failed to appear in the sky.>

<Africa42tDeBr> <Main action tactics of the German fighters were based on superiority in speed: diving, attack and swift exit; taking part in dogfights needed to be avoided, if possible. Such tactics proved extremely effective in air combats over the desert. Excellent visibility was also on the side of the Luftwaffe: Allied planes were often attacked while still together in formation before they had time to react to the danger.>

<Africa42tDeDb> <Having gained after arrival in Africa 1000 victories during air combats,  pilots of I./JG-27 were convinced that they were facing a serious opponent here, capable to force down their planes even with expert pilots. On November 8th operation "Torch" started: landing of British and American troops in North African colonies of Vichy France. The fate of the campaign in North Africa was decided: Axis armies had only the option to fight for survival, and a victory march in Cairo was out of question.

<Africa40ItBr> <At the time when Italy declared war to Great Britain and France subdivisions of Africa Orientale Italiana (AOI) were in unenviable positions. Parts of AOI were cut off from the motherland and were based in a territory, fully surrounded by colonies of countries hostile to Italy. In addition, subdivisions of AOI were equipped with an out-of-date armament. On June 10th 1940 AOI had all in all 323 airplanes, 83 of which were considered not suitable to fly. AOI had 14 CR.42 and 32 CR.32 fighters in four squadrillie. Air forces of the Commonwealth countries opposing AOI consisted of 370 airplanes, which were also classified as "antiques". Nevertheless, the British had a few modern Hurricane fighters and Blenheim bombers. Unlike the Italians, the Allies could reinforce their air group in East Africa without problems.>

<Africa40ItDb> <Taking the initiative, in short space of time the Italians took British-occupied Somaliland, allowing air-forces of AOI to establish air superiority and thus conducting bombing runs on Burao airport, La Farouq and Hergeisa. Italians even attacked English marine escorts far in the Red sea. During one such flight mission, conducted on 11 February 1941, Captain Mario Vicentini, an ace who had 17 victories on his account died.>

<Africa41ItBr> < The emergence of the Germans in Africa and especially the Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, little-known at that time, was instrumental in rising of moral spirit of the Italian soldiers and officers. Warfare action restarted with renewed strength. Fighters with crests from Fliegerfuhrer Africa appeared in the air. Due to shortage of modern airplanes in the 5 Squadra Aerea this squadron contributed very little to the new offensive operation of the Axis forces on the North African theatre of the war. The Italian air force operated mainly at night.>

<Africa41ItDb> <Compared to other subdivisions 5 Squadra Aereas distinct activity for its fighters was to provide cover for Ju-87 dive bombers from the Luftwaffe. In the course of spring-summer 1941 close and strengthened cooperation between Regia Aeronautica and Luftwaffe was created, especially on subdivisions level.>

<Africa42ItBr> <At the beginning of January 1942 the British troops have just moved up to Al Adjeila, but at this time they were expecting to be in control of the whole of Libya. Rommel inflicted a devastating blow to the plans of the Allies. Desert Fox began a counter offensive on January 21st. All available Italian fighter planes pursued the enemy retreating in panic. On January 29th the Germans and the Italians have taken back Benghazi, where planes of 6 and 160 Gruppo were immediately relocated; 8 Gruppo were also shifted to the East at Al-Adjeila, 3 Gruppo at Sidi-Al-Ahmar.>

<Africa42ItDb> <After the fall of Tobruk Axis forces continued to pursue the retreating enemy, covering 50km per day. Allied air forces were in a critical situation because they did not have the time to move East after the advances made by the motorised divisions of ground forces.

RAF fighters, which could have provided cover to the columns going East, practically failed to appear in the sky.>

<Africa42tItBr> <Despite the heroic behaviours shown by Italian and German soldiers, Rommel's attacks on Al-Alamein stalled. RAF air strikes in the desert on Rommel's armour proved quite effective. On October 23rd it became very clear: the second battle at Al Alamein finished with the defeat of the Axis forces. From now on fortune turned its back on Axis troops.>

<Africa42tItDb> <On November 8th operation "Torch" started: landing of British-American troops in North-African colonies of Vichy France. For Rommel it became instantly clear that the fate of the campaign in North Africa had already been decided: his armies had only the option to fight for survival, and a victory march in Cairo was out of question. The Allies locked Deutsches Afrika Korps on the territory of Western Libya and Tunisia.>

<Murmansk4ARuBr> <The Germans have been massing around Kirkenes in northern Norway and on the 22nd June they crossed the border into northern Finland,occupying the Petsamo area. This puts them within easy striking range of Murmansk. Our ice-free gateway to the northern seas and the Northern Fleet itself are at risk. Nor is Murmansk the only target - if the enemy can cut the railway to the south then Murmansk will starve. The units of the 14th Air Army and the Northern Fleet Airforce have outdated aircraft - High Command have assessed the situation and new aircraft including cannon-armed Polikapov I-16's and the latest MiG-3's and LaGG-3's will arrived in less than a month. But that gives the enemy some three weeks to cover the short distance from the Finnish border. We have two advantages: in contrast to the disasters further south in Poland and the Ukraine, effective aircraft dispersal and poor weather on the 22nd itself have meant that very few of our aircraft were lost in the initial German strikes. Secondly, our pilots are among the most experienced of all Soviet aviators. Many have fought in the Winter War and against the Japanese and are older than average. We need to hold out until we can get reinforcements from the south. In addition, there is already talk of alliance with Britain and Murmansk will be a key part of any proposed military cooperation.>


<Murmansk4ARuDb> <We have taken many casualties and had to give up vital ground, but all is not lost! Last night LaGG-3 and model 24 I-16's were flown in from Monchegorsk. The British have flown in Hurricanes from a naval unit offshore and more are being assembled near Archangelsk. It is time to avenge our fallen comrades!>

<Murmansk41RuBr> <The Germans have swept over the border from Finland but are finding it much harder going than they expected. They seem to have split their forces in two - one group headed directly for Murmansk, the other attempting to cut the railway lines further south. If either succeeds, we are lost. British convoys have started arriving, bringing much needed supplies, including modern Hurricane fighters and pilots and engineers who will help us get them into service. 2 GSAP of the Northern Fleet have received a squadron of MiG-3's and some Pe-2 bombers while the 14th Air Army have got LaGG-3's. Cannon-armed I-16's have started knocking down enemy Stukas and there is a growing sense of confidence in our forces. The enemy may be hurting us but we are certainly hurting them! Our mission is to protect Murmansk and the British convoys.>


<Murmansk41RuDb> <It is now dark for 22 hours a day and the intense polar cold has grounded all flying. The British squadrons returned home at the end of November, leaving us hundreds of aircraft, with more arriving every month. Our forces have been battered and stretched beyond belief and many of our most experienced pilots have died, but still we fight one. We will see what 1942 has in store when flying resumes at the beginning of February.>

<Murmansk42RuBr> <In spite of the heroic efforts of all our comrades, the Germans remain within striking distance of Murmansk. The British have been sending us P-40 fighters that are gradually filling up our Naval airforce regiments and now that the USA is in the war it seems we have been promised plenty more. Furthermore, after the danger to Moscow receeded in January with our successful counter-attacks we have started getting PVO units to help protect Murmansk from enemy bombing. We have also converted 120 Hurricanes to carry bombs, as the famous IL-2 Sturmovik is required for the central combat zones to the south. To counter our growing strength, the Germans are switching tactics. Rather than attacking Murmansk directly they are attacking the British and US convoys with a new Gruppe of He-111 torpedo bombers, I/KG26, who have been training in Italy. Together with Ju-88 dive bombers they represent a real threat to our lifeline from the West. Meanwhile Bf-110's and Ju-88's are hitting the railway to the heartlands as quickly as we can repair it. However it seems our successes last year have at least driven the ageing Ju-87 Stuka out of the northern skies!>

<Murmansk42RuDb> <The war in the north seems to have bogged down into stalemate. The Germans cannot dislodge us from Murmansk and have contented themselves with disrupting our supply chain by attacking convoys and the railway. For our part we seem unable to mass sufficient reserves to push the Germans back out of northern Finland; the thousands of trucks, jeeps, tanks, radios and the tonnes of other supplies are mostly going to feed the bitter struggle west of Moscow. Good news though - the German Sixth Army has been surrounded in Stalingrad and news comes of a major push by our forces west of Moscow.>

<Murmansk43RuBr> <After the shock of seeing the latest German fighters like the Messerschmitt Bf-109F and the Focke-Wulf 190A3 tear through our regiments last year, it seems we are finally achieving parity in terms of equipment. Our fighter regiments have received the P-39 Airacobra and later versions of the P-40. The Yaks and Lavochkins are reaching comparable quality and the latest IL-2's with rear gunner seats and modern munitions are filling our attack regiments. The incomparable Boston is replacing the slower Hampden and IL-4 in our bomber regiments and after the success of the great Stalingrad encirclement battle it seems the Germans are now on the back foot. We must not be complacent though - the Messerschmitt model G has appeared in the North and the German flak is deadlier than ever.>


<Murmansk43RuDb> <This year has been hard. The loss of so many of our comrades for so little change on the ground is a terrible blow. But while we have held our positions here, the Germans have lost thousands of tanks at Kursk and have been driven out of the Kuban, while their front now stands hundreds of kilometres from the gates of Moscow. And it is due in no small part to our efforts here. And we have been assured that next year will see a great strategic offensive!>

<Murmansk44RuBr> <You have just returned to the north after a well-earned period of relative calm instructing at the flying school in Lipetsk. That sunshine must have been terrible - I'm sure you're glad to be back in the ice and cold. You are just in time for the big push west - the Petsamo-Kirkenes operation. Our forces have advanced into the Karelian Isthmus and knocked Finland out of the war, which together with a strategic realignment by Sweden has left German forces in the north quite isolated. British and Norwegian units flying out of Scotland are harrying German sea supply traffic and reports from German prisoners speak of low fuel and ammunition stocks. It is time to advance and sieze the moment. The main danger will come from the fighter and Jabo units of Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey, a large part of which decamped into our area of operations after the Finnish ceasefire in the south. We need to prevent them hitting our army and its chain of supply as we advance.>



<Murmansk44RuDb> <Victory! For the second time in five years we have occupied northern Finland after a hard-fought campaign - and this time we are not about to hand it back. The Petsamo region and its nickel mines will remain ours. American airforce units secretly based in northern Sweden have begun ferrying Norwegian armed policemen into what remains of Kirkenes. Our troops will withdraw as soon as the Norwegians feel they have things under control. The German troops who were threatening Murmansk so recently are retreating in disorder down the spine of Norway.>



<Murmansk4ADeBr> <Gentlemen, welcome! THe bad weather of the last few days is breaking up and it is time to attack. Unfortunately we have lost the element of surprise that has seen the Russian airforce devastated in the central sectors. Still, no matter - we are opposed only by older Polikarpov fighters here and a few of the so-called "fast bombers" that are no match for our Messerschmitts. Our hardy mountain troops have occupied northern Finland with our ally's agreement and last night began crossing the Russian border. Murmansk is close!>


<Murmansk4ADeDb> <Our troops have advanced, but not as we had hoped. The Russian resistance has been fiercer than expected and the Russian fliers have committed themselves with a bravery and skill we had not anticipated. This kind of low altitude skirmishing is something new for us but we will have to adapt! More bad news: reconnaissance of Russian bases has revealed the presence of more modern fighters and bombers like the MiG-3, LaGG-3 and Pe-2. In addition a British convoy has been spotted north of Murmansk.>

<Murmansk41DeBr> <The High Command, frustrated by the slow progress of our army towards Murmansk, has cancelled the southern push to cut the Kirov Railroad and has put all our assets in the north with the aim of being in Murmansk before the weather closes in. The air war in the north is about to intensify. LaGG-3 aircraft yesterday intercepted Stukas over Ristikent and British Hurricanes have been spotted near Murmansk, presumably on orientation flights. Whether the pilots are British or Russian has yet to be determined. The time has come for an all-out effort to bomb a way clear for our attacking divisions and to prevent the Soviet airmen from stalling our advance.>


<Murmansk41DeDb> <In spite of the huge number of enemy aircraft shot down by our fighters and the devastation wrought by our Stukas and bombers, we have still not decisively routed the Soviets. The British convoys have supplied the enemy with hundreds of fighters and the presence of newer Russian types has made us wary of committing unescorted aircraft. The Stuka is to be withdrawn from the north - we have simply lost too many. We need to refit over the winter and see what 1942 will bring.>



<Murmansk42DeBr> <Last year we almost reached Murmansk but we ran out of supplies and momentum and had to withdraw a little as winter closed in. Now the weather has opened up again it is time to maintain pressure on the enemy. A special factor now is the large amount of British and US convoys making for Murmansk and Archangelsk - the Ju-88's and He-111's are finding it harder and harder to attack them and will need escorting. For the fighter pilots things look good: we have sent our old Messerschmitt Bf109T-2's back to the Navy and we have late-model Emils and are getting the newer Bf-109F's in the fighter Gruppen and even some Fw-190A models as fast strike aircraft. The enemy has nothing that can match us!>

<Murmansk42DeDb> <As 1942 draws to a close, we have experienced neither the early rapid advances of German units further south, nor their later collapse. The front line has remained stable, success and failure measured more in terms of our interdiction of the enemy's supply chain. We have had our successes but too much is still getting through.>


<Murmansk43DeBr> <The advantages we had in 1942 are eroding fast: the new Bf109G in our fighter regiments no longer stands head and shoulders above the enemy, now that they have received large numbers of the American Airacobra. Their Yak and Lavochkin fighters are also of better quality and are available in greater numbers, while their newer IL-2's with rear gunner are harder targets. The quality of their pilots in this sector is getting better all the time. But fight we must: American ships are bringing aluminium, bombers and tanks to the enemy. The British carry fighters, jeeps and radios. If we cannot sink their ships we have to hit the railways that carry these supplies to the interior. And then there are the steadily increasing numbers of Russian troops, tanks, trucks and artillery massed against us. We will need repeated attacks to disrupt any thoughts they may have of attacking us.>


<Murmansk43DeDb> <This year has been hard. The loss of so many of our comrades for so little change on the ground is a terrible blow. And while we have held our positions here, our units have lost thousands of tanks at Kursk and have been driven out of the Kuban, while our panzers now stand hundreds of kilometres from the gates of Moscow. There seems to be little prospect of a quick reversal in our fortunes.>


<Murmansk44DeBr> <Information from Russian prisoners suggests that a major offensive is about to be lauched against us. Our aerial reconnaissance would appear to confirm this - large numbers of IL-2 Sturmoviks have been concentrated on airbases near the front. Our situation is serious - the Finnish ceasefire and the Swedish strategic realignment have left us isolated, reduced to getting supplies up the long Norwegian coast in vulnerable freighters under constant attack from British and Norwegian units flying out of Scotland. However in some ways we are stronger than last year - elements of Gefechtsverband Kuhlmey including new Fw-190F8 attack aircraft and new models of the Fw-190 and Bf-109G have joined us here in the north. Whether that is enough to make a difference is up to you!>


<Murmansk44DeDb> <The Russian onslaught was overwhelming. We seriously underestimated their resources and the concentrations of force they could employ. In light of our isolation and poor supply state it was all we could do to retreat in good order. The north belongs to the Russians.>


<MurmanskR41RuBr> <The Germans have swept over the border from Finland but are finding it much harder going than they expected. They seem to have split their forces in two - one group headed directly for Murmansk, the other attempting to cut the railway lines further south. If either succeeds, we are lost. British convoys have started arriving, bringing much needed supplies, including modern Hurricane fighters and pilots and engineers who will help us get them into service. 2 GSAP of the Northern Fleet have received a squadron of MiG-3's and some Pe-2 bombers while the 14th Air Army have got LaGG-3's. Cannon-armed I-16's have started knocking down enemy Stukas and there is a growing sense of confidence in our forces. The enemy may be hurting us but we are certainly hurting them! Our mission is to establish German positions for our artillery and bombers to attack.>


<MurmanskR41RuDb> <It is now dark for 22 hours a day and the intense polar cold has grounded all flying. The British squadrons returned home at the end of November, leaving us hundreds of aircraft, with more arriving every month. Our forces have been battered and stretched beyond belief and many of our most experienced pilots have died, but still we fight one. We will see what 1942 has in store when flying resumes at the beginning of February.>


<MurmanskS42DeBr> <Last year we almost reached Murmansk but we ran out of supplies and momentum and had to withdraw a little as winter closed in. Now the weather has opened up again it is time to maintain pressure on the enemy. A special factor now is the large amount of British and US convoys making for Murmansk and Archangelsk - Germany's first torpedo attack unit, I/KG26 has been sent to Kirkenes after training in Italy. We will sink the Allied shipping!>

<MurmanskS42DeDb> <As 1942 draws to a close, we have experienced neither the early rapid advances of German units further south, nor their later collapse. The front line has remained stable, success and failure measured more in terms of our interdiction of the enemy's supply chain. We have had our successes but too much is still getting through.>

<YouAreBack> <\nYou returned to active service\n>

<DeAConR>	<We are building a new ALG in the area. Your objective is to protect it against possible attacks.>
<DeAConR>	<Our engineers have began constructing a new temporary strip there. You will be flying over the general area, tasked with interception of any Luftwaffe planes that may try to interfere. Also, be on the lookout for Jerry recon planes. They may still be unaware of the construction, so let's keep it that way. >
<DeAConR>	<Your mission for today is to protect a new AGL being constructed there. Of course, every new ALG means shorter flight times to target for our planes, which means more air coverage, which means a quicker victory, and that of course means you going home sooner. So, do your job well today, and you just might all be home well before Christmas.>
<DeAConD>	<Yanks are building a new ALG there. We have enough of them already, eliminate it.>
