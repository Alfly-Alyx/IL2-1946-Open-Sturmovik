		 Translation guidelines. 

	Every line not starting with symbol < will be ignored. You may use it for comments.
 	Otherwise every message consists of two parts: message ID and Message text,
	both in < > brackets.

	For every ID code there may be up to 10 variants of texts - one will be picked up randomly.
	You don't need to translate every line exactly, you just need to describe the same situation.

	Symbols \n and %s must be left intact. \n means new line, %s means that some substring will be 
	placed there - usually town name. Some lines have space in the end. Please leave it in place -
	it means that there will be another sentence that will continue the briefing. The space separates them. 

	Message texts cannot contain new lines - make them as long as you need (but not longer than 256 chars).

<Lvov41DeBr> <On 22nd June 1941, our offensive against Stalin's Soviet Union will begin! Our forces, together with our allies from Finland, Rumania, Slovakia and Hungary, will attack along the entire Soviet western border. As a part of Luftflotte 2, our first task is to secure air supremacy in area around Lemberg. According to intelligence reports, much of the Soviet air force is concentrated on forward air fields. Our first task will be to put the Soviet planes out of action, preferably on the ground, then we will directly support our advancing armoured spearheads of Heeresgruppe Mitte. With luck, we will be in Moscow in a few months!>
<Lvov41DeDb> <The German attack was totally successful. Heeresgruppe Mitte took Lemberg after a few days. Luftflotte 2 was instrumental in this success. As on other parts of the front, the total of destroyed enemy planes is almost incredible, several thousands on the ground alone. The fighter units also maintained air cover above our troops by shooting down hundreds of attacking Soviet bombers. Our troops continue to advance deeper and deeper into Soviet territory. The Soviet resistance in the air has almost ceased, while on the ground numerous, but ill trained and equipped Soviet troops offer heavy resistance. The Luftwaffe is the decisive force in this ground war and we have to keep up our efforts to keep the pace of our advance.>
<Lvov41RuBr> <As a part of 15 SAD of the Kiev Special Military District, our unit is based on a forward airfield in the area of Lvov in the western Ukraine.

<Lvov41RuDb> <On the morning of June 22nd, the German forces attacked. The attack came as a total surprise and resulted in heavy losses. Lvov was lost after several days of fighting to the Germans, who were assisted by anti-Soviet Ukrainian nationalists. They committed many atrocities there and everywhere else. The VVS took extremely heavy losses, mainly on the ground due to surprise attacks. In the air, the VVS fought bravely and made the Germans pay a heavy price for their aggression.>

<BarbarossaDeBr> <Heeresgruppe Mitte is advancing on Smolensk, a main city on the road to Moscow exactly on the main axis of advance. The Soviets are know to have staked a lot into the defence of this city, at least six fresh Soviet armies equipped with modern weapons have been spotted in the area, and for the first time since the early days of this campaign, the Soviet air force is very active again. It looks as if the Soviet high command has selected the area around the city as the place for a major delaying action. Heeresgruppe Mitte will attempt to envelope the bulk of the Soviet forces near Orsha in yet another annihilation battle. Luftflotte 2, with Fliegerkorps II and VIII, will support this by breaking the concentration of Soviet airpower in this area and then by isolating the battlefield from the air and flying close support. The battle ahead may be decisive for the entire war!>
<BarbarossaDeDb> <Heeresgruppe Mitte has won a total victory in the Smolensk area! The bulk of the Soviet forces were enveloped and annihilated at Orsha and Yelnya, with yet another half million prisoners and thousands of guns and tanks captured. Luftflotte 2 was the key to this success, as the constant and accurate air support helped to halt the Soviet counterattack at Rogachev and managed to win air superiority against a strong force of Soviet fighter and bomber units, which for the first time since June tried to actively challenge the Luftwaffe. That challenge failed and the Soviet air strength in the central front has been all but annihilated, as has been the majority of Soviet armoured strength. Heeresgruppe Mitte moves onwards to Moscow!>
<BarbarossaRuBr> <The German forces on the central front are approaching Smolensk. Stavka has decided to try and hold the enemy advance in this area.

For the first time since the attack in June, we are under orders directly challenge the German Luftwaffe! Strong reinforcements, most notably many regiments equipped with the latest Yakovlev and LaGG fighters, as well as many of the new armoured attack aircraft Il-2 have been deployed to the area around Smolensk. Once air supremacy is established, we will be able to halt or even turn back the German aggression!>
<BarbarossaRuDb> <Due to many failures on division and corps command level, the German armies were able to envelop Red Army forces at Orsha and annihilate them, but only at a severe cost of their own. The VVS in the Smolensk area has been dealt severe losses in extremely hard fighting, but managed to maintain local superiority, even if only for a limited time. The new plane types have proved to be very effective. While as a whole the battle was a defeat, the sacrifice of our comrades at Smolensk has bought precious time to strengthen the defence of Moscow.>

<TyphoonDeBr> <The final push on Moscow has begun! Heeresgruppe Mitte will first attempt a giant pincer movement with the aim of enveloping the majority of the Red Army forces near Vyasma, followed by a direct thrust towards the Soviet capital. In order to succeed, Luftflotte 2 must make a maximum effort once again, even if its units, after three months of constant fighting, are only at 50 per cent strength. We have to take Moscow before the winter or Soviet reinforcements arrive and the Luftwaffe will win this race!>
<TyphoonDeDb> <We have suffered a serious defeat. While the initial pincer movement in front of Moscow was successful, annihilating yet another half million Soviet soldiers has cost Heeresgruppe Mitte much time. By the time the thrust on Moscow began, the typical Russian fall with mud and rain immobilized our forces, and by the time our offensive finally came in the vicinity of Moscow, "General Winter" struck, followed by severe Soviet counterattacks. Luftflotte 2 had already totally exhausted itself in supporting the Vyasma annihilation battle and was unable to prevent the total collapse of the front by December. While our remaining Messerschmitts still rule the sky when they are able to take off, they are almost permanently grounded due to cold and lack of spare parts, as are the bombers. The Luftflotte has nothing more to give and we can be glad if we can hold the front as it stands now. Conquering Moscow has now become all but impossible.>
<TyphoonRuBr> <After the battle of Smolensk, the German advance on Moscow getting faster again. Stavka has decided to commit the majority of the Red Army  of the western front west of Vyasma in a defensive position, while the Siberian forces have been ordered to transfer to the defence of Moscow. Western Front VVS and Moscow PVO have been allocated the vast majority of all modern aircraft available in the whole Soviet union and will support the defence of the Soviet capital with an all out effort. Absolute priority has the slowdown of enemy forces, as well as the defence of Moscow against enemy bombing raids.

<TyphoonRuDb> <For the first time in this war, we have achieved a great victory! While our forces suffered severe losses, the enemy advance was considerably slowed down by winter and constant pressure from both the Red Army and the VVS.

<Crimea41DeBr> <On the 5th October 1941 Wehrmacht forces reached the Sea of Azov, effectively cutting the land corridor into the Crimea and trapping Soviet forces on the peninsula. The Perekop Isthmus, only 8 km wide at its narrowest point, is once again fortified against an invader, as it was in the Civil War and by the Tatars and Greeks hundreds of years ago.It is no use - German tank forces, aided by Heinkel and Stuka bombers, have broken through the Perekop defences and have gained a foothold in the Crimea. Together with our Rumanian allies, fresh from their victory at Odessa two weeks ago, German forces are preparing to strike south at Simferopol, Crimea's capital, and Sevastopol, home of the Black Sea Fleet. Earlier this year we were involved in the victorious Greece Campaign and we have now been attached to Luftflotte 4, responsible for the Army Group South area in Operation Barbarossa - the attack on the Soviet Union. Together with the Rumanians we are holding the right flank, facing both the Red Airforce and the Black Sea Fleet air regiments. Our opponents are flying a few modern fighters such as the Yak and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of the older Polikarpov designs. Our successes so far and the high scores amassed by our pilots have been based on our skill, teamwork and determination to start every fight with the altitude advantage. >
<Crimea41DeDb> <Our forces now control the entire Crimea except for the port and city of Sevastopol, where determined Russian army and navy troops continue to defy us, backed by the determined Black Sea Fleet airforce. However winter is drawing in and the city lies besieged by German and Rumanian troops. It is time to look eastwards - north of the Crimea German forces are strectched along the Sea of Azov almost to the Don, but the Russian winter and growing Soviet strength have halted their advance. What will 1942 bring?>
<Crimea41RuBr> <The Crimea was protected by the bottleneck of the Perrekop Isthmus and our defensive lines, but the Germans and Rumanians have smashed their way through in heavy fighting. The Crimea lies open before them, with the prize of the Sevastopol Naval Base within their reach. It will be up to each one of us, the airmen of the Soviet Airforce and the Black Sea Fleet Naval Airforce, to slow down the enemy and give the defenders of Sevastopol and the Crimean capital, Simferopol, time to prepare. The Rumanians must surely have been badly weakened by their assault on Odessa earlier this month and the German supply lines are stretched to breaking point. Now is the time to deal them a bloody nose.>
<Crimea41RuDb> <Your valiant defence of the Crimea has left us in control of the port of Sevastopol but the enemy holds the rest of the Crimea, though weakly.The Germans and Rumanians surround us here and air battles continue as the weather permits, but both sides are beginning to conserve their forces for the inevitable spring push to capture the city. Yet even as the fate of Sevastopol grows desperate we hear of increasing resistance by our forces outside Moscow and Leningrad and our resolve to withstand the enemy will not falter. Indeed, plans are afoot to take advantage of the enemy's weakness in the rest of the Crimea. The coming year offers both despair and hope.>
<Crimea41RoBr> <After our costly victory at Odessa, the GAL is still recovering from its losses. However, we must support the German drive into the Crimea, in order to prevent further Raids on the homeland>
<Crimea41RoDb> <The GAL managed to support the offensive in Crimea, but Sevastopol ist still in soviet hands. We must keep up our efforts to capture it>

<Crimea42DeBr> <The 11th Army of Heeresgruppe Sd had taken all of the Crimea except the port city and fortress Sevastopol in last November. However, in December and January, while the Bulk of Luftflotte 4 was fighting the Soviet counteroffensive at Rostov, the Black Sea fleet undertook amphibious landings at Kerch, Eupatoria and Feodosia. This forced Generaloberst von Manstein to cancel the assault on Sevastopol. While the landings at Eupatoria and Feodosia were quickly wiped out by makeshift battle groups formed out of rear area units, the Kerch bridgehead could not be contained. The Soviets now again control most of the Kerch peninsula and are preparing for an offensive with at least army strength in order to retake the rest of the Crimea. Also, Sevastopol remains a thorn in the side of the German forces on the Crimea. After the fighting around Rostov quieted down, Luftflotte 4 was shifted back to the Crimea, in order to support the fight against both Kerch and Sevastopol. Its main tasks are the regaining of air superiority, the interdiction of supply ships and direct support for the 11th Army under von Manstein.>
<Crimea42DeDb> <The Soviets finally lashed out from the Kerch Bridgehead in the first days of March, but their strong, but ill coordinated and planned attack did not gain much ground, mostly thanks to constant attacks of the bombers, Stukas and Schlachtflieger of Luftflotte 4. On May 7th, the German counterattack began, again heavily supported by Luftflotte 4. Airbase raids destroyed much of the Soviet air force in this area, and the Soviet front entirely broke in just about two weeks. On May 20th, Kerch finally fell after bitter house fighting. The Kerch Bridgehead had been annihilated, with over 100.000 Soviet soldiers killed or captured. Generaloberst von Manstein could resume the operations to take Sevastopol. It took a bitter two months of trench and bunker warfare and 24.000 German casualties, but on July 1st, the Battle of Sevastopol was finally over. Without constant Luftwaffe support, led by the inventor of the Blitzkrieg tactic, Generaloberst von Richthofen, it would have been impossible to take Sevastopol. The Soviet fighter pilots flew very skillful and aggressive over Sevastopol, but were finally beaten. The Heeresgruppe Mitte has already launched Operation Blau to break through to the Volga at Stalingrad.>
<Crimea42RuBr> <At the beginning of spring 1942, the situation in the Crimea looks promising for our struggle. The amphibious landings of the Black Sea fleet this winter have been successful in establishing a very strong beachhead at the Kerch Peninsula, the Tartar rampart being the front right now. Also, the fortified defences of Sevastopol, as well as the skillful air defence of VVS Black Sea fleet have proven too strong for the Germans. With our supply situation improving day by day and the Germans having a fortress in their back they are unable to bypass, the chance is there to liberate the Crimea from the German occupation! Strong air forces have been allocated to VVS Crimean front and the VVS Black Sea fleet fighter squadrons has proven themselves as a skillful force equal to all the Germans have. Soon we will launch our offensive and drive the Germans from the Crimea!>
<Crimea42RuDb> <We have suffered another defeat. Due to many mistakes made in the leadership of the Crimean front, our offensive was launched without proper coordination and intelligence and bogged down after a few days. By removing air strength from other sectors, the Luftwaffe brought together a huge air force in the Crimea, which made front movement almost impossible. The Luftwaffe simply overwhelmed the VVS Crimean front, while it fought bravely, it was destroyed. Kerch fell in the end of May. This enabled the German army commander, General von Manstein, to concentrate its forces on Sevastopol. Our troops and the VVS Black Sea fleet fought heroically, and the fleet launched a maximum effort to  supply the city. But the German strength was simply too much. At least the Fleet managed to evacuate many of the defenders in a heroic operation, but on the end the German raised their banner over Sevastopol.>

<Crimea42RoBr> <Suprise soviet winter counteroffensives nearly suceeded in driving us from the Crimea again. The army must defend the strongholds and defeat further counteroffensives, in order to switch to offensive again. The GAL must support this battle at all costs!>
<Crimea42RoDb> <The soviet counteroffensives failed, giving us and the germans the possibility to capture Sevastopol after taking Kerch. The city fell after a bitter infantry assault, the Crimea is ours now!>

<Kuban42DeBr> <Operation Blau, Heeresgruppe Sd's break through the Don front aimed at Stalingrad, has been a huge success so far. On the southern flank of the main axis of advance, the Caucasus coast is becoming increasingly isolated. The Wehrmacht is advancing in this direction as well, aiming at the ports of the Kuban coast, where the Black Sea fleet has fled after being driven from Odessa and Sevastopol. The aim of this drive is to take the Soviet oil fields at Baku on the Caspian Sea, the main source of oil for the Soviets. The advance is slowed down by mountainous terrain. Once again, the success of this operation will depend on the air support of Luftflotte 4.>
<Kuban42DeDb> <The thrust into the Caucasus was successful. Our troops of the Gebirgsjger have put up the German flag on Mount Elbrus and our Panzer divisions are advancing towards Astrakhan. Our forces have taken the port cities on the coast. The only problem is the fighting at Stalingrad, which will demand the transfer of almost all units of Luftflotte 4 northward to support the main thrust of Heeresgruppe Mitte.>
<Kuban42RuBr> <Strong German forces have broken through the Don front and took Rostov in July. Our forces cannot stop the German advance right now. While the main German advance seems to be towards the Volga, the Germans are also attempting an attack on the Caucasus. This area is of strategic importance, as it is the main source of oil for the Soviet Union. The VVS will support Soviet units at the Kuban coast in an attempt to buy time for organizing a defence of the Volga front and the Caucasus oil cities.>
<Kuban42RuDb> <While the Germans have penetrated deep into the Caucasus, we have been successful in establishing a fairly defendable front at the Kuban coast. The VVS fought well against the Luftwaffe and showed a lot of progress from previous battles. The focus of the fighting in the southern sector is increasingly shifting northwards, to Stalingrad.>

<Kuban42HDeDb> <The thrust into the Caucasus was successful. Our troops of the Gebirgsjger have put up the German flag on Mount Elbrus and our Panzer divisions are advancing towards Astrakhan. Our forces have taken the port cities on the coast. The only problem is the fighting at Stalingrad, which will demand the transfer of almost all units of Luftflotte 4 northward to support the main thrust of Heeresgruppe Mitte.>
<Kuban42RoBr> <Stepped up plane production in Rumania and more deliveries from Germany have made it possible to bring up all GAL squadrons to full strenght again and also to phase out the last polish and british plane types from front service. The new GAL will support the Rumanian mountain Corp's drive into the Caucasus.>
<Kuban42RoDb> <The newly equipped GAL squadrons fought a successful air battle over the Kuban coast. However, the advance of the rumanian and german mountain corps was stalled, due to lack of supplies and a new priority: Stalingrad.>

<StalingradDeBr> <Generaloberst Paulus' 6th Army is advancing on Stalingrad. We have crossed the Tchir and are heading towards the very important industrial City on the Volga. Stalingrad is important not only because of its industry, but also because it is the gate to the Caucasus. By taking it, Heeresgruppe Sd can sever the connection between the oil fields of the Caucasus and the rest of the Soviet Union. The Battle of Stalingrad may decide the whole war! Luftflotte 4 has been severely strengthened by Fliegerkorps X that had been pulled back from Sicily. The Russians know of the importance of this battle as well and both the army and the air force have been strengthened severely. The Luftwaffe will have to do its utmost to support the drive of the 6th Army in this very important battle. >
<StalingradDeDb> <The 6th Army has taken the major part of Stalingrad and has crossed the Volga at several points. Luftflotte 4 has been instrumental in this struggle. The VVS has been up in strength as never before on the southern front, with new types and much more aggressive than ever. Nevertheless, the fighters of the Luftwaffe have gained control in the air and inflicted heavy losses at a relatively light cost. Troubling us is the weather situation, which is becoming increasingly worse in the last days. If this continues, we will not be able to fly in a few days and our troops will not be able to advance further without air cover.>
<StalingradRuBr> <The Germans are advancing on Stalingrad! Stavka has transferred every air unit at hand to the Volga front. The City must not fall, because that would sever the connection between the Caucasus and the rest of the USSR, stopping our indigenous oil supply and leaving us at the mercy of oil from the western allies. To prevent that, strong forces have been allocated to this sector. The VVS, equipped with new types and with the experience gained in the struggles of over a year, will try to claim air superiority. Stalingrad must not fall!>
<StalingradRuDb> <At the beginning of October, the German advance has been almost stopped. While the Germans control a major part of Stalingrad, every inch is costing them dearly and our forces are becoming stronger day by day. Soon we will launch a counteroffensive and drive them back!>
<StalingradHDeBr> <Generaloberst Paulus' 6th Army is advancing on Stalingrad. We have crossed the Tchir and are heading towards the very important industrial City on the Volga.

If this continues, we will not be able to fly in a few days and our troops will not be able to advance further without air cover.>
<StalingradRoBr> <The german 6th Army is engaged in bitter fighting in the city of Stalingrad. Sofar, heavy russian resistance has made it impossible to totally capture the city. Rumanian units are holding the flanks of the 6. Army, making it possible for the germans to concentrate their forces in the city itself. Since Action on the flanks is rather low, GAL squadrons will directly support the germans in Stalingrad itself.>
<StalingradRoDb> <With heavy air support, including the hard fighting GAL units, the 6th Army was able to take the major part of Stalingrad. However, the fighting still goes on and currently bad weather is seriously interfering with flight operations.>

<Stalingrad2DeBr> <We have a serious situation at the Stalingrad front. The Russians have used to past November days of bad weather to launch a pincer operation at the flanks of the 6th army covered by Rumanian units. Both the northern and southern attacks have been completely devastating, totally scattering our front and throwing our entire rear area into total chaos. As you know well, several field bases of the Luftwaffe were overrun in the last days. The Soviets have trapped almost the entire 6th Army in a pocket around Stalingrad. The Staff of Luftflotte 4 and Panzergruppe Hoth are desperately trying to form a holding front made up mostly of scratch units formed from rear echelons and Luftwaffe ground personnel. At the same time, High command has ordered the Luftwaffe to resupply the 6th army, which is to remain at Stalingrad in order to bind Soviet forces. Oberst Dr. Khl, the Commodore of KG55, has been tasked with the coordination of the air effort to help Stalingrad. But with bad weather, a rear area in total confusion, our main airbases  under constant threat of being overrun, a precarious supply situation and the Soviet air force stronger than ever this task will be extremely difficult.>
<Stalingrad2DeDb> <It is over. On the 2nd February, the 6th Army capitulated. 200.000 German soldiers have been killed or captured. The Luftwaffe has given all it had, but it wasn't enough. The airlift alone cost 488 planes, an entire Fliegerkorps! But without Luftflotte 4, the situation would have been much worse. The Luftwaffe attacked advancing troops, protected the airfields in the pocket and often had to defend its own airfields. Heeresgruppe Sd will have to pull back to the Don front, except for the Kuban bridgehead, which will most likely have to be evacuated as well. For the first time in this war, we have suffered a total defeat. An uncertain future lies ahead of all of us.>
<Stalingrad2RuBr> <Operation Uranus, the Pincer movement against Kalach, was a huge success. The German 6th Army is now trapped in Stalingrad. For unknown reasons, the Germans have not yet attempted to break out of the pocket. We now have a unique opportunity at hand: To destroy an entire German field army and blunt the German war effort for the entire East front! As they did at Demyansk and Kholm in the northern sector, the Germans will most likely try to supply the 6th army from the air. The VVS will try to interdict the supply effort both by attacking airbases and shooting down transports in the air.>
<Stalingrad2RuDb> <In 2nd February 1943, the German 6th Army under command of Generaloberst Paulus capitulated. Over 200.000 half starved German and Rumanian soldiers have been taken prisoner. The terrible conditions in Stalingrad bear witness to how effective the efforts of the VVS against the air supply operations have been. This has been our greatest victory yet. Even more, the whole German front has been pushed back until almost the starting point of last year's German summer offensive. The German front is that weak that it might be possible to break through at Kharkov and liberate the entire Ukraine!>

<Stalingrad2RoBr> <Disaster has befallen the rumanian army! In cover of bad weather, the soviets have launched a pincer attack at both flanks of the 6th Army. Our forces are totally overrun. Entire divisions have been anihilated by the russians! Some forward based fighter units also had to defend their own airfields. Our task will be to support the german relief effort for Stalingrad, as well as protecting our flanks against further offensives.>
<Stalingrad2RoDb> <The germans surrendered at Stalingrad in February, leaving behind two dead armies, one of them rumanian. Over half a million rumanians have been killed in action or missing. The GAL has done everything it could and was virtually anihilated in the desperate fighting. We will rebuild our strenght, but currently the AAR is finished as a fighting force.>

<Rzhev42DeBr> <The summer of 1942 had seen no greater front movements in the central sector of the East front. The units of Heeresgruppe Mitte were able to establish a fairly stable defensive position. But a Soviet bulge existed in the front, with the western and southernmost point being Rzhev. It was clear that the Soviets would use this position to lash out southward. The units of Luftflotte 2 had been severely weakened during the last months, major units were transferred both to Luftflotte 4 and the Mediterranean front. While the fighters have received the new Fw 190 fighter, the Soviets have introduced new planes that match the performance of our fighters. They are also becoming more and more aggressive and better in tactics. On November 18th, the Soviets opened their winter offensive from Rzhew and Velikye Lukiy. Luftflotte 2 in this area only had the two Gruppen of JG 51 Mlders, the KG 4 and several staffeln of Stukas, as well as a new Hs 129 squadron, forming Gefechtsverband Schmidt. Gefechtsverband Schmidt is tasked with close support against the advancing Soviets as well as air defence.>
<Rzhev42DeDb> <The Soviets succeeded in throwing back Heeresgruppe Mitte further, but the main goal, trapping large forces of it in a huge pocket west of Vyasma has not been accomplished. The Wehrmacht managed to withdraw from the Vyasma bulge during the Bffel movement without great losses. In a movement war, losing territory is preferrable to losing troops. The scratch formation, Gefechtsverband Schmidt, was instrumental in this move, it kept constant pressure on the Soviets. The new Fw 190s have proven themselves to be very suited for East front conditions. After the setbacks of the winter, our forces are still intact and we will turn the tide this summer!>
<Rzhev42RuBr> <After the difficult winter battles of early 1942, the central front before Moscow remained quiet during summer. The Germans threw all their forces in the advance in the south, while we were gathering strength. The frontline gave us the opportunity to try a pincer operation southward from the bulge at Rzhew in an attempt to isolate most of the German forces on the Moscow front, much the same like our comrades in the south did at Stalingrad. The German Luftwaffe in this area has fielded a new fighter, the Focke-Wulf 190. We still have not much experience against this type, but I am sure our new planes and tactics are up to this challenge. There are also reports of Spanish pilots flying with the Luftwaffe's Mlders squadron in this sector. In order for our offensive to succeed, the VVS must wrestle air superiority from the Germans and enable our troops to operate without a threat from German bombers.>
<Rzhev42RuDb> <Our offensive from Rzhew was a success, the Red Army was able to liberate another large area of the Russian SSR from German occupation. However, the advance was slower than expected, this enabled a large number of German troops to escape encirclement. While the strategic goal was not fully met, the operation was still a success. The VVS has once again proven itself. Our fighters managed to master air combat against the new German fighters, while our ground attackers were more efficient than ever in supporting our troops. The next large operation will most likely take place in summer.>

<Kuban43DeBr> <Things are beginning to look a little brighter again in the southern area: General von Manstein managed to blunt the Soviet advance at Kharkov with a series of bold manoeuvre battles, stabilizing the front. This ended the possibility of a "Super-Stalingrad" in the entire Crimea, Kuban and southern Ukraine. While the front is relatively stable in the Ukraine, Stalin apparently decided to try smaller bites first. Forces of Heeresgruppe Sd are still holding a chunk of the Soviet Kuban coast from Taman to Novorossisk. Intelligence indicates the Red Army will launch its next offensive exactly there. For that reason, the major part of Luftflotte 4, including the whole Jagdgeschwader 52, have been sent to airfields in the Kuban and Eastern Crimea. They will try to support the bridgehead against the Soviet onslaught. Since the flying weather is good, I am confident we will be able to achieve air supremacy. It is known the Soviet air force has moved very strong units there, mainly equipped with planes delivered from the Americans or British.>
<Kuban43DeDb> <The Soviets have failed to crush the Kuban bridgehead, but it was a close call. They managed to retake about half of the bridgehead and we will be forced to abandon it to avoid losing the troops holding it. The really worrying news is the extremely tough air battles that were fought over the Kuban. The Soviet air force, especially the fighters, was very well organized, numerically superior and very aggressive. The aces of JG 3 and 52 managed to hold themselves, but the air war over the East front is not what it used to be just half a year ago. The air war of the East front is becoming more and more unfavourable for our side.>
<Kuban43RuBr> <Even after our successful operation in the Don front area, the Germans still hold the Crimea and a bridgehead at the Kuban coast. The Red Army will eliminate this beachhead, liberating the coast from Krasnodar to Taman. A fast operation is necessary, as we want to deny the Germans the possibility of evacuation their forces to the Crimea. It can be assumed the Germans will move strong air forces into the bridgehead in order to support their troops. We have build up the VVS in this area as well. The battle will be a good opportunity to test new tactics and planes.>
<Kuban43RuDb> <Our troops have managed to liberate Krasnodar and a good part of the Kuban coast. More importantly, the VVS performed extremely well. For the very first time, the VVS met a strong Luftwaffe concentration head on and came out victorious. Our new tactics have proved to be very effective. While the German Kuban bridgehead has not been totally eliminated, the Germans will have to evacuate it in order to avoid greater losses. The frontlines are now set for a decision this summer.>

<Kuban43RoBr> <The rumanian mountain corps, as well as its german comrades, are still holding the Kuban bridgehead. A soviet offensive against this last foothold on asian soil is likely. The AAR has been brought up to at least some strenght again by new deliveries from Germany, but the main burden of air defense is german. Our task is to support the Bridgehead against soviet offensives.>
<Kuban43RoDb> <The soviet offensives failed on most points, except for the Myashako bridgehead, which has been contained. But it is obvious that the Kuban cannot hold on forever. The AAR gave a good account of itself has earned the respect of their german comrades.>

<KurskDeBr> <After difficult defensive winter battles in the Ukraine, the frontlines have stabilized themselves again in April 1943. A significant Soviet bulge had developed at Kursk, followed by a German Bulge, the Orelbogen, north of it. At the time, the German high command had decided to crush this bulge in a pincer operation from north and south. The most modern equipment, including new heavy tanks will be brought up to support the offensive. The operation has allready been delayed twice and Soviet forces in the bulge are very strong and fortified. Luftflotte 4 will support the northern Thrust from Orel. Main tasks will include winning air supremacy, close support and raids against the Soviet supply system.>
<KurskDeDb> <Our offensive at Kursk met extremely heavy resistance. The advance bogged down after only a few kilometers due to heavy fortifications and strong counterattacks. The Soviets have had terrible losses but continue to throw more and more tanks at our poor soldiers. Luftflotte 4 gave an excellent performance against a very strong Soviet air force.  And even more important, our Stukas and Schlachtflieger managed to locate and destroy a Soviet brigade trying to envelop our northern thrust. The efforts of our Pilots alone turned a total defeat into a bloody draw. But the Orelbogen cannot be hold anymore, we will have to abandon it. For the first time, a major German summer offensive has failed.>
<KurskRuBr> <After this year's winter offensives, our forces have occupied a huge bulge in the front around Kursk. It is obvious the German leadership plans an attack on this bulge as the starting point for their summer offensive this year. For reasons unknown to us, however, this offensive has been delayed for almost two months now. This gave us the possibility the strengthen our forces in the Kursk bulge to a point an attack cannot succeed. We expect the German forces to attack anyway, though. The task of our Air army will be to support the defence against the southern German pincer. Our main task will be to secure air supremacy and to attack German tanks and supply columns.>
<KurskRuDb> <The German offensive starting in June became a total disaster for the Germans. Even though the German army used its most modern tanks, their advance did not get far in face of the heroic resistance of our Red Army soldiers. While the VVS failed to destroy the Luftwaffe forces on the ground, it managed to claim air superiority in hard fought air battles, while our attack squadrons wiped out entire tank divisions! For the first time, we blunted a German offensive from the start. This may well be the turning point of the war!>

<Kubanlate43DeBr> <After the failed Operation Zitadelle, the Russians have launched an offensive in the entire Ukraine. The Crimea is about to be cut off and in the Ukraine, Feldmarschall von Manstein has ordered the Army Group South to retreat behind the Dnjepr. The Kuban Bridgehead is totally isolated, and the 17th Army has to be evacuated. High Command has ordered the evacuation by sea to the Crimea, which is also threatened. The Luftwaffe has to protect the Evacuation with the meager remaining forces after the losses from Kursk. We are numerically inferior, but the fighting spirit of our fighter units is unbroken. Heavy resistance in the air and a massive sortie from the Black Sea fleet have to be expected.>
<Kubanlate43DeDb> <The last German soldier has left the Asiatic continent on the 9th October, when Taman was evacuated. The operation went along as planned with remarkably low losses, due to the heroic efforts of our Luftwaffe. The fighters of JG 52 have retained air supremacy and the Stukas managed to sink three Soviet destroyers and dealt a crippling blow to the Black Sea fleet.>
<Kubanlate43RuBr> <After the German offensive at Kursk has failed, the red army has launched a liberating offensive in the entire Ukraine! The German forces are fleeing to the Dniepr river line. Now it is time to eradicate the last german stronghold on the Caucasus, the Kuban bridgehead. The german 17th Army there could, if successfully evacuated, strengthen the german defense in the Crimea or the Ukraine. According to intelligence, the germans will this time not attempt to hold the bridgehead, but will evacuate. Thus, the main task of the VVS will be to interdict the evacuation of men and material across the straits of Kerch. The black Sea fleet will use all its remaining ships to support that operation. The german air units are still weakened from Kursk, while our equipment, training and moral are better than ever!>
<Kubanlate43RuDb> <The Red Banner is flying again over Taman! On the 9th October, the last German has left the Caucasus. Parts of the 17th Army managed to escape, though mostly without material. Also, they are now trapped on the Crimea. The VVS managed to sink a lot of transports, though the Black Sea fleet did not perform as expected and suffered heavy losses. The liberation of the Crimea is next!>
<Kubanlate43RoBr> <After the german offensive at Kursk failed, the entire Ukraine is overrun by the Soviets. It is clear that the Kuban bridgehead has to be evacuated. The AAR will support the evacuation and help to save as many of our soldiers as possible.>
<Kubanlate43RoDb> <The Kuban has been successfully evacuated. The rumanian forces saved there will be used in the defense of the Crimea. The AAR again gave a good account of itself and was especially effective in ground support. The major problem is the beginning of US and British bombing raids on Rumania itself, which leads to a transfer of most rumanian fighter units to home defense.>

<Crimea44DeBr> <In Winter 1943, the Soviets managed to gain a foothold on the Crimea. They hold Kerch and a small bridgehead, but do not have attempted any offensives so far. However, during the general retreat after the failed Kursk offensive, the land connection of the Crimea, the Perekop Isthmus, was occupied by the Soviets. It is obvious that the Soviets will try to conquer all of Crimea this spring. Our forces in the area are scarce. Most of Luftflotte 6 has been withdrawn to Rumania to counter American air raids on Rumanian oil fields. Only II./JG52, parts of SG2 and KG 100 remain in the Crimea to cover the evacuation from Sevastopol. We will have to fight great odds to cover the evacuation fleet.>
<Crimea44DeDb> <The Soviets, attacking with great numbers from both the Perekop and Kerch managed to take all of Crimea except a small pocket around Sevastopol, which managed to hold out a little longer. The German and Rumanian air and naval transports managed to evacuate around 200.000 soldiers from the Crimea, but a lot of ships were sunk. Also, around 100.000 soldiers were left on the Crimea and captured. The small Luftwaffe units fought bravely and destroyed over 600 Soviet planes, but had to leave most of their ground personnel on Crimea. At least we managed to save a lot of soldiers.>
<Crimea44RuBr> <After our winter offensives in 1943, almost all of Ukraine have been liberated and our forces are advancing into Rumania. The Crimea remains occupied by German forces, though we have established a beachhead on Kerch. We will finally take the Crimea in May. German and Rumanian forces are still present on the Island, but an evacuation operation has been launched, both via sea and air routes. The main tasks of the VVS will be not only close support for the ground fighting, but also the interdiction of the evacuation fleet. This will allow us to trap a large number of enemy soldiers.>
<Crimea44RuDb> <The Crimea has been liberated! Sevastopol has fallen after heavy fighting. The VVS was instrumental in this victory. The evacuation fleet suffered heavy losses due to air strikes and our fighters decimated the enemy transport planes. The Luftwaffe was not able to put up much resistance against us this time, but that will surely change in the next battles.>
<Crimea44RoBr> <In winter 1943, the soviets managed to land on Kerch. It is a matter of time when they will launch their final offensive against Sevastopol. When that offensive happens, the royal rumanian Navy and the Kriegsmarine will launch an evacuation effort yet unparalleled in rumanian history. The task of the few rumanian squadrons left on Crimea will be to support the evacuation fleet.>
<Crimea44RoDb> <The crimea has been evacuated, but with heavy losses to the navy and our troops. The remaining forces of the AAR have to fight a two front war - both defending Rumania against US raids and supporting the Front in Bessarabia. It is obvious that we cannot hold out much longer. Whatever the future brings, we have fought well for Rumania!>

<BagrationDeBr> <After the Soviet offensives in the Ukraine, Rumania is now under attack from the Soviets. The Soviets managed to push our forces back from their territory everywhere in the south. Heeresgruppe Mitte holds a huge "front balcony" extending to the Dnepr. A huge building up of Soviet forces in the vicinity suggests that the Soviets will try to take this bulge in their own 1944 summer offensive. The German forces in the bulge cannot hold it. Due to the invasion in the Normandy, much of the mobile forces have been sent westward. The Luftwaffe has the same situation: Many experienced pilots of JG 51, the only fighter unit in the area, have been transferred to the Reichsluftverteidigung. Our forces are hopelessly outnumbered.>
<BagrationDeDb> <On the third anniversary of the attack on the Soviet Union, the Soviet offensive started to crush Heeresgruppe Mitte. Within days, over 300.00 0 German soldiers died or were captured. A disaster larger than Stalingrad. The Luftwaffe was too weak to render any effective resistance. Constant Il-2 attacks on our airfields kept us fighting for our very lives while entire armies died in the field. The whole central East front has collapsed and we don't know how or when we can contain the Soviet breakthrough.>
<BagrationRuBr> <In the third year of this war, the tide has turned. Unlike in the previous years, we will be launching a summer offensive, not the Germans. On the exact anniversary of the German aggression the Red Army will execute Operation Bagratation, a strike at the German occupied part of Belarus. Our aim is to crush the German front and break through into Poland, enabling us to launch attacks both on Hungary and East Prussia. The VVS will massively support this offensive, the main task will be to destroy the Luftwaffe in our sector and the support the offensive.>
<BagrationRuDb> <Operation Bagration has been a huge success! Vitebsk was taken and our forces are still contiuing westward. In the area around Vitebsk, more German soldiers were killed or captured than at Stalingrad. The Luftwaffe was not able to put of any serious resistance and was mostly not even able to defend its own airfields from constant VVS attacks. Except for the Baltics, now all of our Motherland has been liberated from the Germans. Now we will carry the war to them!>

<Lvov44DeBr> <After the disaster around Smolensk and Vitebsk, the remains of Heeresgruppe Mitte are on constant retreat. A holding line has been set up around Lemberg in the southern part of the Soviet advance, but it will not hold very long. We expect the Soviet advance to turn south there and cross the Karpathian Mountains into Hungary. This move would cut off Germany from the oil fields in Rumania and Hungary. Heeresgruppe Sd will support the Royal Hungarian army in the defence of the Hungarian border. Luftflotte 6, supported by units of the RLV, will give air cover alongside the Hungarian air force.>
<Lvov44DeDb> <Lemberg fell after a short time, and the Soviets managed to cross the Carpathians into Hungary. At least we were able to prevent the Hungarians from changing sides. While the Luftwaffe and the Hungarian air force fought well, they were simply overwhelmed by the Soviets.>
<Lvov44RuBr> <After crushing the enemy front in Belarus, our forces are moving westward very quickly. The next target of the Red Army's advance is Lvov. From this city, several armies will turn south and try to force their way over the Carpathian Mountains into Hungary, Debrecen being the first target. The taking of large parts of Hungary will sever the German access to the oil fields of Rumania and Hungary. For that reason, heavy resistance from both Hungarian and German forces can be expected.>
<Lvov44RuDb> <The Red Army successfully took Lvov and managed to cross the Dukla pass over the Carpathians into Hungary. A Hungarian attempt to negotiate a separate peace was crushed by the Germans, turning a satellite state into another occupied country. The Hungarian military however fights on. Once again, the VVS was very successful in supporting the advance and gained air supremacy over both Hungarian and German enemies.>
<Lvov44HuBr> <After the Soviets crushed the German central front, they are in a position to attack Hungary from the north. Even though the Americans heavily bomb Budapest and other cities, the defence of our borders is more important. All available MHKL squadrons will support the defensive battles in the Carpathians.>
<Lvov44HuDb> <The Soviets managed to break into Hungarian territory, despite our and the Luftwaffe's best efforts. A small clique of aristocrats tried to negotiate a separate peace, but the Hungarian military will fight on alongside our German comrades in arms.>

<BerlinDeBr> <The Russian offensive of Summer 44 had pushed us back almost to the 1937 borders of Germany. In February 1945, the Soviets attacked East Prussia. The Kriegsmarine launched an all out effort to save as many soldiers and civilians as possible, and the fighting over a small bridgehead near Pillau is still ongoing, as well as on Hela. The Soviets will soon launch their final offensive on Berlin. After the Ardennes offensive and the failed Operation Bodenplatte, most RLV fighter units have been assigned to the East front, leaving the defence against the US air raids to the Jet fighters of JG 7. Luftflotte 6 has an impressive order of battle, more units ever since Operation Barbarossa. But most units are understrenght, short on fuel and have only novice pilots. The key of success will be the Oder crossings. If we can destroy the Bridges across the Oder, the Soviets will not be able to advance. Gefechtsverband Bohrmann is tasked with that, and all fighter units will support it, as well as fly Jabo missions against Soviet troops. Air supremacy is only a secondary task, due to the huge enemy advantage in numbers. This is going to be our last stand. Especially since the treacherous murder attempt on 20th July last year, the Fhrer expects fanatical resistance and total devotion to duty!>
<BerlinDeDb> <In late February, the Soviets crossed the Oder. An intense air campaign during which every possible weapon was used against the bridges began. However, it proved impossible to destroy the bridges permanently. A last major defensive battle at the Seelower Hhen didn't buy much time and Berlin was surrounded by end of March. The Luftwaffe did what it could, mostly close support missions, but was not able to make any difference. On 2nd May finally, the Fhrer died in his Bunker and the city surrendered. Karl Dnitz, his successor, has build a provisional government in Flensburg and tries to salvage what is possible from the East, but the war is lost. Six years of war and so many lives have been lost in vain.>
<BerlinRuBr> <After successful offensives against East Prussia, Pommerania and Danzig, the Red Army is ready for the final blow against fascism, the assault on Berlin! In late February, several Red Army fronts will cross the Oder River in order to envelop Berlin and take it, preferably with all the German leadership in it. The role of the VVS will be close support for our troops, as well as air cover, especially for the Oder bridges. This will be the last and most important battle of all!>
<BerlinRuDb> <Victory! The red flag has been raised over the Reichstag and Hitler is dead, presumably suicide. The peoples of the Soviet Union have totally defeated the German aggression! We will help the oppressed German people to rebuild their nation as a stable and peaceful country. The VVS, as usual, performed brilliantly in this huge battle. It successfully protected the Oder bridges from German raids and helped eliminate all serious resistance. The VVS has made incredible progress during the war years and was instrumental in winning the war.>

<BalatonDeBr> <Soviet forces surrounded Budapest in February and took it after brutal house fighting. Now, in March, the frontline is just along the southeastern shore of the Plattensee. 1st SS Panzerkorps has been brought up to the front and will launch an offensive aimed at liberating Budapest. Luftflotte 4 and the Hungarian air force will support the Operation Frhlingserwachen. Most important tasks will be close support and escort for our jabos.>
<BalatonDeDb> <Operation Frhlingserwachen didn't get far. Due to mud and rain, the offensive bogged down after a few kilometres and the SS units had to withdraw in order not to get enveloped. A few days later, the Soviets launched their own offensive. Our forces were unable to stop them and by mid April the Soviets crossed the Austrian border and took Vien. Luftflotte 4 and our Hungarian brothers in arms fought bravely, shooting down a large number of Soviet planes. But Soviet and American superiority in numbers was too large to let us make a difference. A few days after Wien, Berlin fell as well. The war is over, and all Luftwaffe units are ordered to fly westward and surrender themselves to the Americans. At least most of us will have a country to return to, unlike our Hungarian comrades. You fought well, all we fought for was in vain.>
<BalatonRuBr> <While our central fronts are converging on Berlin, the Red Army managed to take Budapest, the capital of Germany's last ally. Now in March 1945 the frontline is around lake Balaton and the army is ready to strike further into Austria. The VVS will support this offensive aimed at liberating Austria from German occupation.>
<BalatonRuDb> <The German SS launched a rather weak offensive in mid march, which did not penetrate very far. Immediately afterwards, our own offensive began, quickly sweeping the Germans from Hungary into Austria. Vienna was taken in May, and the triumph of the southern fronts is as complete as the victory at Berlin. The VVS fought brilliantly against the Luftwaffe's last gasp and came out victorious again. Our complete victory over fascism was to a large part due to the VVS.>

<BalatonHuBr> <Budapest has fallen after a brutal battle, and the Soviets have conquered most of our country. Still, we have to do our duty as soldiers of the Royal Hungarian army. We will fight alongside the Luftwaffe until the last man. Yet, there is hope: the German elite 1. SS Panzerkorps will launch an offensive to liberate Budapest. I expect all of you to give your utmost in this desperate battle.>
<BalatonHuDb> <The offensive of the SS has failed after a few days and the Soviets have pushed the Germans back to the Austrian border. Sopron was the last Hungarian city to fall into their hands. Our country is again in the hands of the Bolsheviks and the Red terror of 1919 will return. At least we have shown the world how royal Hungarian soldiers fight and have done our duty. But our country is lost for us and we will have to go into exile.>

<Finland41FiBr> <After the Soviets have bombed Helsinki on 25th June, Marshal Mannerheim decided to join the war on the German side in order to regain the East Karelian territories the soviets had grabbed after the winter war of 1939. The army will soon launch an offensive to liberate our territories in East Karelia. The task of the ILV will be not only the protection of Helsinki from the air, but also cover for our troops.>
<Finland41FiDb> <The Germans so far have failed to take Leningrad, but have put the city under a devastating siege and heavy air attacks. We have accomplished all goals of our war, but while 200.000 reservists are demobilized, a state of war still exists with the Soviet union, even if actual combat is limited to air combat and static warfare in front of Leningrad. We will hold the front and wait how the general situation of the German-Russian war develops before entering peace negotiations on our terms with the Soviets.>

<Leningrad41DeBr> <After difficult battles in the Baltic states and around the Ilmensee, Heeresgruppe Nord is advancing towards Tallinn and finally Leningrad. With our Finnish allies closing in on the Karelian front, Leningrad is to be totally cut off from the rest of the Soviet Union. Luftflotte 1, under command of Generaloberst Keller, is tasked with air operations over the Gulf of Finland and its military strongholds. The fighters are to win air supremacy while Stukas and Bombers will systematically attack the defensive emplacements, as well as interdict the supply shipping. Another primary target is the Red Banner Baltic fleet, which is based at Kronstadt. Luftflotte 1 will attack and destroy these ships in order to prevent their breakout to neutral Sweden.>
<Leningrad41RuBr> <A few days ago, the German forces have attacked the Soviet Union! So far, the Germans are advancing into the Lithuanian SSR and it is very likely that the final goal of the northern thrust is Leningrad, but the situation is even worse: The rulers of Finland are known to seek a revision of the 1940 peace treaty. A Finnish attack is very likely and preparations have to be made for a two front war at the Leningrad front. Leningrad PVO, Baltic fleet VVS and the northern front VVS will have to defend Leningrad and the front, while the DBA will execute pre-emptive strikes against Finnish military and political targets.>
<Leningrad41FiBr> <After the Soviets have bombed Helsinki on 25th June, Marshal Mannerheim decided to join the war on the German side in order to regain the East Karelian territories the soviets had grabbed after the winter war of 1939. The army will soon launch an offensive to liberate our territories in East Karelia. The task of the ILV will be not only the protection of Helsinki from the air, but also cover for our troops.>

<Leningrad41DeDb> <Our air war against Leningrad has not been totally successful. While our fighters, skillfully led by Major Trautloft, are ruling the skies, strong Soviet flak as made bombing raids on Leningrad very difficult. Especially the attacks on the Baltic fleet didn't have the expected success. Though some ships were sunk, the bulk of the fleet is still operational and remains a threat. Our ground troops also so far have failed to make more gains against the defensive emplacements and trench warfare reminiscent of the last war has developed in front of Leningrad. Isolating the city will also get more and more difficult in the winter when the Soviets will be able to supply the city via the frozen Ladogasee.>
<Leningrad41RuDb> <The Germans have failed to take Leningrad, but we are under siege and a terrible famine has broken out in the city. We must hope the supply situation gets better when Lake Ladoga is frozen and usable for truck traffic. The VVS and PVO regiments have fought heroically in the skies over Leningrad, preventing larger German terror raids and protecting the Red Banner Baltic fleet from being annihilated from the air. While doing so, they air regiments have taken heavily losses. For the upcoming counteroffensives, the VVS and PVO of Leningrad will have to be rebuild.>
<Leningrad41FiDb> <The Germans so far have failed to take Leningrad, but have put the city under a devastating siege and heavy air attacks. We have accomplished all goals of our war, but while 200.000 reservists are demobilized, a state of war still exists with the Soviet union, even if actual combat is limited to air combat and static warfare in front of Leningrad. We will hold the front and wait how the general situation of the German-Russian war develops before entering peace negotiations on our terms with the Soviets.>

<Leningrad42DeBr> <After the difficult battles at Demyansk and Volkhov, the siege ring around Leningrad has been closed again. The only supply route for the city is the Ladogasee. During winter, the Soviets are sending truck convoys over the ice and during summer, ships delivering supplies. Luftflotte 1 has the grim mission of keeping the pressure on Leningrad, both by maintaining air supremacy and striking at Soviet industry and supplies.>
<Leningrad42RuBr> <The efforts by the Red Army to re-establish the land connection to Leningrad have failed. The city still is in a difficult position, even though the supplies brought in via Lake Ladoga are now barely sufficient to sustain the civilians and soldiers in Leningrad. The main task of the VVS will for the next time will be to keep the city alive. For this, we have to protect our supply routes from air attacks, strike at the German positions and protect the city itself.>
<Leningrad42FiBr> <While we have re-established the pre 1940 borders and have demobilized many reservists, a state of war continues to exist between the Soviets and us. For that reason, we must keep the pressure on them to prevent Soviet offensives. The Finnish air force's task is to maintain air supremacy north of Leningrad and on the Karelian front.>

<Leningrad42DeDb> <Leningrad is still under siege. We have fortified our emplacements, but it is well possible that the Russians will attempt another breakout operation this winter. The baltic fleet has been struck again, but is still operational. The fighters of JG 54 are still ruling the skies, but soviet air strenght is increasing. The soviet air force in Leningrad is especially strenghthened by planes from the US or England.>
<Leningrad42RuDb> <The Germans have so far failed to make any gains against Leningrad. The Germans have also failed in sinking any more ships of the Baltic fleet. Enemy landing operations on the islands in Lake Ladoga have been repulsed. The route over the lake is secure for now. In next winter, the red army is ready for another attempt to open a land route to Leningrad.>
<Leningrad42FiDb> <The Germans have failed to take Leningrad so far, and the siege is holding. The conditions in the city must be terrible. Yet the siege of Leningrad is instrumental in keeping the soviets from attacking Finland again. We must keep the pressure on the Soviets.>

<Leningrad43DeBr> <During the last days, the sovies have started to attack the positions of our 18th army at the souther shore of the Ladogasee, near Schlsselburg. The attack is aimed at opening a land corridor to the city. We will not be able to keep the siege if the soviets can resupply by land. Luftflotte 1 must undertake a maximum effort to support our ground forces. >
<Leningrad43RuBr> <Operation Iskra, the relief offensive for Leningrad, is about to begin! The VVS on the Karelian and Leningrad front will support 2nd Shock army and 67th army in their move against the german salient near Shlisselburg. The enemy air forces are weaker than previous year, as the germans have withdrawn some forces westward and the finnish have assumed a defensive posture.>
<Leningrad43FiBr> <The Soviets are preparing for another offensive to relieve Leningrad. Their forces are ready to strike a german position south of Ladoga. The siege of Leningrad will be very difficult to maintain when the russians can open a land corridor. We must support the germans in the defense of the Schlsselburg salient. >

<Leningrad43DeDb> <After almost two years, the pressure from Soviet units inside Leningrad is growing, Luftflotte 1 is more and more forced to a defensive stance. While the air units have performed brilliantly, the Luftflotte has been forced to give a lot of units to other theaters and fronts. For that reason, our strength has decreased while the enemy is stronger than ever. We enter the third year with an uncertain future ahead...>
<Leningrad43RuDb> <Leningrad has been through two terrible years, but the worst is over now. The Red Army and VVS defending the city are stronger than ever and everything is ready for breaking out of the siege. The VVS was instrumental in keeping Leningrad alive for two years. It fought the best German pilots, it protected the supply routes and now has turned offensive against German airfields and positions.>
<Leningrad43FiDb> <During the last two years, the ILV has fought very well, but Soviet air strength has increased severely. Even with the new 109s from Germany, we are simply outnumbered by the Soviets. It is very likely that the Soviets will attempt to break out of the siege of Leningrad soon. And after that, it is only a matter of time until they attack Finland again.>

<Leningrad44DeBr> <This morning, the Baltic fleet has commenced a heavy bombardment of our forward positions at Oranienbaum! The Soviets are breaking out of Leningrad! Luftflotte 1 must support the ground forces on their retreat and help the establishment of a new defensive line near Narva. The VVS is stronger than ever, but we still have qualitative superiority.>
<Leningrad44RuBr> <This morning, our comrades of the Baltic fleet have started to bombard the German siege positions! The time is there to end the siege of Leningrad! The VVS will support the offensive. Our main task will be to  destroy the Luftwaffe's bases and cover the advance of our troops. If this offensive succeeds, the entire Baltic and Finland may soon be liberated as well!>
<Leningrad44FiBr> <The Soviets have broken out of the Siege of Leningrad in January and have reconquered most of the Baltic states. Reconnaissance has revealed a huge Soviet build-up at our borders. It is only a matter of time until the Soviets will attack us and this time we might not be able to stop them. The ILV must defend our cities and protect our ground forces.>

<Leningrad44RuDb> <Leningrad is free again! We have broken the siege and the Red Army is rapidly advancing in the Baltic republics. Narva has fallen and Tallinn will fall soon. The German forces are regrouping in the south and are forming a pocket, which we will have to eliminate in the next time. Also, our offensive in Karelia has been a huge success, we have re-established the 1940 border and the Finns have signed an honorable peace with us. Two bitter years of hunger and suffering are over for the people of Leningrad!>
<Leningrad44DeDb> <The siege positions around Leningrad, shell-shocked by the massive bombardment, have been totally overrun. The new defensive line at Narva did not hold very long and it is only a matter of time until the Soviets take Tallinn. Luftflotte 1 will withdraw to Kurland to cover our forces there.>
<Leningrad44FiDb> <In June, the Soviet offensive finally struck. Two Soviet armies, with over 200.000 men and thousands of tanks, supported by a huge air fleet, have attacked us. The ILV and the Germans have fought bravely, shooting down 800 planes, but were not able to keep air supremacy. With massive German help, we were able to stop the Soviet offensive just on the 1940 border, but we cannot maintain this line for long. We have to negotiate for peace or the very existence of our country will be at stake.>
