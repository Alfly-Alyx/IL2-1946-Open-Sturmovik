*(GC II/5) Squadron "Lafayette": France-USA friendship.
Dynamic campaign for a French Arm\u00E9e de l'Air fighter pilot between 1943 and 1945. \n \nUpon his arrival in Casablanca, French Morocco in November 1942, USAAF colonel Harold Willis was astonished: he discovered on the fuselages of the French Curtiss H-75As based in Casablanca, the emblem of the Indian Sioux head he initiated himself! \nIn December 1916, Harold Willis was a young fighter pilot and one of the "flyboys" of Escadrille Lafayette. His group was small. Like other volunteers, he was an idealist, believing that America ought to be grateful to France, the home of human rights, who helped his nation to become independent in the 18th century. He himself contributed to the design of the Sioux head symbol! How could he forget about his French friends? \nVery quickly, almost 30 years after WWI, history reversed itself: after France equipped an American squadron under French command over Verdun and the Somme, now Americans would rearm French squadrons under US command...\nToday, the insignia of the Sioux head is still well alive: the Mirage 2000Ns of the Lafayette squadron display it on their tails...\nHow about you? Will you honor the cause of Raoul Lufbery? \n \nRecommended skin for the P-47D-22 (markings OFF): $zargos-p47d-22-gc2.5-cigognes-n38.bmp \n \nRecommended skins for the P-47D-27 (markings OFF): $zargos-p47d27-lafayette-9V-D-v2.bmp or $zargos-p47d27-lafayette-9V-D-v1.bmp  \n \nRecommended skins for the P-47D (markings OFF): $zargos-p47d27-lafayette-9V-E.bmp or $zargos-p47d27-lafayette-9V-A.bmp
