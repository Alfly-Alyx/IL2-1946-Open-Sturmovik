*(GR I/33) Reconnaissance Group "Belfort".
Dynamic campaign for a French reconnaissance pilot over France, North Africa and Germany, between 1940 and 1945.\n\nAfter the Phoney War, you will participate in the Battle of France. Then after retreating to North Africa, you will witness the allied landings during Operation Torch. Under the command of Colonel Eliott Roosevelt, you will then join a French reconnaissance group, the first escadrille of the II/33 integrated into the 3rd Photographic Group. Later in 1945, the first escadrille will then become the I/33.\n \nAntoine de Saint-Exup\u00E9ry, the famous French aviator and writer, made this reconnaissance group known worldwide through his best-seller "Flight to Arras". Your group was one of the first ones from the Arm\u00E9e de l'Air to be reequipped with American aircraft. To thank them for their cooperation, please make our American friends happy and bring back valuable photographs!\n \nRecommended skin for the P-38J (markings OFF): $F-5_Saint-Exupery.bmp
