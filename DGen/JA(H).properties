Description Some time later...\n\n\nThe news arrived this morning.\n\n"Japan has decided to accept the enemy's terms. We will abide by the Potsdam Declaration."\n\nA message to the nation, recorded by The Emperor himself, will be broadcast through NHK tomorrow at noon.\n\nSurrender..?\n\nAugust 14,1945 18:00 hours\n\n{FULLRANK} {LASTNAME}, you have made a bold decision and will defy the order to remain grounded.\n\nNo announcement has been broadcast publicly yet, so in effect the war is still on.\n\nOne last flight then...\nMaybe you can make one final interception in your Zero and claim a kill in the name of the Emperor.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you find yourself outnumbered and die in battle, then at least your passing will be honourable like that of the Samurai.\n\nBanzai!\n
