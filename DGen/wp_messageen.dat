		 Translation guidelines. 

	Every line not starting with symbol < will be ignored. You may use it for comments.
 	Otherwise every message consists of two parts: message ID and Message text,
	both in < > brackets.

	For every ID code there may be up to 10 variants of texts - one will be picked up randomly.
	You don't need to translate every line exactly, you just need to describe the same situation.

	Symbols \n and %s must be left intact. \n means new line, %s means that some substring will be 
	placed there - usually town name. Some lines have space in the end. Please leave it in place -
	it means that there will be another sentence that will continue the briefing. The space separates them. 

	Message texts cannot contain new lines - make them as long as you need (but not longer than 256 chars).

<BerlinPlBr> <The first Polish aviation units in the Soviet Union commenced training in 1943 and the first sturmovik regiment was finally ready for combat in August 1944. After liberating East Prussia, Pomorze and Gdansk, the Polish People's Army, fighting along with the Red Army is ready for the final blow against hitlerists, the assault on Berlin! In late February, several Red Army fronts including 1st Polish Army will cross the Odra River in order to envelop Berlin and take it, preferably with all the German leadership in it. The role of the Polish People's Army Aviation and VVS will be close support for our troops, as well as air cover, especially for the Odra bridges. This will be the last and most important battle of all!>
<BerlinPlDb> <Victory! The red flag has been raised over the Reichstag and Hitler is dead! The peoples of the Soviet Union along with their Polish allies have totally defeated the German aggressor! At last Poland is free! The hitlerist occupation is over. The Polish People's Army Aviation, teamed up with VVS, performed brilliantly in this huge battle. It successfully protected the Odra bridges from German raids and helped eliminate all serious resistance. Polish People's Army Aviation has made incredible progress during the war years growing from a single eskadra to a full fledged air force and proved that it was important factor in toppling the Nazi regime.>
<BerlinDeBr> <The Russian offensive of Summer 44 had pushed us back almost to the 1937 borders of Germany. In February 1945, the Soviets attacked East Prussia. The Kriegsmarine launched an all out effort to save as many soldiers and civilians as possible, and the fighting over a small bridgehead near Pillau is still ongoing, as well as on Hela. The Soviets will soon launch their final offensive on Berlin. After the Ardennes offensive and the failed Operation Bodenplatte, most RLV fighter units have been assigned to the East front, leaving the defence against the US air raids to the Jet fighters of JG 7. Luftflotte 6 has an impressive order of battle, more units ever since Operation Barbarossa. But most units are understrenght, short on fuel and have only novice pilots. The key of success will be the Oder crossings. If we can destroy the Bridges across the Oder, the Soviets will not be able to advance. Gefechtsverband Bohrmann is tasked with that, and all fighter units will support it, as well as fly Jabo missions against Soviet troops. Air supremacy is only a secondary task, due to the huge enemy advantage in numbers. This is going to be our last stand. Especially since the treacherous murder attempt on 20th July last year, the Führer expects fanatical resistance and total devotion to duty!>
<BerlinDeDb> <In late February, the Soviets crossed the Oder. An intense air campaign during which every possible weapon was used against the bridges began. However, it proved impossible to destroy the bridges permanently. A last major defensive battle at the Seelower Höhen didn't buy much time and Berlin was surrounded by end of March. The Luftwaffe did what it could, mostly close support missions, but was not able to make any difference. On 2nd May finally, the Führer died in his Bunker and the city surrendered. Karl Dönitz, his successor, has build a provisional government in Flensburg and tries to salvage what is possible from the East, but the war is lost. Six years of war and so many lives have been lost in vain.>
