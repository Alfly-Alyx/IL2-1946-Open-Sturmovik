I. Installation
---------------

This speech pack is meant to be placed in a sub-folder of the install folder of "Forgotten Battles". The full path should be  SAMPLES/SPEECH/FR. The installation should go like this :

1. Create a folder named FR within the sub-folder SAMPLES/SPEECH (it should be next to other folders such as : DE, FI, HU, RU et US)
2. Unzip the files of the zipped file in this folder (make sure the option "keep subfolders" of your unzippinf software is activated)

You should get a set of sub-folders created within the FR folder : Actor1, Actor2, ..., Actor9. Those folders should hold many WAV files.

II. Using the files
-------------------

This speech pack is meant to introduce French voices in Il2 "Forgotten Battles". In fact, it is designed to portray the voice comms of fighter group Normandie (to become Normandie-Niemen). This is why call-signs are "Rayack", messages begin with par "Allo", because these are the historically correct messages.

Moreover, we have some bomber pilots voices. For them, we used the "Bretagne" (Brittany) call-sign. This bomber group was meant to be sent in Russia to fight alongside with the Normandie fighters. In fact, they never went to USSR.

In order to have some French voices displayed, the mission must have some french pilots flying. So, with the full mission builder, you must give French nationality to some flights. It is so if you use the Normandie-Niemen squadron.

You will notice that the radio comms between the control and those flights will be in French too. This is perfectly historically correct !


IV. Designers notes
-------------------

Voices displayed in the speech pack have different accents. We used a large panel, in order to have as many French accents as possible. 

We also modified slightly the structure of the messages. You will notice that some "void" messages. The words of this messages rae included within other messages. We believe that this gave much more "life" to the messages and the whole set. Some messages were slightly altered in their content, in order to stick better to the situation described and it should give a better sense of immersion. That's why some messages are not 100% compliant with their translation. Anyway, they are perfectly accurate, in relation with the situation described.

As was said before, call-signs are those of the Normandie-Niemen. We could have chosen otherwise, but the restricted structure of the messages did not allow for a better portraying of several patrols and flights. We had to refrain ourselves quite a bit...

We did not use the "number codes" of the VVS (Soviet air forces), although they were widely used in the real Normandie radio comms.
