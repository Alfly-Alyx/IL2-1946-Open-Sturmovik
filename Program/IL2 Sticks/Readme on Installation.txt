July 2005. IL2-Sticks, Version 1.0h Beta!

Utility to change the sensitivity settings for your HOTAS controllers, and thus optimize your simflying experience!

This IL2-Sticks utility does not have any special Installation procedure (ie Setup.exe)

It should work, as long as you create a folder, place (extract) all files from the zipfile into the folder, and make sure the folder has a subfolder called 'Profiles'
There will be no icons created, neither on the desktop, nor in the Start Menu. 
Create one yourself, or just doubleclick on IL2-Sticks.exe to start it.

Disclaimer:
* This tool has been tested, but tests have been limited! (And only for IL2 FB-AEP-PF 4.01m)
* Using this program is at your own risk! 
* The maker of this program does not guarantee it's functionality.
* The maker will not accept any responsibility for any effects it may have on your hardware/software!

Have Fun!
