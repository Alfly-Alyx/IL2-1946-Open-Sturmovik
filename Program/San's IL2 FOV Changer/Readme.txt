Release Candidate Version Notes:

- Joystick support. Axis support for absolute fov changes and button support for relative fov changes. In both cases the fov in/out is smoother than with keys.
- Test config button to help people to config the program.
- Auto detects ip
- Now the program stores internally the mac, so you don´t have to change the ip if you have dynamic address.
- Watch fov, the program follows IL2 when it jumps before you need it.
- Very faster start (less than one second)
- Lot of new possible keys, but with joystick support who wants it!
- The joystick support code is based in a code from Mark Harris (Australia)

Install
- Extract the zip where do you want but be carefull that San's_IL2_FovChanger_RC.exe, pref.ini and Microsoft.DirectX.DirectInput.dll are in the same path.
- Execute San's_IL2_FovChanger_RC.exe

There are two pref.ini
- Default "pref.ini" is stable in all the systems.
- "Quick pref.ini" is faster (140 ms in my system) but is not stable in all the systems. If you want to try it rename "pref.ini" to "pref.ini2" and
	"Quick pref.ini" to "pref.ini" and relaunch the application.

Don't modify start and end point.
