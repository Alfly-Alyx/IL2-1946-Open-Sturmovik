This file is used for customizing some minor features of the plane by binding them to certain BMP skin. 
To enable some feature, put the skin's checksum under certain tag. To find out the checksum, clear skin cache
at PaintSchemes\Cache, start the game, load skin and alt-tab back to Windows. Now cache folder has a new folder
named with long series of numbers. This is the checksum.
