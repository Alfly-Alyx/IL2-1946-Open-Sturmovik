Your target is the Naval barracks on the Oroku Peninsula, south of Naha.  Our intelligence suggests that this peninsula is primarily defended by Imperial Navy troops, who as you know enjoy a tough reputation.\n\nIt's likely most of the soldiers posted to these barracks have now been dispersed, but let's smash these buildings anyhow.  It deprives the enemy of a focal point for their organisation and morale.\n\nGet back in plenty of time, as you've still got lots more work to do before you turn in this evening.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1615\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 20 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1620\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Overcast\nCloud: 7/10\nWind: Moderate from South\nAmbient temp. 75 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 2 x 500lb HE\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
