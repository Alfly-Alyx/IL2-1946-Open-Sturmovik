Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++VMF-112+++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n1 April 1945 (Love-Day)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nOperational Briefing 4/01/45/178\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCirculation: Relevant Personnel\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nOur landings have been an incredible success, with little or no enemy opposition encountered so far.  The expertise we have built up in all of our amphibious operations in the Pacific has paid of handsomely this morning.  Incredibly, there are even reports that our total casualties up to H+3 may not have exceeded double figures.\n\nThat said, the Japs have finally wised up to our Minatoga ruse.  Their initial air response was directed toward the southern demonstration, and I'm sorry to report that a couple of troop ships were hit by Kamikazes.  Now, however, we are starting to see increased enemy aerial activity over Hagushi.  Our response has to be firm and decisive.\n\nYou will patrol over the beachhead, and repel any enemy intruders.  Most of them will be on a one-way trip, so make sure you deal with them as quickly and clinically as you can.  Any hesitation or error may quickly result in the loss of mens' lives.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1105\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 15 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1115\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Overcast\nCloud: 5/10\nWind: Calm\nAmbient temp. 74 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: N/A\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
