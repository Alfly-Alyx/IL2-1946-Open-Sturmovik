Whether these are fishing operations, or the inter-island transportation of personnel and equipment we are unable to ascertain.  Nonetheless we are obliged to intercept and neutralise any such activity.\n\nGo take a look around the coast around Aha, and strike any waterborne craft you can identify.  Report back any activity that you see.\n\nOn a defensive note, Japanese air activity has become steadily more active.  Snoopers have given way to occasional solo suicide attacks during the night.  We suspect these types of intrusion are mainly psychological in intent, though evidence is equally suggesting that these may be attempts to destroy picket vessels and other early-warning assets that we possess.\n\nOur gunners are running on a hair-trigger, and there's nothing to suggest the Japs want to make it any easier on them.  You can help by remembering to activate your IFF whenever you are in proximity to the fleet.  We're going to get it tough, but let's make it as easy on ourselves as possible.\n\nMay God go with you.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0430\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 40 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0445\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Overcast\nCloud: 6/10\nWind: Moderate from West\nAmbient temp. 55 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 8 x HVAR\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 3/4 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
