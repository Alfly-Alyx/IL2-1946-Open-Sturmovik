We got another attack coming in.  Don't hang around on the deck, just get up there as soon as you can.\n\nWe're gonna try to take some of the strain off the gunners, who have been having a torrid time throughout this operation.  We lost one of the gunners on "D" Battery after the attack this morning.  Word is that he just turned to his loaders, said "Gee, it's hot today" and jumped off the side.  Search teams didn't even manage to find the body.\n\nBut let's not forget the strain on the enemy.  As I'm sure you've noticed, they've been throwing an increasing number of obsolescent planes into these attacks.  The attrition works both ways, gentlemen, so let's make sure we extract a maximum price for these attacks.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0955\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 10 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0955\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Overcast\nCloud: 7/10\nWind: Moderate from NW\nAmbient temp. 70 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: N/A\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/4 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
