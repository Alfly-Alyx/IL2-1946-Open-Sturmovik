This time we hope it'll be the Japs who are the fools, as we're planning to decoy them into believing the landing's on the southeast beaches near Minatoga.  That's where there'll be a dummy landing simultaneous with ours.\n\nOur landing is the real deal.  The Marines' IIIAC will be landing to north of the Bishi Gawa, with Hagushi at the southern end of their line.  The Army's XXIV Corps will land on the southern side.  You're going to assist the Army in their task by destroying the bridge south of Chatan.  This will help secure 96th Division's right flank, and hinder enemy attempts to invest their beachhead.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0755\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 10 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0800\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Clear\nCloud: 2/10\nWind: Light from SE\nAmbient temp. 73 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 2 x 500lb HE\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
