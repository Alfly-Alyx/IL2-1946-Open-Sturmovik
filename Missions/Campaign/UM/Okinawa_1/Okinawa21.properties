Next up, you're going to partake in a joint strike with VBF-83 on the bridges north of Naha.  These are primary transport and communications links for the island's defenders, so their severence will significantly degrade the enemy's strategic flexibility.  This is a quick in-and-out mission, so I want no heroics.\n\nThe Japanese nuisance raids are getting so frequent now, we haven't got time to re-schedule any further missions.  You're just going to have to fight your way to the target as and when necessary.  Naval fighters will attempt to clear the way for you on this occasion.  Once that's done, press on with your mission.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0910\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 25 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0920\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Good\nCloud: 3/10\nWind: Moderate from South\nAmbient temp. 68 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 2 x 500lb HE\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
