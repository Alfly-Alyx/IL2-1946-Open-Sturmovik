Your target is a bridge on the main trunk route from the Yaeju Dake to Shuri.\n\nWe believe these are the two main enemy defensive organisational positions, and so this route is of major strategic importance to enemy force disposition.\n\nThe more we can inconvenience the Japanese in their rear areas, the greater chance we have of hindering any effective response to our landings.  These strikes are aimed at reducing enemy flexibility and co-ordination.  I trust you to ensure they are successful.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1830\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 25 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1840\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Poor\nCloud: 5/10\nWind: Brisk from North\nAmbient temp. 61 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 2 x 500lb HE\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
