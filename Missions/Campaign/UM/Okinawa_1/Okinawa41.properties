We've got a BIG wave of enemy coming in.  This appears to be a concerted attempt to stop us supporting our shore operations by causing maximum destruction to the fleet.\n\nEveryone of these air battles will be decisive.  It is imperative that combined operations proceed with as little reduction in tempo as possible.  The Japs can fail to stop us any number of times and still try again.  We can't afford to fail even once.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0445\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 15 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0455\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Clear\nCloud: 1/10\nWind: Mild from NE\nAmbient temp. 57 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: N/A\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
