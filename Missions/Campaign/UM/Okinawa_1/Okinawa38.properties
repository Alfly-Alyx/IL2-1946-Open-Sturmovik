This need is accelerated by the fact that our ground forces are encountering their first significant enemy opposition, as we move south from the Chatan Peninsula.\n\nIntelligence garnered from prisoners has indicated that the Hagushi landing area was only being protected by a covering force of second-line troops and the "Boeitai", the Okinawan local militia.  Now though, 96th Division is meeting disciplined first-line troops.  That would be tough enough, but the rains have impaired logistics supply as the roads to the front have become mudslides.\n\nYou will escort TBM's to their objective - the enemy pocket on "Castle Hill".  This strike is to support 3/381, who will follow our air action with a ground assault.  If you engage any targets of opportunity, be sure to identify them as hostile before pressing your attack.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1530\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 15 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1535\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Cloudy\nCloud: 5/10\nWind: Moderate from South\nAmbient temp. 71 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: N/A\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
