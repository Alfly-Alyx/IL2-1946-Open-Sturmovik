NGF is being suspended for an air strike on the landing beaches.  Your target is the village of Sunabe in XXIV Corp's zone.\n\nOnce all you boys are back, NGF will resume, with the emphasis on smoke cover for the assault waves.  Enemy response has so far been minimal, which is only adding to our sense of trepidation.  The only thing worse than a screaming, fanatical Jap is a quiet one that's reluctant yet to show himself.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0705\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 10 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0710\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Poor visibility\nCloud: 6/10\nWind: Calm\nAmbient temp. 66 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 2 x 500lb HE\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
