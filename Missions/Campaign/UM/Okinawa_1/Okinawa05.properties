Task Force 58's strikes on the Japanese mainland have given us reasonable respite from Imperial air elements, so let's make good this situation by hitting our designated targets, and then go looking for some others.  \n\nThe more damage we do during this stage of the operation, the more chance we have of getting those grunts and leathernecks on the landing beaches safely.  The paralysis of the enemy's defensive organisation remains our overriding priority.\n\nYou boys are doing a great job, but I reserve the right to keep asking more of you.  Target for this morning is Shuri Castle.  We believe that this is the enemy's main organisational centre.  It's an ancient Okinawan palace that has been reinforced and studded with countless intricate defensive positions.  It's not the kind of structure that's going to fall down easily, so maximum High Explosive is on Marine Aviation's menu.\n\nYou're carrying some big eggs on this mission, so make sure you instruct your armorer to set a long fuse.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nHeavy Load Take Off Drill\n-----------------------------------\n\nExtend wings\nLock tail wheel\nSet flaps to take off position\nSet rudder trim 10 clicks to starboard\nSet elevator trim nose up.\nSet radiator closed\nSet full power + WEP\nRelease chocks\nRetract undercarriage the instant you leave the deck\nWhen you stabilise at the bottom of the drop, retract flaps immediately\n(Power down and open rads when appropriate)\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0600\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 35 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0610\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Poor visibility\nCloud: 8/10\nWind: Moderate from SW\nAmbient temp. 59 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 2 x 1000lb HE\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
