Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++VMF-112+++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n1 April 1945 (Love-Day)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nOperational Briefing 4/01/45/289\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCirculation: Relevant Personnel\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nPicket ships are reporting another attack coming in on the landing beaches.  These attacks have so far all been suiciders, so there's no reason to think this one will be any different.  We want you to help the ground forces in driving them off.\n\nAs you will no doubt be aware we captured Yontan and Kadena airfields this morning without incident.  The Seabees have been filling the runways all afternoon, so both fields are now open for emergency landings should they be required.\n\nTenth Army have landed on Okinawa pretty much in one piece and in good order.  We're organising the beachhead so that 200,000 men can push forward with all the logisitical support necessary.  We can all take credit for that.  So let's not let a few fanatical Japanese airmen spoil our momentum.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1735\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 15 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1740\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Hazy\nCloud: 5/10\nWind: Calm\nAmbient temp. 76 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: N/A\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
