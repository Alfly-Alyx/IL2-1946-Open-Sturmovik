At Waypoint 6 check in on the picket vessel at bearing 091.  Those poor guys get lonely and scared out there on their own.  The Japs are bad enough, but meterological reports are indicating incoming storms, so we're going to intensively patrol before the weather closes us down.\n\nIt's unlucky for us because our progress on the ground has been outstanding.  We've already taken objectives we thought would take us a week to acquire.  I know we're all asking where the Japs are, and some of us have been hoping they've made a big mistake by concentrating their forces on Formosa.  \n\nWell, information that's been passed on by Intelligence from the local Okinawans suggests that the Japs have concentrated in the south.  Just how strongly they are concentrated has yet to be revealed.  But let's just thank God for the deliverance he has granted us so far.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1310\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 45 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1325\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Hazy\nCloud: 5/10\nWind: Light from North\nAmbient temp. 71 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: N/A\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: Full Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
