This time your target is the defensive installations positioned around the town itself.\n\nThe Japanese are masters at constructing hidden positions from natural geographical features.  As you have seen from our reconnaissance photos, anything that catches your eye, or seems out of place, is likely to be an embedded enemy emplacement.\n\nIf anything down there arouses your suspicion, use your ordnance to confirm your curiosity.  Also look out for enemy road traffic.  As Shuri is such an important communications centre for the enemy, it's the one place where you're likely to find him out in the open.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0815\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 20 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0820\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Balmy, Mild haze\nCloud: 3/10\nWind: Light from NW\nAmbient temp. 80 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 8 x 5" HVAR + 2 x 500lb HE\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
