Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++VMF-112+++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n7 April 1945 (Love+6)\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nOperational Briefing 4/07/45/0100\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCirculation: Relevant Personnel\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nIt looks like the enemy air attack has at last abated.  We took some grevious blows, but so did the enemy.  We estimate that he expended about 300 planes in the entire attack.\n\nOn our side Hancock is still burning from the Kami she took yesterday evening.  It's always hell watching another ship suffering and being helpless to assist.  Our picket vessels also took a hammering from the suicide rockets the gunners are starting to call "Bakas", or "fool bombs".  We've uncovered a couple at Yontan airfield, and are being examing them now, with a hope to giving us a method of combatting them......\n\nWe're back on Strike assignment for the next mission, and the target is in IIIAC's sector, just south of Nago.  Target will be phospherus-marked in the familiar way.\n\nWe will be carrying three 500lb bombs.  The first click on the bomb trigger will release the wing-mounted bombs, and the second click will release the one on the centreline.  Make sure none of them go wasted.  Ground forces will be following our attack, so they're not gonna be happy if we bring our ordnance home with us.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0930\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 25 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0940\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Good\nCloud: 3/10\nWind: Calm\nAmbient temp. 79 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 3 x 500lb.
