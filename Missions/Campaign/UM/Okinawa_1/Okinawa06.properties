These will no doubt prove invaluable during the long struggle ahead.\n\nYou've no doubt been hearing some of the dark rumors that have been coming from those islands.  Well to confirm one rumor, yes a large number of suicide boats have been recovered from various camouflaged hideouts.  These number approximately 350 small vessels.  From what we hear, we needn't have been too concerned about them anyway, as they were poorly constructed and of dubious seaworthiness.  Nevertheless, they have now been put permanently out of commission.\n\nI'm sorry to report that the other rumor of a large number of native civilian suicides is also true.  It appears that the Imperial authorities convinced these innocent islanders that we would treat them with utmost barbarity on our arrival.  Our ground forces have located a number of  "death pits" where whole families have been slaughtered, usually by the head of the household.  As you can imagine, it has proven no consolation to the survivors  that our medical teams have been compassionately trying to save however few lives they can.\n\nLet these incidents serve as an example of  the ruthlessness and deceit of the Imperial Japanese authorities.  Sadly, we can only expect more of this, and on a greater scale, when we land on Okinawa proper.\n\nIf we ourselves have one stroke of  fortune, it's that we're flying above all this.  So let's get on with the job.  This afternoon, you will be conducting a CAP to the northeast of the island.  This will be a patrol in strength with Navy fighter squadrons 83 and 84.  Keep a keen eye out for inbound bogeys.  They're likely to be on a one-way trip, so you won't  get a second bite at them.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1400\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 50 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1415\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Clear\nCloud: 5/10\nWind: Moderate from SE\nAmbient temp. 74 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: N/A\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: Full Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
