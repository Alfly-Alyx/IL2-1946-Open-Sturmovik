Our participation in ICEBERG commences right of this moment.  Our target for this morning is the Kerama Retto, which, if you look at your maps, is a series of islets 15 nautical miles to the west of Okinawa.\n\nWe need to grab these islands quick, because they constitute a series of natural harbors where we can anchor those elements of the fleet that require maintenance, refuelling, or are engaged in supply.\n\nThe Grunts of the 77th ID have been tasked with taking these islands, and we in turn have been tasked with softening up the opposition before they hit the beaches.  This whole operation is all about combined forces.  I know we don't always see eye-to-eye, but to be successful we need to build up real team work with the Army and Navy.\n\nAnd that means that our first objective is to build up the confidence of those Army boys in Marine Aviation.  How are we going to do that?  By you guys getting in low and blasting anything that opens up on those boats.  You're going to put on a good show early; then you're going to keep it up for the rest of this operation.\n\nYour target is the main port on the island of Aka, which is 77's primary objective for this landing.  Your strike will be co-ordinated with the TBM's of VT-84.  VBF-83 will be conducting a concurrent strike on the main island of Tokashiki.  Their strike has two objectives:  Firstly; to confuse the enemy of the likely landing point of today's assault.  Secondly; to soften up enemy positions for the further jump to Tokashiki when Aka and its adjacent islands are secured.\n\nI'm glad we all have an understanding.  May God bless you all on this fateful morning.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 0700\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 25 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 0710\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Bright, Hazy\nCloud: 5/10\nWind: Light from SE\nAmbient temp. 62 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 8 x HVAR\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/2 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
