Your route will take you to the east of Okinawa, where you will identify and neutralise any enemy air activity.\n\nOur fleet is vulnerable to air attack from two primary directions:  Firstly from the Japanese mainland to the northeast, and secondly from Formosa, via the Sakashima Gunto in the southwest.  Task Force 57 are covering the latter front, whereas we're covering incoming flights from the Imperial Homeland.\n\nYou are likely to encounter two types of enemy traffic: Either direct attacks on the fleet, or flights on a staging route via Okinawa.  Whatever the apparent enemy intentions, you are fully authorised to engage at your discretion.\n\nAs part of this patrol you will pass over the main port of Naha.  Take a good look while you pass over, and report anything interesting.  Flak is likely to be intense over this area, so flight leaders are instructed to maintain altitude above 15000ft.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nClimbing Drill:\n--------------------\n\nTo maintain contact with your flight during extended climbs, you must prioritize proximity in the horizontal plane over the vertical plane at all times.\n\nThis means that you should not worry if the rest of your flight appear to be climbing at a faster rate than you are.  If you follow a shallower incline during the climb, then you can make up the altitude once your flight has levelled out.  Keep the airplane in front of you directly overhead in the 12 o'clock position.  As long as you keep the horizontal distance between yourself and this airplane minimal, you will have no diffculty keeping contact with your flight.\n\nSupercharger Drill:\n--------------------------\nEngage Stage 2 at 8500ft (2500m)\nEngage Stage 3 at 27000ft (8000m)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1415\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 35 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1425\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Clear\nCloud: 3/10\nWind: Light from SE\nAmbient temp. 71 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: N/A\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 3/4 Main Tank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
