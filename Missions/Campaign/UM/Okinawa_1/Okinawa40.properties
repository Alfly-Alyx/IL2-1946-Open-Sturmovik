We've been giving the Army the benefit of our expertise over the last couple of days, so it's good for us to supply the same service to our fellow Marines.  Arty will mark the target with phospherus, so this mission should be a stroll in the park.\n\nWe've heard news that the first Marine Air Group, MAG 33, including VMF-224, VMF-311 and VMF-441 will be landing at Yontan tomorrow.  Over time they will be taking over CAS and Fleet Defense operations, so our activities here will start to scale down over the next few days.  Tenth Army will then have its own Tactical Air Force to complete the prosecution of ICEBERG.\n\nNevertheless, we'll maintain our standard of operations until this organic force is fully capable.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1645\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 20 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1655\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Cloudy\nCloud: 6/10\nWind: Brisk from NW\nAmbient temp. 67 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 2 x Nap.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/4 Main Tank + 178 gal. droptank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
