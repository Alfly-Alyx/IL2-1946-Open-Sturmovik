This time, you're hitting what remains of the palace itself.  This palace has been the residence of the Okinawan kings for the last 500 years.  It's a reminder that the Okinawans are not the same people as the Japanese.  They've got their own language, their own customs and their own history.\n\nIn many ways the Japs are holding the Okinawans hostage as part  of their own mad scheme.  Maybe we can win them over and make our ultimate job easier.  It's gonna be hard after the inevitable Imperial brainwashing, and after the local's sacred sites have been turned into fortresses we have to destroy.\n\nStill, the hope is there that we can turn at least some of those people round to seeing the Japanese for what they are: deceitful, manipulative aggressors.\n\nNo matter.  The palace is mainly made of wood so we're gonna hit it with napalm.  It's already a mess from our previous strikes and from NGF.  Let's keep up the good work and burn that sucker down.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1715\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 20 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1725\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Dull\nCloud: 5/10\nWind: Light from North\nAmbient temp. 62 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 2 x Nap.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nFuel: 1/4 Main Tank + 178gal. droptank\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n
