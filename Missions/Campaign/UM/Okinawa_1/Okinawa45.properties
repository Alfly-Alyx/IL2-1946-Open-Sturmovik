Your target is the enemy outpost of Fed Hill, which is mounting stiff resistance to 1/184.\n\nYour performance over the last few weeks has been outstanding, but we're now passing over the task to the capable hands of MAG31 and MAG33 at Yontan and Kadena.  This operation has a long way to go and there will be more pain to be endured and more glory to be earned before it's done.\n\nYou can be proud of the part you have played in the prosecution of ICEBERG.  It's men like you who make me certain of the righteousness of our cause, and the inevitability of our final victory.\n\nMay God go with you all, always.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nScheduled Flight Time: 1225\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nEstimated Flight Duration: 20 min.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nTime Over Target: 1230\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nAnticipated weather conditions: Poor\nCloud: 6/10\nWind: Strong from North\nAmbient temp. 77 F\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nExternal Stores: 8 x HVAR + 2 x 500lb.
