Description Sqn: VMF-123 Eight Balls\t\nDate:\t8/18/43\nTime:\t2120\nWind:\tNegligible \nClouds: Clear\nLocn:\tMunda\nTask:\tNight Strike Simbo Anchorage\n\nOrders:\n\nYou did a terrific job against the Japanese convoy from Kolombangara this afternoon. While you were up a pair of USN PBY aircraft spotted Japanese trying to either evacuate or reinforce Simbo Island. A costal battery here could threaten the shipping lanes between Barakoma and Munda. Whatever the Japanese intention ComAirNew Georgia wants us to put a stop to it tonight.\n\nDivision III of VMF-123 will accompany the same pair of PBY aircraft which will take off from the western entrance to the Munda Bar. They are armed with bombs, and flares to light up the anchorage at Simbo Harbor. Your job will be to swoop in and finish the job with 500 lb. bombs.\n\nGet low for accuracy at night, but Be Sure to have your bombs set with a delay!\n\nAlso, if you spot any other Japanese ships on the move this close to Munda be sure to call it in.\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n\n
