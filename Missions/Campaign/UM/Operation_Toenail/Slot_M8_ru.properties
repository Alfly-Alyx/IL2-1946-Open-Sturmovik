Strike composed of Six TBF Avenger torpedo-bombing aircraft, and Eight SBD Dauntless dive-bombing aircraft. All of which are set to launch from Cactus at six hundred hours this morning. Because of stepped up Jap traffic in the Vella Gulf the ComAirSols G-2 believes that the Japanese have a far greater stock pile of supplies at Vanga Vanga, than was previously expected. The purpose of this mission is to totally destroy the Vanga Vanga village, anchorage, and depot. Escorts may strafe Vanga Vanga anchorage, and any small ships they see IF the skies over Kolombangara are clear.\n\nWar Diary:\n\nApril 29, 1943\n\n- 0620 1020 Twelve F4Us escorted eight SBDs and six TBFs on strike against Vanga Vanga on Kolombangara Island, where Jap supply dump was reported.
