Transfer hop composed of sixteen F4U-1A aircraft of VMF-123 divisions one through four. VMF-123 will be accompanying three R4D transport aircraft (S.C.A.T.) carrying pilots and ground crew for the squadron. \n\nSouth of Lion Head Mountain, off Guadalcanal's southern coast, division one will separate along with the S.C.A.T. aircraft and head directly north to Cactus. Divisions two through four will continue to forward airfields on the Russell Islands, code named Knucklehead. We are going to have to scavenge for fuel, ammunition, and help for the first few days, but its the only way. We get as close the front as ComSoPac will let us.\n\nWhile you were away allied tanks led assaults on enemy positions near Lambetti Plantation, two days later a battalion of infantry and Marine tanks were finally able to capture Munda Point!\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n
