Short The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\t\nDate: 7/15/43\nTime:\t1300\nWind:\t5mph NW\nClouds: 1/4 broken @ 4,500 feet\nLocn:\tKnucklehead\nTask:\tDowser - LaVella Patrol\n\nOrders:\n\n15 July, Eight F4U-1s of divisions I and III will conduct a Dowser - LaVella patrol. There are no identified Japanese airbases on Vella LaVella however be sure to cover the Naval areas of the Gizo Strait and Vella Gulf, and the suspected Japanese troop concentrations near Kundurum Bangara Point. The objective of this mission is to test, and gather information on the defenses of Vella LaVella. Take note that two days ago U.S. Army infantry units landed at Laiana Beach, about 2 and a half miles east of Munda airfield. Along with the landing force went a detachment of light tanks belonging to the 9th Defense Battalion under Captain R. W. Blake. Their mission is to spearhead the advance, knocking out enemy log bunkers, pillboxes, and other strong points. This morning the tanks broke through the enemys strong positions after Army infantry had repeatedly been thrown back. Regardless of such the XIV Corps attack on Munda has been stalled by dogged resistance, and rugged terrain. \n\nThe War Diary:\n\nJuly 15, 1943\n\nTwo divisions led by Captain Cupp took off at 1330 to conduct a Dowser - LaVella patrol. They arrived on station at 1430 at 10,000 feet and were immediately informed, By Vega base, of a bogey of bombers and fighters coming in over Kolumbangara at 26,000 feet. Due to the Japs altitude the flight was in no position to intercept and began a climbing circle. The bombers separated after passing over Munda and Rendova. Cupps division saw seven bombers below them after the bombers had broken their formation. Thomas dove on the bomber on the left. He was unable to observe the result of his dive because when he pulled out he got on a Zero, fired, and caused the zero to bust into flames and explode. He saw the same bomber that he had made his original dive on, so he climbed for altitude and made a second run on the bomber, which started smoking from its right engine. It crashed about 20 miles off the northwest coast of Vella LaVella. After this a Zero got on Thomas tail shooting bullets all through his wings and fuselage and chased him homeward. South of Vella LaVella, Thomas flew into a cloud, did a wing over and when he came out of the cloud he was on the tail of the Zero. He fired at the Zero which burst into flames, exploded and what was left of it hit the water between Ganongga and Simbo Islands. On returning to base at 1530 he found his plane to have received 61 hits!\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
