Description ~~~~~~~~~~\nDiary of Charles C. Winnia\n~\nSaturday, 20 February\n\nNo hangover today. This afternoon flew planes to Ford Island. Strafed field by division. Ours was best formation & we were all lower than dogsback roof. Belly tanks restricted maneuvers. The 4th Division, Treffer leading. I fly his wing. Boag leads 2nd element with Johnson on his wing. All landed safely at Ford Island. Didn't even lose a belly tank. Returned in DC3. All were glad to land. None of us felt really safe in the damned thing, especially as passengers. We still love our fighters. God Bless the F4F4. \n\n(Treffer had been a barnstormer in his teens and had joined the Royal Canadian Air Force before the war, He was probably the most experienced pilot in the squadron at the time.)\n~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Chalkboard:\n\nSqn:  VMF-213 Hellhawks\nDate:\t2/20/43\nTime:\t1000\nWind:\tNegligible\nClouds: Clear\nLocn: Ewa Marine Air Field\nTask: Transfer nine F4F4s to CVE-16\n\nOrders:\n\nThis morning Major Britt will be leading a compliment of nine F4F4 aircraft to land on CVE-16, the USS Nassau, a light carrier. Several members of the squadron are already aboard, and the rest of the squadron will be following us aboard the USS President Tyler in the next few days.\n\nWar Diary:\n\nFebuary 20, 1943: Twenty flying officers and two MAPs, under the command of Major Britt, boarded the carrier NASSAU and departed from Pearl Harbor, destination unknown.\n\nFebuary 24, 1943: The remaining complement of the squadron sailed from Pearl Harbor aboard the USS President Tyler.\n\n(HISTORICAL NOTES): A Division is a naval term for a group of four aircraft. An element is two aircraft of a Division. Generally the more experienced or more aggressive pilot was the leader. The Japanese, on the other hand were using a three aircraft division until well into the war. The Japanese pilots were generally "Lone Wolves", and would not fly as leader and wing.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4F-4 Wildcat\nSkin: Slot_F4F4.bmp, Markings on.\n
