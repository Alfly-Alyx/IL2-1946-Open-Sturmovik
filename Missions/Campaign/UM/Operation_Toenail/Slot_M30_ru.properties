Description Sqn: VMF-123 Eight Balls\t\nDate:\t8/18/43\nTime:\t0700\nWind:\tNegligible \nClouds: Clear\nLocn:\tMunda\nTask:\tStrike reinforcement barges\n\nOrders:\n\n18 August, Eight F4U-1As of VMF-123, divisions III, and IV will fly a patrol of the Vella Gulf along with three Army B-25G strafers. We know most of you are still tired from last nights missions, but we have to see this Invasion through. \n\nSince the invasion of Vella Lavella, the heavily defended and by passed Island of Kolombangara has been slowly evacuating soldiers by barge. Most of these barges are trying to sneak across the Vella Gulf to reinforce what little Japanese forces are on Vella LaVella Island. \n\nIn the pre-dawn hours PT patrol boats spotted another convoy of Japanese barges leaving Vanga Vanga on Kolombangara, and heading towards Vella Lavella. US Cruisers off the landings zones have been trying to shell the Japanese Convoy. Your Primary objectives will be the Barges, any other Japanese naval vessels will be secondary.\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n\n
