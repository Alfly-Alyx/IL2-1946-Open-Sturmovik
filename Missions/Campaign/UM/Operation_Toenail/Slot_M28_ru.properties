Description Sqn: VMF-123 Eight Balls\t\nDate:\t8/15/43\nTime:\t0545\nWind:\tNegligible \nClouds: Clear\nLocn:\tMunda\nTask:\tCover Marine landings on Vella LaVella\n\nOrders:\n\n15 August, D-Day (Vella LaVella)Twelve F4U-1As of divisions II, III, and IV will be covering Task Force 31 as their LCIs and LCTs conduct the preliminary invasion of Vella Lavellas southern shores at Barakoma, near the Gizo Strait. Three DDs and one Cruiser will sail parallel to the beaches on Barakoma, while a fourth DD escorting the first wave of troop transports lays a smoke screen. Keep over the Task Force at six to ten thousand feet and maintain patrol until fuel requires your return. After your first circuit around the taskforce LCI and LCT craft will cross the T of their naval support, pushing through the smoke screen and towards the beaches. We expect the Japanese to launch air attacks on the invasion force from the north when they find out about it. \n\nGeneral Mulcahy moved the ComAir New Georgia command Post with us to Munda Point. The mop up operations on Arundel and New Georgia Islands are coming to a close. ComSoPac intelligence has convinced Admiral Halsey that the Japanese have established themselves on Kolombangara Island in considerable strength, and that the airfield on Kolombangara is laden with water and hardly usable. No one wants to see a slow slug match like the fight for Munda. Thankfully, ComSoPac has decided to bypass Kolombangara and isolate the island with air and naval forces.\n\n(Historical Note: Historically only small IJA forces inhabited Vella Lavella. In this mission a somewhat larger force has settled into crude defensive positions on Barakoma.) \n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n
