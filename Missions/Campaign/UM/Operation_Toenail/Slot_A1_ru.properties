Description NOTE: This is the last mission of your first tour with VMF-213.\n\nBelow is an entry from Lt. Winnias diary as he ended his first tour. His diary was used to help form the ORDERS section of your mission briefings. \n\n~~~~~~~~\nSaturday 22 May\n142nd Day, Maritime Day, 223 Days to come \n\nLeft Tontouta 0001. Froze all the way to Sidney. Arrived here 0900. Bucked headwind all the way. Went to Red Cross O.C. #2 Elizabeth Bay Road. By 1100 was in town at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Sent $500 to my account S.D. With Lt. Don Hancy U.S.N. made a date for 1300 went to zoo in afternoon, then to Recreation Park in Ewing. The weather is much like S.F. cold (to us) and wet. The people are very friendly though a little hard to understand. It is sure nice to see tall buildings, pretty girls and eat good steak, not forgetting hot water, a real luxury. Staying at Red Cross O.C. for the duration. The Hotel Australia Lobby is full of the largest number of pretty girls looking for dates with marines. They are out for all they can get, but most of us are also so what the hell? \n~~~~~~~~\n\n____________________\nAcft: C-47 Skytrain (R4D Marine Version).\nSkin: Slot_R4D.bmp\n
