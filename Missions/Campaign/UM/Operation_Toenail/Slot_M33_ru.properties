Description Sqn: VMF-123 Eight Balls\t\nDate:\t9/01/43\nTime:\t1415\nWind:\tNegligible\nClouds: Clear\nLocn:\tMunda\nTask:\tAnti-shipping strike \n\nOrders:\n\nEarly this morning a PBY reconnaissance aircraft located a convoy of Japanese ships we had lost track of over the last few days. The enemy taskforce was found south by southwest of the Treasury Islands and is larger than we expected. ComSoPac figures the taskforce is heading to either Vella Lavella or Kolombangara. Due to the amount of barges present they figure they have the objective of rescuing or reinforcing Japanese forces trapped on one of these islands. ComAirSols is assembling a massive force to sink every last ship in this convoy, but ComAirNew Georgia will get the first crack! \n\nTwelve SBDs and twelve TBFs took off from Ondonga fifteen minutes ago. We have been delayed here at Munda because one of our Corsairs blew a tire and flipped over in the middle of the runway. Every available aircraft from VMF-123s forward elements will take off immediately. Your orders are to fly around the Wana Wana Lagoon while climbing to an altitude of fifteen thousand feet, and then make your way to the rendezvous over Pature Point. \n\nOur PBY found among the Japanese ships a Yamato class battle ship! ComSoPac thinks this displays how desperate the Japanese are to save their forces in the central Solomon Islands. Sinking such a ship would deal a great blow to Japanese Naval potential and potency in the south pacific. Therefore, this ship has been marked as the primary target for our main strike force. \n\nVMF-123 was ordered to fly ahead of the main strike force to check for fighters and sweep smaller AAA destroyer escorts, so try your best to catch up with everyone. You will arrive over target around fifteen thousand feet. If the skies are clear VMF-123 will use the new dive bomb brakes on the F4U-1A to attack the destroyers. If you show up late and the battleships is still in action then go ahead and attack it. Each Corsair is being fitted with two one thousand pound bombs, so be careful in how you deliver your munitions, dive bombing should be the safest.   \n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n
