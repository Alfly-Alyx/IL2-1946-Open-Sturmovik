Description Sqn: VMF-123 Eight Balls\t\nDate:\t8/14/43\nTime:\t0800\nWind:\tNegligible \nClouds: Clear\nLocn:\tKnucklehead\nTask:\tTransfer with R4D to Munda\n\nOrders:\n\n14 August, Twelve F4U-1As of division II, III, and IV are to transfer to the captured and renovated airbase at Munda along with a pair of R4D aircraft carrying everything else the three Flights will need to operate from this forward base. Note we have been given the honor to be the first squadron based at the new Munda airfield. A lot has happened while VMF-123 has been training in the new F4U-1As. On August 1 Jap air raids hit the torpedo boat mooring basin at Rendova. On August 5 Munda airfield was captured and occupied by XIV Corps Army troops. That night Jap DDs and barges heading to retake Munda were turned back in the Vella Gulf. On August 6 the Zanana Beach, and Laiana Beach detachments moved to participate in the Munda defenses. A day later, the 9th Defense Battalion began moving to the Munda area. The Moves were so organized that there was no more than a quarter of the battalions weapons out of action at any one time. August 8 the Long Tom 155mm guns on Rendova began to move to Kindu Point on New Georgia where they could guard the western approaches to Blanche Channel.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n
