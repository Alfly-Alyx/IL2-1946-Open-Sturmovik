Description Sqn: VMF-123 Eight Balls\t\nDate:\t8/17/43\nTime:\t1930\nWind:\t13mph W, Gusty\nClouds: 1/2 covered @ 3,000 feet\nLocn:\tMunda\nTask:\tNight Strike Boro Village Landing\n\nOrders:\n\nNaval PT Boats have spotted camouflaged barges being escorted by a Japanese Destroyer off the northern coast of Vella Lavella Island. These ships were spotted making way for Boro Village, where It is speculated that they are attempting to land Japanese Troops on Vella Lavella.\n\nDivision III of VMF-123 is being sent up to help PBY aircraft conduct a nocturnal strike on the Japanese while they are at anchorage. The PBYs will be carrying ground flares to mark your targets along with depth charges and torpedoes for the Japanese Navy. They will mark the target first to increase the accuracy of Divisions IIIs bombs. The main objectives for this mission are any troop barges, followed by any other ground forces already established in Boro Village. The PBYs are sure to take care of the Destroyer.\n\nAlso, in order to increase accuracy and safety its suggested that you order your Ordinance Officers to set a delay on your bombs.\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n
