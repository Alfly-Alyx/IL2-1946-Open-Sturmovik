Description The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\t\nDate: 5/04/43\nTime: 1530\nWind: 9mph gusty, NW\nClouds: 3/4 broken @ 4,000 feet\nLocn:\tCactus\nTask:\tFinal strike on Vanga Vanga\n\nOrders:\n\n4 May, Eight F4U-1s of divisions I and III have been chosen to operate from the auxiliary airstrip, Fighter One to help with congestion. All throughout the day elements of VMF-213 have been attacking the enemy concentrations and anchorage at Vanga Vanga on the northwestern coast of Kolombangara. All of the large structures on Vanga Vanga have been destroyed along with most of the supplies there, now the Japanese seem to be trying to either on or off load troops onto Kolombangara via Vanga Vanga. This afternoon divisions, I and III will conduct a final strike on any troop concentrations in and around the village, along with any barges or landing craft operating in the area, and any operational AA. On return from Vanga Vanga VMF-213, divisions I and III will land at Fighter One. Be mindful of high traffic on return to Fighter One, VMF-123s Wildcats keep the strip rather busy flying CAP for Cactus.\n \nWar Diary:\n\nMay 4, 1943\n\n- 0530 Alert 8 F4U.\n- 0805 1200 Strafing Vanga Vanga 8 F4U.\nMajor Weissenberger, Lts.
