Description Sqn:  S.C.A.T.\nDate:\t9/08/43\nTime:\t0700\nWind:\tNegligible\nClouds: Clear\nLocn:\tRendova Hbr.\nTask: Sit Co-Pilot on a PBY Transfer\n\nAn officer from ComAirNew Georgia's signal corps delivers orders to you. These orders state that VMF-123 will be coming off the line soon and sent to Australia for a time before being sent home. Whereas, VMF-213 was ending their third tour on Guadalcanal and will be heading to Hawaii soon. In light of the fact that you were forcibly transferred from VMF-213, the command of VMF-123, has decided to transfer you back into your home squadron so you can make it home sooner to see your family.\n\nLater, after you have been given your travel orders and transfer papers, you hear that a left seat was open on a PBY (S.C.A.T.) transport to anyone with permission and twin engine experience. You jump on the opportunity and find your transportation back to Cactus. Within an hour you are packed and on a Torpedo Boat heading across the Western Entrance to the Sea Plane Base at Rendova Harbor.\n\nOrders:\n\nS.C.A.T. PBY-A5 "Frank" is in need of a Co-Pilot, as one of its crew has become too sick with fever to fly. Your orders are to take off and climb to an altitude of nine thousand feet over Munda. You will then travel to Kuucklehead where you will be dropping off, and picking up personnel. Land off the eastern coast of Banika Island just north of Loun Island.  Then shut down your engines and wait near the mouth of the inlet between Sunlight and Renard airfields. A boat will come to you. \n\nAfter you have waited for five minutes or so take off again and climb to an altitude of six thousand feet. Your final destination is the Sea Plane Base on the northern coast of Tulagi Island. From here a Torpedo Boat will carry you across the Iron Bottom Sound to Guadalcanal.\n\nNote, if you come into contact with a major Japanese Naval Element you are to simply report such, if it is alone small ship such as a Torpedo Boat, Barge, or Submarine you are given permission to attack such with whatever munitions the pilot has loaded.\n\n(You can treat the Auto Pilot as the PBY Pilot in control if you want. Also, the Computer will NOT land at Knucklehead, you have to do that to get the points.)\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: PBY-A5\nSkin: Default, Markings ON.\n
