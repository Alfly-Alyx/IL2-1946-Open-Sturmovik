All pilots from VMF-213 are going to be getting several months of leave, but you nine have been given the honor to get off this tug a day early.\n\nAfter you deliver these Wildcats you will be free to begin your leave. The Skipper sent word ahead of your early arrival and the Corps has alerted whatever friends and family you have listed on Oahu. Save some of Honolulu for us you lucky bastards!\n\nSemper Fi! \nGentlemen, It's been an Honor. \n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4F-4 Wildcat\nSkin: Slot_F4F4.bmp, Markings On\n
