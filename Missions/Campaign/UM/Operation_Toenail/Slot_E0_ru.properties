Two pilots from Cactus temporarily attached to help with F4U. Pilot conference tonight on F4U. First flight tomorrow. Celebration tonight in honor of Capt. Humberd's 26th birthday. Some dive bombers dropped flares tonight. Made a very brilliant light. Another night of drinking and singing in honor of Lt. Humberd. \n\nFriday 12 March \n\nFlew the F4U today. Really a wonderful airplane. Goes like hell and handles like a dream. We should really be able to work over the Zeros.\n~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\nDate:\t3/13/43\nTime:\t1200\nWind:\tNegligible\nClouds: Clear\nLocn:\tEspiritu Santo Island (Buttons)\nTask:\tPractice ground strike and familiarization.\n\nOrders:\n\nDivision Three of VMF-213 is order to conduct a practice attack on a small range island in the middle of the channel. Remember your lectures from the VMF-124 pilots on the F4U, and what you learned yesterday.\n \nWar Diary\n\nMarch 3, 1943: The squadron catapulted all the planes, F4Fs, from the carrier and flew them to Espiritu Santo, One plane was lost when being catapulted, the pilot, Stf.Sgt. Hodde, was uninjured. \n\nMarch 11, 1943: The squadron received 11 F4U's.\n\nMarch 12, 1943: First day of F4U familiarization flying - gunnery and other operational flying conducted. G.J. WEISSENBERGER Major, USMC, named Commander VMF-213.\n\n(HISTORICAL NOTES): The two pilots from Cactus were Lts. Hartsock and Kuhn of VMF-124. The Lts. told the VMF-213 pilots that the Japanese Zero was more maneuverable at slow speeds at low altitudes, so dog-fighting was not the way to beat them. At high speed, however, the Zero's big ailerons became so heavy that the plane couldn't be controlled, therefore the trick to beating them was to hit them quickly and at high speed, and if you get into trouble with one dive for the deck at high speed and then use the 2000 H.P. to get back above them and dive into them again. \n\n( 22.bmp will be your corsair, feel free to edit the skin and add your name, kills, nose art or whatever else would further your enjoyment of this campaign. )\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
