Description The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\t\nDate:\t4/22/43\nTime:\t1545\nWind:\t17mph west, gusty\nClouds: Covered @ 3,500 feet\nLocn:\tCactus\nTask:\tStrafe Vila and Munda\n\nOrders:\n\n22 April, Four F4U-1s of division I, led by Major Weissenberger and Lieutenants Defabio, will conduct a sweep and strafe mission on identified Japanese airfields Munda and Vila, in the New Georgia and Kolombangara Island areas. Weather is poor, recommended low altitude approach for visibility. Note the 'Eightballs', VMF-123 will be operating patrols in the area from Fighter One.\n\nWar Diary:\n\nApril 22, 1943\n\n- 0730 0905 Eight F4Us escorted PB4Y, Captain Humberds flight on photo mission over Rekata.\n- 0530 Alert 8 F4U.\n- 1120 1155 Lt. Garison Test Hop 1 F4U.\n- 1545 1915 Strafing mission on Munda 4 F4U.\n\nFour F4Us flown by Major Weissenberger, Lieutenants DeFabio and Thomas and Captain Cloake. Flight braved bad weather and flew at tree tops, through heavy clouds over New Georgia Island to Vila. They took the airfield at Vila completely by surprise and made a strafing run on it, after which they circled back, south of the Munda Airfield and made a very low and daring run on it. A large tractor or roller was set afire at Vila and a truck, two airplanes and a fuel dump were fired at Munda.\n\nThey received heavy anti-aircraft fire at Munda. DeFabios plane received a hit from the AA that tore away 46 inches from the end of his right wing. He had made about one third of his run when his plane was hit, but was able to gain enough altitude to clear the trees at the end of the runway. When over the water North of Rendova Island he thought he was going to have to make a water landing as his plane was clumsy and unmaneuverable and he did not think he could make the trip home. Due to the encouragement of the other members of the flight, he decided to try to and fly home and succeeded in gradually climbing to 4,000 feet, at which altitude he flew home. On landing he was able to get the plane on the runway in proper order, but due to loss of flying speed, the crippled wing gave a dip, the right tire blew out and the plane tipped up on its nose, sliding thereon for 200 feet.\n\nDeFabio was uninjured and the plane was not seriously damaged, he did an excellent bit of piloting in order to get home. \n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
