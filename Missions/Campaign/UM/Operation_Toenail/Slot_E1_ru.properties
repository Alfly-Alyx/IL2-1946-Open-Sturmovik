You signed up after the attacks on Pearl Harbor and spent two combat tours in the Solomon Islands with VMF-213, a F4U-1 Corsair squadron nicknamed the Hellhawks. When VMF-213 was sent to Sidney for evaluation and relaxation you volunteer to transfer to VMF-123, at Espiritu Santo, and help their pilots make the transfer from Wildcats to Corsairs. \n\nSquadron Orders:\n\nDivison three of VMF-123 will conduct a practice close air support on Crescent Island in the middle of Espiritu Santo Channel. Division three will rendezvous with support vessels at the northwest entrance of the channel, turn to make their strike, and turn for home when they rendezvous with a naval convoy at the southeast entrance of the channel.\n\nPrimary targets are Coastal Guns mounted on the concrete platforms. Secondary targets will be all fuel and water storage, along with any of the anti-aircraft positions.\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n
