In the early hours of 5 July Northern Group landed with out opposition at Rice Anchorage. Threw yesterdays driving rain the only serious interference came from enemy destroyers when a long-range torpedo sunk the USS Strong,DD467. Nevertheless, the troops and most of their equipment and supplies made it ashore, and the amphibious group was able to withdraw before daylight left them vulnerable to further enemy counter action. During the night a vicious naval battle took place in the Kula Gulf. Though our task force was smaller they succeeded in destroying all the enemies ships. Now the amphibious group, and the naval task force are both returning and the USS Nicholas,DD449, is trailing oil and falling behind. Division I will be armed with bombs in case enemy ships are detected. Division II will take a higher pattern incase enemy aircraft are detected. Once the USS Nicholas, DD449 has crossed the safety lines marked on your map both divisions are to RTB.\n\n\nWar Diary:\n\nJuly 6, 1943\n\n0700 1135 Capt. Cupp, Lts. Brown, Votaw, and Winnia, along with Lts. Hall, Shaw, Morgan, and Gunner Hodde Took off to furnish cover over the shipping that was returning from Kula Gulf. They traveled up the northern coast of New Georgia at 9,000 feet. On the way up, Lt. Votaw and others of Capt. Cupps flight observed two cruisers escorted by two DDs just north of Vangunu Island and leading toward the Russells and 20 miles behind those two cruisers was a lone DD traveling in the same direction. This DD trailed an oil slick that extended all the way to Kula Gulf. Master Gunner Hodde returned to base at 0840 due to engine trouble. During the early hours of the morning, at about 0215, a terrific sea battle took place in Kula Gulf. There were 11 enemy war ships, three of which were cruisers, in the Gulf apparently landing troops on Kolambangara. Our task force, consisting of the Helena, St. Louis, and Honolulu, all CLs and four DDs, closed in on the enemy pocketing them in the Gulf. At 0410 our task force has sunk or crippled all eleven enemy ships to such an extent that those not sunk were beached. We lost the Helena but seven eighths of her crew were rescued.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
