The second Naval raid will take place at the same time against Japanese Coastal Batteries on Choiseul Island.\n\nThe forward element of VMF-123, Divisions I, II, III, and IV will support the Naval attack on Choiseul Island along with nine Marine TBF aircraft from VMTB-143. Rendezvous with TBFs over Tirakeamea Hill, New Georgia, close to ten thousand feet.\n\nThere are two Large Fortified Costal Batteries on Choiseul.
