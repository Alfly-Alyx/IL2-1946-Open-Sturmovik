Description Sqn: VMF-123 Eight Balls\t\nDate: 7/30/43\nTime: 0945\nWind: 10mph NW\nClouds: 1/4 broken @ 2,500 feet\nLocn:\tEspiritu Santos Buttons\nTask:\tScramble\n\nDuring the last week of July the pilots of VMF-123 engaged in heated familiarization and close air support training flights in the newest version of the Corsair, the F4U-1A. You have been assigned to help train the third division of the squadron. As August approached the Skipper personally requested you choose to stay with the squadron. He informed you that VMF-123 is to be assigned to the new tactical group ComAir New Georgia. That means the unit is going to be pushed to the most forward allied airbase, the newly captured Munda!\n\nSquadron Orders:\n\nThird division of VMF-123 has been ordered to cancel its training flight today. Element two of third division has instead been ordered to provide an armed escort for a Naval PBY.\n\nAn Allied convoy approaching the Espiritu Santo Strait from the southeast has stumbled into a group of Japanese Submarines. The Naval PBY is carrying Depth Charges and Ink Markers to attack and help mark the Submarines for the convoy's Naval Escorts.\n\nIf you see a submerged submarine you are to attack it with your 500 lbs bombs. Have the ground crew set a one or two second delay on your bombs!\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n
