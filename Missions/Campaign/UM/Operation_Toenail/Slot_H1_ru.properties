Description ~~~~~~~~~~\nDiary of Charles C. Winnia\n~\nFriday, 19 February\n\nWord passed today that we leave soon. Most went to pack. Treffer, Votaw & I went down the beach to Barber's Pt. hunting crabs & swimming. Water too sandy. Long walk home. Barely made chow. Packed tonight. Some gear leaves tomorrow A.M. 0700. Votaw, Treffer & I mixed 2 coconuts, 1 qt. Bacardi Rum & a can of pineapple juice. All felt extremely happy. Raised quite a bit of hell but didn't get sloppy.\n~~~~~~~~~~\nThe Chalkboard:\n\nSqn:  VMF-213 Hellhawks\nDate:\t2/19/43\nTime:\t2120\nWind:\tNegligible\nClouds: 1/4 broken at 3,000 feet\nLocn: Ewa Marine Air Field\nTask: Night Navigation\n\nOrders:\n\nVMF-213, Division Three, Element Two is scheduled to fly a night training flight.
