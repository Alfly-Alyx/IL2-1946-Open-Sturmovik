Description The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn:\tS.C.A.T.\t\nDate:\t3/21/43\nTime:\t0630\nWind:\tNegligible\nClouds: 1/4 broken at 3,000 feet\nLocn: Tulagi SPB\nTask: Transport marine scouts to Segi, New Georgia\n\nOrders:\n\n21 March, a group of Marine scouts drawn from the raider battalions and graduates of the combat reconnaissance school are to be landed by PBY Catalina flying boat nicknamed Dumbo at Segi Plantation on the extreme southeastern tip of New Georgia. Also among the crew are two Marine pilots from Marine Fighting 213, their objective is to become familiar with the area. Once at Segi the Marine Raiders will rendezvous with Coastwatcher Donald G. Kennedy and will use natives as guides as they split into patrols and set out to scout possible landing beaches, landmarks, and motor torpedo boat anchorages. These patrols will be checking travel time from point to point, taking bearings on channels, scouting enemy dispositions and installations, and sketching crude maps to help fill in the scanty information already available. Most of the island is reef-lined, with Marova and Grassi Lagoons bordering the coast so be very careful when landing, and taxing to the beach. Also, remember your landing in enemy territory, the potential for danger is quite high!\n\n\n__________________\nAcft: PBY Catalina.\nSkin: BismarkSeaBlackCat.bmp, No Markings.\n
