Description The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\t\nDate: 4/07/43\nTime: 1450\nWind: 5mph, variable\nClouds: 1/3 broken at 3,500 feet\nLocn: Cactus\nTask:\tPatrol Russell Islands Knucklehead\n\nOrders:\n\n7 April, Four F4U-1s of division I (In VMF-213 a Division is a flight of four aircraft) set for afternoon patrol of the Russell Islands code named Knucklehead.

Due to the fact that the squadron only arrived four days ago and had not become completely adjusted to the new surroundings, plus the fact that six of the planes used arrived only a short time before word was passed to scramble, the squadron was a bit handicapped. But all planes were used, that were flyable, and those making contact with the enemy gave a good account for themselves. \n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
