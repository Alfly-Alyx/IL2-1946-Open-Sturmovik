Boag to lead a flight to cover a supply force sent to the Russell Islands, however thirty minutes into the sortie division I encountered a strong squall line of storms, lost visual on one another, and has just been recalled back to Fighter One which is being lit up with vehicle headlights for your approach. Good Luck getting back on the deck!\n\nWar Diary:\n\nMay 5, 1943\n\n- 0530 Alert 8 F4Us.\n- 0845 1210 Knucklehead Patrol  Lt. Boags 4 F4Us.\n- 1630 1800 Knucklehead Patrol 4 F4Us.\nMajor Leary, Lt.
