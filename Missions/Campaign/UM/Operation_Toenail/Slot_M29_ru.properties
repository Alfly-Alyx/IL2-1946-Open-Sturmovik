Description Sqn: VMF-123 Eight Balls\t\nDate:\t8/16/43\nTime:\t1430\nWind:\t13mph W, Gusty\nClouds: 1/2 covered @ 3,000 feet\nLocn:\tMunda\nTask:\tClose Air Support and Recon\n\nOrders:\n\n16 August, Four F4U-1As of divisions III will fly close air support for Marines on Vella Lavella. Marine commanders on Vella Lavella report harassing mortar and Artillery fire from two heights on Vella Lavella. The 4th Defensive Battalions artillery had tried to remove this annoyance for those active on the beach without any luck. The 4th Defensive Battalion reports that they will mark these areas with white smoke and would like for VMF-123 to deal with it.\n\nMeanwhile, Halsey is sending two small naval surface taskforces north to complete the isolation of Kolombongara. The southern taskforce will head up the Wilson Strait to cover the Marines advance on Vella Lavella, and to sweep Ganongga Island of any costal artillery. The northern taskforce will sail up the slot to seal off Kolombongara and the Vella Gulf.\n\nYour Division will fly recon over Gizo during your approach to Vella Lavella and your return to Munda. A Naval CA and DD are attempting to neutralize the Japanese Sea Plane Base there.  \n\nNote, PBY aircraft will be in the area as you take off. They are making recon sweeps of the various Islands around Vella Lavella looking for Japanese presence.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n
