Kahili has been the main forward bomber airbase for the Japanese. Keep attentive for enemy aircraft, we had not expected as many fighters in this area as we had yesterday, and as always, watch your fuel. Take note that last night at Zanana Beach, 9th Defense Battalion Marines were involved in some memorable fighting. Thanks to the heroics of two men, Private John Wantuck, and Corporal Maier J. Rothchild the battle was won. Private Wantuck unfortunately did not survive the encounter, both are suspect for either The Medal, or the Navy Cross. \n\nWar Diary:\n\nJuly 18, 1943 \n\nAnother strike against the Kahili area as a follow through of our success of yesterday. Todays target being the Kahili air field rather than the shipping. Three divisions of 213 furnished cover for B-24s. Divisions took off at 0740, and rendezvous with the bombers over Segi. They approached the target at 23,000 feet from the northeast, having circled around behind Kahili. The bombers dropped their bombs and retired down the Slot. Contact was made with Zeros as they bombers when into their run. They did not make any aggressive attack on the bombers, but attempted to lure the fighters off of the cover. Capt. Cloakes division attacked about twenty Zeros that were below and ahead of them. A Zero got on Capt. Cloakes tail, but McCleary chased it off, then two Zeros attacked McCleary, but the other members of the division chased them off. These attacking Zeros came from above. McCleary got on the tail of a Zero below him, fired at it, and it burst into flames and went down. Lt. Winnia was not seen after initial contact was made and is missing in action. Four Zeros attacked Hall and Shaw from above, one of which got a successful shot into Halls plane, starting it smoking. Hall went into a glide in the direction of Choiseul and was last seen to land in the water about five miles off the eastern tip of Mali Island. Lt. Browns plane received many hits, but he was uninjured. The three divisions, less Hall and Winnia, left the bombers at Segi and returned to base. \n\nAll Pilots of VMF-213 Grounded After Completion Of Mission, Rated Combat Fatigue.

Description The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\t\nDate:\t7/18/43\nTime:\t0740\nWind:\t7mph W\nClouds: 1/4 broken @ 3,500 feet\nLocn:\tKnucklehead\nTask:\tEscort B-24s to Kahili\n\nOrders:\n\n18 July, Twelve F4U-1s of divisions I, II, and III are to rendezvous with Twenty B-24 Liberator bombers over Segi and provide escort to Kahili and back to Cactus. Following this mission all divisions of VMF-213 will converge at Fighter One. Kahili has been the main forward bomber airbase for the Japanese. Keep attentive for enemy aircraft, we had not expected as many fighters in this area as we have seen, your likely to stir up a hornets nest today. As always, watch your fuel. Take note that the G-2 has marked a Coastwatcher area on Choiseul incase anyone is forced down. Segi is still the nearest Marine airbase though Munda should fall any day. Last night at Zanana Beach, 9th Defense Battalion Marines were involved in some memorable fighting. Thanks to the heroics of two men, Private John Wantuck, and Corporal Maier J. Rothchild the battle was won. Private Wantuck unfortunately did not survive the encounter, both are suspect for either The Medal, or the Navy Cross. \n\nWar Diary:\n\nJuly 18, 1943 \n\nAnother strike against the Kahili area as a follow through of our success of yesterday.
