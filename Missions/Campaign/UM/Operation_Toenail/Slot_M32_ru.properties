Description Sqn: VMF-123 Eight Balls\t\nDate:\t8/30/43\nTime:\t1625\nWind:\t7mph N\nClouds: 1/4 broken @ 5,500 feet\nLocn:\tMunda\nTask:\tEscort B-24s to Kahili\n\nOrders:\n\n30 August, All forward elements of VMF-123s  divisions II, III, and IV will take off and circle Munda three times, gaining altitude. Following such the F4Us are to rendezvous with thirty-two  B-24 Liberator aircraft from the Fifth Bomb Group, Twenty-Third Bomb Squadron over the emergency landing strip at Segi Point. Rendezvous will be at twenty-five thousand feet and from there you will escort the bombers to southern Bougainville. This bombing raid is one of the heaviest we have been able to levee against Kahili. It should severely wound future Japanese efforts to conduct offensive aerial raids in the southern and central Solomons. The bomb run will be conducted near dusk with just enough light for our Norden Bombsites to be accurate. The hope is that the timing of this raid will help the group encounter less resistance.\n\nAll forward elements of VMF-123 will follow the bombers through their bombing run, and rendezvous over Kondakaninboka Plantation on Choiseul Bay. While you are over the bay keep a watch out for enemy ships, a Japanese Naval Taskforce steamed out of the Bougainville Straits last night and we can't seem to find them!\n\nFrom the plantation escort the Liberator aircraft all the way back to Cactus. It will be a long mission today so be sure to take external fuel tanks. All forward divisions have been charged to land their aircraft at Fighter One this afternoon. During the evening hours ground elements of ComAirSols will be looking over your Corsair aircraft and conducting various maintenance tasks.\n\nFirst thing tomorrow morning Division III will return to Munda by request of General Mulcahy for T.A.D. It is expected that VMF-123 will be coming off the line soon. When that happens our F4U-1A aircraft will more than likely go to another squadron.\n\nI dont have to remind you that Kahili, Bougainville is probably the most dangerous area for allied pilots to be conducting sorties, when you pass the shortland Islands you will be flying into the mouth of hell. Reports of anti-aircraft emplacements come close to rivaling that of Rabaul, and southern Bougainville is home to some of the most elite fighter squadrons in the south pacific. By engaging the Japanese fighters it is our hopes that you will draw them away from our bombers. However, if you find yourself alone and among enemy aircraft make for the deck as fast as you can and get out of there. \n\nRemember, Barakoma Airstrip at the Vella Lavella invasion beach is ready to accept aircraft. If you find your F4U has become hit make your way for this emergency landing strip as fast as possible!\n\n(TAD: Temporary Assigned Duty)\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1A Corsair.\nSkin: VMF-123_F4U.bmp, Markings ON.\n
