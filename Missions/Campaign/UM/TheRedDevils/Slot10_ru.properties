Description MAG 14/VMTB-232\n===============\nDecember 11 1943\n===============\nTime: 12:35\n===============\nWeather: Hazy\n===============\nOrd.: N/A\n===============\n\nNaval Construction Battalions have completed laying operating strips on Bougainville, so we shall transfer to the new fields today.  We understand that General Turnage is seeking to expand his perimeter to encompass defensible positions around Hill 1000 and Hill 600A.  We shall assist him in this endeavor.  We believe that there are considerable Japanese infantry concentrations that are amassing to the east of our current perimeter and just out of artillery range.  It is imperative that a secure perimeter is established to meet any anticipated counter-attacks.\n\nIt's a good day to go north gentlemen.  May God go with you on your journey.\n
