Description MAG 14/VMTB-232\n===============\nSeptember 14 1943\n===============\nTime: 14:05\n===============\nWeather: Cloudy\n===============\nOrd.: 8 x HVAR + 4 x 500lbs. HE\n===============\n\nComAirSols has instructed ComAir New Georgia to concentrate strikes on enemy airfields, as part of a drive to reduce enemy fighter sweeps and nuisance raids in the New Georgia/Vella Lavella area of operations, and also as part of the general attrition of enemy materiel.\n\nStrike this afternoon is the new enemy field on Ballale Island.  Jesus, they made a poor attempt at disguising this one.  Priority targets are aircraft and ancilliary facilities.  VMF-214 will be on escort.  Don't keep yabbering at them for help as they'll likely have their hands full.  You might have to pull yourselves out of any mess you find yourselves in.\n
