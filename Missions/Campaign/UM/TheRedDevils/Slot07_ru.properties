Description MAG 14/VMTB-232\n===============\nOctober 15 1943\n===============\nTime: 15:35\n===============\nWeather: Hazy\n===============\nOrd.: 2 x 1000lbs. HE\n===============\n\nStrike this afternoon is on the enemy naval base at Shortland.  We're going to try to surprise them with a low-level strike in co-ordination with the Army's 390th Bomb Squadron.  Priority targets are ships and seaplanes.  Expect the AAA to be thick and accurate - we've given them enough practice by now.  The Army will be taking up escort duties.  I know you'd rather be covered by our own boys, but sometimes we need to share things around over here.\n
