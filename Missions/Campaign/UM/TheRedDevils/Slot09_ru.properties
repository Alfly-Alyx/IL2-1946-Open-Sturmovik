Description MAG 14/VMTB-232\n===============\nNovember 1 1943\n===============\nTime: 06:20\n===============\nWeather: Misty\n===============\nOrd.: 8 x HVAR + 4 x 100lbs. HE\n===============\n\nToday is the most important day in this campaign so far.  We are landing on Bougainville, at Cape Torokina in Empress Augusta Bay.  You will be hitting identified Japanese positions on the Cape itself, defending "Blue 1" beach that is the objective of 3/1 Marines.  NGF will be suspended during the duration of your strike, so don't hang around as they'll be anxious to resume.\n\nThe order to land the landing force will be given prior to your strike, so look out for the boats west of Puruata Island.  If you see any enemy positions firing at them, then destroy them as a priority.  Go to it men, and ensure that today is a grand day for the United States Marine Corps.\n
