Description MAG 14/VMTB-232\n===============\nSeptember 25 1943\n===============\nTime: 11:30\n===============\nWeather: Overcast\n===============\nOrd.: 8 x HVAR\n===============\n\nRecon has spotted disguised enemy boats on the northwest shore of Kolombangara, in the vicinity of Sandfly Harbor.  Looks like the Japs are getting ready to cut and run.  We're gonna spoil their party by busting up those boats before they get a chance to use them. The longer we can keep them holed up on that island, tired and hungry, the less problems they can present to the further prosecution of CARTWHEEL.\n
