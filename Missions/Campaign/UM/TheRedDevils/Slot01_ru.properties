Description MAG 14/VMTB-232\n===============\nAugust 29 1943\n===============\nTime: 10:05\n===============\nWeather: Cloudy\n===============\nOrd.: 4 x 250lbs. HE\n===============\n\nFirst of all I'd like to say Howdy to all you new men, and welcome to the war.  We're gonna start you off with a routine strike.  As you'll know from the occasional arty shells we get coming over, there are still a few piss-stinkin' Japs left on these islands.  172nd Infantry have chased the little critters from Baanga, and now they've moved over to Arundel.\n\nIt's tough fighting over there, and the grunts need our help.  They'll use phospherus smoke to mark the enemy positions.  Try to hit them as accurately as possible and give our boys a break.  Take care on landing, as we've still got some pits on the runway track.  We're putting the Seabees on it while you're up in the air, so try to avoid hitting them on landing also.  Good luck and go to it.\n
