Description MAG 14/VMTB-232\n===============\nDecember 18 1943\n===============\nTime: 09:30\n===============\nWeather: Cloudy\n===============\nOrd.: 2 x 500lbs. HE\n===============\n\n21st Marines are continuing their offensive on Hill 1000, and are currently being held up on "Hellzapoppin' Ridge".  Captured Japanese situation maps indicate that this ridge is a natural fortress that has been densely plotted with enemy defensive positions.  So far it has resisted all our attempts at investment.  You will hit it with HE as part of a series of softening strikes prior to the 21st's main assault later today.  Try to cause as much damage as possible, and give the boys on the ground some heart.\n
