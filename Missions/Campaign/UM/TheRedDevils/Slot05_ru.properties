That said, recon counts of airfield population are showing a decline in numbers, so we can be sure the policy is having some effect.  Once we degrade the enemy's air assets, we degrade his ability to maintain garrisons on these islands.\n\nKeep up the good work men - every bomb we drop on target shortens the time the Japs have left in the South Pacific.\n
