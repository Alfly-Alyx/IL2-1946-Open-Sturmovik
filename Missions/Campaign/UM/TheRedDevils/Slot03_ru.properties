Description MAG 14/VMTB-232\n===============\nSeptember 11 1943\n===============\nTime: 16:30\n===============\nWeather: Cloudy\n===============\nOrd.: 1 x Torpedo\n===============\n\nOK we got word of a Rabaul Express heading towards the Western Entrance.  Our esteemed fellows in the United States Navy have spent a lot of time and love trying to get the Mark 13's to work properly, and you lucky men are getting the opportunity to test them out.\n\nYou'll be in the Japs' back yard for the duration of the strike, so VF-33 will be along on escort.  Do not hesitate to call them in if bogeys show up.  Once you've dropped your fish, don't hang around - enemy real estate doesn't welcome loitering salesmen.\n
