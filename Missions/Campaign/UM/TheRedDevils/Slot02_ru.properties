That's why he's decided to leapfrog it and land on Vella Lavella.\n\nThat island has two advantages - the enemy has already built a better airfield there, and it's closer to Bougainville.  The 35th RCT is making steady progress on the island, but they need good support.\n\nOnce again you're hitting a marked target.  The 35th are due to hand over to the New Zealanders later this month, and want to give them as clear a run as possible.  Let's assist them in this noble endeavor.\n
