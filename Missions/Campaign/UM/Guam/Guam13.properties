Peter F. Schrider\n-----------------------------------\n***\nWe've just heard that an Army convoy has been ambushed around the village of Finegayan.  There has been extensive enemy activity in this vicinty all day, suggesting that the area has been chosen by the enemy for concentrated delaying actions.\n***\nYou will strike the village itself, which has been partially destroyed by the Japanese and barricaded for emplaced mortars, HMG's and even heavy caliber weapons, we suspect up to 75mm.\n***\nArmy P-47's from Saipan are due in for a strike to the North of your target.  We need to co-ordinate your action with their scheduled arrival, so you will circulate around the South of the island until your strike is called in.\n***\n***\n(Additional Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: 1/3 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs HE\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
