Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nSince we cleared Orote we've barely seen hide nor hair of the enemy.  Nevertheless General Geiger believes that half of his forces on the island remain uncounted for.\n***\nThe big question on everybody's lips is: Which direction did he go?  Reports from 77th Division patrols indicate that it isn't South, so the guess is they're going to make a stand at one of their Northern strongpoints.\n***\nPhase 2 of the assault jumps off tomorrow morning, with 77th taking the right flank and 3rd Division on the left.  The General wants to maintain a high tempo of operations to keep the enemy unbalanced and disrupt his defensive preparations.\n***\nTo support this strategy, we're on a low-level recon this evening.  Take a look around the North side of the island, in the proximity of Tiyan airfield.  If you see any enemy forces in retreat then harrass them with strafing.  Don't forget to note their direction of movement.  We need all the information we can get of enemy intentions if we're to finalise this campaign as quickly and effectively as possible.\n***\nYou will land on Orote airfield, where over the next few days you will form up with the other attack elements of Marine Air Group 21 - VMF-216, VMF-217, and VMF(N)-534.  A TBF from VT-35 was the first plane to touch down there this morning, and from what we hear it took some small arms fire from the remaining Japs hidden on the peninsula.  So take good care on your approach, and keep walking fast when your feet hit the ground.\n***\n***\n(Additional Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: 1/4 main tank\nOrdnance: N/A\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: N/A\nSerial: 6-83459\nU/C: N/T\nCOMMS: OK\nC/S: OK\nHYD.: OK\nENG:\tLUB: O/K\n\t\t\tCOOL: O/K\n\t\t\tEP: Primed*\n\n(Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n
