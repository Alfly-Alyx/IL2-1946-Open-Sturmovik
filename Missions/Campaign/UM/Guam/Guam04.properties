Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nWe're operating round the clock gentlemen during this crucial period.  The Japanese plan appears to be one of containment of our tenuous positions during daylight hours, and then ferocious counter-attack at night, which they hope will shield them from the worst of our ground fire, air and NGF support.\n***\nTarget for this morning is Bundschu Ridge on the Asan beaches.  The ridge is named for Captain Geary Bundschu, whose Able Company of 1/3 has been assigned this objective.\n***\n1st Battalion took a real pounding from this strongpoint yesterday, with engaged Companies reporting 60% casualties at a minimum.  Unbowed, they're going in again this morning, with jump off timed for 0700.\n***\nWe're assigned to make sure they get a different outcome today.  You will fly in low over the Orote peninsula and dispatch your ordnance onto identified and suspected enemy concentrations.  These will be marked with white smoke.\n***\nYou will then engage in strafing.  Only shoot at what fires back at you.  Our lines are pretty close in, and we don't want to add to the mounting toll of friendlies.\n***\n***\n(Additional Comments): TF58 will be striking Fonte Plateau behind your target.  Avoid interfering with their strike \n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: 1/4 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs HE\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
