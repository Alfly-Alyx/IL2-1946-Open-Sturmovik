Peter F. Schrider\n-----------------------------------\nI'd like to congratulate you men.  This campaign, for all its initial vexations, has been a great success.  This is in no small part due to General Geiger's plans, which were a model of matching firepower with flexibility.  It's also due to every part of the team, no matter how grand or how humble.  And as part of that team you can take credit in your own courage and dedication.\n***\nWe've just heard from Intelligence that Radio Tokyo has announced that only 10% of the island remains in Imperial hands.  It sounds like they're softening up their people for some bad news.\n***\nThat news is going to get even worse, because the Marianas is just about the most strategically important chain of islands in the Pacific.  We can now project our Air and Naval forces right to the Japanese homeland.  Guam is the key to the door to Japan, and you men can take pride in helping wrest it from their hands.\n***\nPretty soon you'll see the first Very Long Range bombers we've all been reading about.  I'm sure looking forward to seeing my first B-29, as I know you all are.  You'll also see the Seabees building up Apra harbor.  The greatest weapon in this theater is our Logistics - it's the muscles that give us the punch.\n***\nNow to today's business.  The enemy has been pushed back to his last redoubt - the prepared positions on the bare slopes of Mount Santa Rosa.  We believe that it is from around this location that the enemy has been dispatching the artillery fire that has harassed our advance.  We have also had reports of both light and medium enemy armor making profitable forays into our forward positions.\n***\nThis is the opportunity to finally terminate organised resistance on the island, and the 77th Division, has graciously invited us to take part.  Their attack is scheduled to jump off at 1200, and we're on close support.\n***\nThis will be your last scheduled strike mission, so let's sign off in style.  We're trialling a new weapon that's come in from the ETO - Napalm.  It's an incendiary fluid, and reports are that unlike previous attempts at this kind of air-dropped weapon, this one actually works.\n***\nYour strike will be co-ordinated with VMF-216, who will arrive from the East, and with Army B-25's from Saipan who will arrive from the opposite direction.  The FCO will call in the three strike elements to cause maximum confusion to the enemy defences.  The Army advance will be right under your strike, so you will exercise rigid fire discipline and not engage in reckless strafing.\n***\n***\n(Additional Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: 1/4 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x Nap.\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
