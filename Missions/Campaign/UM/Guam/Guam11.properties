Peter F. Schrider\n-----------------------------------\n***\nI'm glad to see you men are settling in to life on Orote, despite the privations we're having to endure.  I know many of you are upset about the smell, but we're doing our best to clear the enemy corpses from the perimeter of the field.  I'm afraid we can't do much about the swamp though.  There are just some things we're going to have to live with.\n***\nMAG-21 is the first independent Marine air facility, and it's creation is a result of the lobbying of General Geiger to get his men the organic air support they've sorely lacked in previous campaigns.  We've got to reward the General for his tireless campaigning by being successful in our operations to clear the remaining Japs off Guam and defend it from enemy air predations.\n***\nSo far Phase 2 has been a great success, we've taken 5000 yards in two days - as much as we took in the first week of the campaign.  Admittedly this is mostly because so far the Japanese have been reluctant to come out to play.  That's not true of the native Guamanians, who are only too glad to see us back.\n***\nIt looks like we've met the first attempt by the enemy to defend in strength.  They're making a stand around the village of Barrigada, so let's get our strike operations off to a good start.  You'll be coming in from the East at 600 feet.  VMF-217 will be striking simultaneously from the West in order to confuse AAA.  Keep  to your alloted altitude and schedule so that your strikes maintain adequate seperation.\n***\nM5's will be supporting the assault by 305 and 307 RCT's.  Do not direct fire in the proximity of these friendly forces\n***\n(Additional Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: 1/4 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
