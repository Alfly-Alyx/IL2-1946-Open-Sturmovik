Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nWe managed to land the combat and support elements of the reserve Division last night.  305 Regimental Combat Team of the Army's 77th Division landed in the most precarious manner, due to the lack of shore transport, but nevertheless in good order.\n***\nTheir calm professional approach has impressed the Marines to the point where General Shepherd has started to call them "305th Marines", although the Leathernecks themselves have affectionately started calling them the "Old Bastards" due to their advancing years.\n***\nThey'll be replacing 4th Marines in the line after that unit has taken the O-2.  Part of that objective is Mount Alifan, where the 4th are right at this moment being held back by Japanese positions\n***\nWe're going to help rectify this situation with a strike on these positions.  Make one pass and deliver your HE.  Your strike will be immediately followed up by a battalion assault that will aim to take advantage of enemy confusion.\n***\nProceed to conduct a high-altitude CAP around the Southern tip of the island.  You should be at 12000 feet by Waypoint 5, where you will engage the second stage of your supercharger.  Climb to 20000 feet by Waypoint 6.\n***\nThe enemy has been sending snoopers over on a regular basis, no doubt on the presumption that we cannot intercept at these altitudes.  Well, let's prove them wrong.\n***\nHowever, don't forget the impaired handling of the Corsair when you get this high.  Handle her carefully and don't pull any rash maneuvers.  \n***\n***\n(Additional Comments): Note VT-35 scheduled strike on Orote\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 2 x F4U\nFuel: 1/3 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs HE\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
