Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nDespite last night's tribulations we've managed to link between the assault beaches and now have a unified front.  We're all set to drive to the FBL and beyond.\n***\nIn order to complete Phase 1 of the assault, the first job is to clear the Orote peninsula.  As I'm sure you men are all aware, there is a strong motivation for the Marines to do this.  We've got unfinished business on this part of the island.\n***\nThe area is defended by what's left of the Imperial Navy's troops.  They've already tried to escape by water and we've foiled them in the attempt.  They're now dug in and holding up 1st Marine Brigade's advance.\n***\nThe attack has currently faltered short of RJ15.  The Japanese are firing from prepared positions in pillboxes and brush-hidden mounds.  Armor has been called up in support, but we're going in first to soften up the position.\n***\nDeliver your ordnance on the first run and then egress the target area.  Do not prosecute any attack that endangers friendly forces.\n***\n(Additional Comments): TF58 will be striking the same target.  Be aware of their presence over the target area.\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: 1/4 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs HE\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
