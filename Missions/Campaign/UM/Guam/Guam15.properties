Peter F. Schrider\n-----------------------------------\n\nWell men, General Geiger has finally declared the island secure, so the Expeditionary Force will be handing over to Island Command imminently.  There's only a few rogue bands of Japs still on the island, and we're leaving it to the dog teams to round them up.\n***\nWe're putting a lot of effort right now in housing the native Guamanians.  Many of them were displaced by the Japanese during the nervous few weeks before we arrived, so we're setting up special reservations for them and providing adequate sanitation.\n***\nThere's still plenty of Japs on the island of Rota though, and that's where you're headed this afternoon.  SBD's will be cratering the makeshift runway on the island, and you'll be providing escort.  It should be a nice, easy run for you, as we're told the AA gunners on Rota couldn't hit a horse's ass with their rifle butts.\n***\nI'd like to thank you all to your contribution to this operation.  This is our home now, and we're going to own this entire sector of the Pacific.  May God go with you men, and may you forever take pride in your achievements with the Corps.\n***\n***\n(Additional Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: Full main tank\nOrdnance: N/A\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: N/A\nSerial: 6-83459\nU/C: O/K\nCOMMS: OK\nC/S: OK\nHYD.: O/K\nENG:\tLUB: O/K\n\t\t\tCOOL: O/K\n\t\t\tEP: Primed*\n\n(Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n
