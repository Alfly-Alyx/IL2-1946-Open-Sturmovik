Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nIt's a beautiful day in the Marianas, gentlemen.  We've got ideal flying and target observation conditions, so we're going to make the best of them and give the Leathernecks the maximum opportunity to arrive on Agat safely\n***\nYou will be supporting the assault on beaches Yellow1/Yellow2/White1/White2, as identified during yesterday's briefing.  Flight altitude will be at the discretion of your Flight Leader,but with a prescribed ceiling of 2000 feet.  \n***\nEn route to the target, your course will pass over Transport Area (Southern) and its corresponding LST Launching Area.  If you maintain target time, you should see the first waves setting off.  Don't be shy, let them get a good look at you.\n***\nVT-35 will be hitting frontal enemy positions and targets of opportunity.  Your strike is reserved for identified targets 1000 yards to the rear.  We believe these are assembly areas for any anticipated counter-attack, so our aim is maximum disruption.\n***\nWhen you have delivered your ordnance you will loiter over the target and look for strafing opportunites.\n***\nAn Observation TBF will be monitoring this action.  Any enemy position that reveals itself by opening up on you will be relayed via JASCO.  Naval Gun Fire will then be directed at these targets from Fire Support Areas 4 (Dashiell & Murray) and 6 (Pennsylvania and Johnston).  Fire Support Area 2 will be reserved for area bombardment only.\n***\nNote that NGF will resume at 08.10 exactly.  This will leave you minimum clearance time over the target.  Also be aware that the proximity of our Fire Support vessels will necessitate low-ordinate fire, so any altitude below 300 feet should be considered "at risk".\n***\n***\nAmen.\n***\n*\n(Additional Comments): None\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: 1/4 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs HE\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
