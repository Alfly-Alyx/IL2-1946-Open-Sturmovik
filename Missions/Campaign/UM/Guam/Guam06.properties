Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nWe've established strong positions on the two beacheads, and so far beaten off the best the enemy has thrown at us.  That said, we've not managed to link up the two assaults, so at the moment we're still running two independent campaigns.  There's no reason to panic, but we're not yet in a position to be too optimistic.\n***\nYou're on the dusk CAP this evening.  We know from FORAGER that this is the time of day when the enemy most likes to use what remains of his air elements.  Our suspicion is that these semi-nocturnal raids are staged via the airfield on Pagan, despite the constant harrassment raids by TF58.\n***\nYou will patrol to the Northwest and watch for early nocturnal intruders.  On your return, radar-equipped night fighters will take over this duty.\n***\n(Additional Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 2 x F4U\nFuel: 1/2 main tank\nOrdnance: N/A\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: N/A\nSerial: 6-83459\nU/C: OK\nCOMMS: OK\nC/S: OK\nHYD.: OK\nENG:\tLUB: O/K\n\t\t\tCOOL: O/K\n\t\t\tEP: Primed*\n\n(Comments): Load Point B requires attention\n----------------------------------\n
