Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nSorry to have to get you out of your bunks at this ungodly hour gentlemen, but all Hell has broken loose on the Southern beaches.\n***\nThe Japs have been prosecuting a powerful counter attack all night, with concerted frontal attacks on our forward positions.  We believe that the scale may even be on the Regimental level.  Added to this suicide demolition squads have been taking advantage of the mayhem to penetrate into our rear lines to disable our artillery and communications.\n***\nOur losses have become so grevious that almost anyone from the rear areas who can hold a rifle has been pressed into Company service - we've got shoremen, engineers, medics and even the walking wounded fighting hand to hand with these fanatical attackers.\n***\nArty and NGF have helped us hold the line, but the enemy shows no sign of relenting.  We're going to back them up with a precision strike.\n***\nAs enemy and friendly forces are fighting only yards apart, your strike has to be on the nail.  Forward positions will mark the target with GREEN smoke flares as you approach.  ensure your ordnance is dropped EXACTLY on the target.  Do not engage in any ground strafing, no matter how tempted you may be.\n***\nThe issue is at hand gentlemen.  The balance of this operation may rest on the next few hours and minutes.  I know that you can be relied upon to fulfil your duties.\n***\nMay God go with you.\n***\n(Additional Comments): None\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 2 x F4U\nFuel: 1/4 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs HE\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
