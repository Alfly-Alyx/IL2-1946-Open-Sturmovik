Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nOur forces landed successfully at 08.32 this morning and have been making mixed progress on their respective beaches.  The unpredicatibility of both enemy strength and intentions, and the actual nature of the terrain in detail, mean that though we have established and maintained positions in depth, the line is spread thinly in both assault areas.\n***\nWe're hitting the Agat beachead again in support of 1st Provisional Marines' drive to the O-1 line.\n***\nThe Brigade S-3 has selected three targets for neutralisation.  Each one will require a pinpoint strike, due either to the embedded nature of the enemy, or the proximity of friendly forces.  \n***\nYour priority target is the Japanese guns around Facpi point, which are delivering a steady stream of high-ordinate HE onto the White beaches.  Second target is the town of Agat, which is due to be invested by assault elements of 1/22 as they swing to the North.  Keep a careful watch for their forward elements.  Navy strafing has already resulted in friendly casualties, and we don't want to cause any more.\n***\nFinal target is Bangi point, which has been alloted to elements of TF58.  Make sure they do a good job, and if necessary suppress any hostile elements that survive their action.\n***\nYou will approach Facpi Point from the Southwest, passing over Fire Support Area 2, who will suspend firing on your approach.  Please note that the smoke caused by the NGF has reduced visibility across the target area, increasing the difficulty of both target identification and damage assessment.  Observation planes will therefore be flying at reduced altitude.  Be vigilant of their presence in the area.\n***\n(Additional Comments): None\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 2 x F4U\nFuel: 1/4 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs HE\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
