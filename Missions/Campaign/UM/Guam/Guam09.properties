Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nIt's another strike on Orote this afternoon gentlemen.  This time the target is the Marine barracks and rifle range.\n***\nWe should never err from reminding ourselves that Guam is United States' territory that has been ransacked by the Japanese in their crazed policy of aggression.\n***\nThe barracks have been the preserve of your fellow Marines on the island since 1898, and good men died defending it when the Empire invaded.  Well now we're going to grab what's left of it back.\n***\nWe're trying something different this afternoon - a dive bombing run.  The enemy has plenty of weaponry at this end of the peninsula.  We're diving to confuse the gunners.  VT-35 will be striking simultaneously from low altitude.  If we do this right, the Japs won't know where to look.\n***\nA note of caution is necessary, however.  We're diving from 15000 feet, but there may be cloud over the target at 5000 feet.  If you can't see the target, you are urged to hold your nerve and penetrate the cloud cover before releasing your munitions.\n***\nAfter you've laid your eggs you may join the TBF's in strafing any targets that identify themselves.  M4's of 1st Brigade are scheduled to arrive in the target area from 14.30 onwards, so cease strafing on their appearance.\n***\n(Additional Comments): \nRefresh yourself with the dive-bombing drill.  Remember only to commence your dive when prompted by your leader:\n\n*Throttle back to zero\n*Turn nose over\n*Engage dive brakes\n*Sight your target and adjust with elevator trim\n*The moment the target steadies in your sights, release ordnance\n*Retract brakes and pull up as gently as possible\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: 1/4 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs HE\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
