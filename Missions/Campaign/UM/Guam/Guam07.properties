Col. James A. Embrey, Jr.\n-----------------------------------\n***\nIt's been another long night on the island for both 3rd Division and 1st Provisional Brigade.  The enemy has been making strong counter-attacks all along the line, aided by darkness and the squally rain showers that have been hitting the island all night.\n***\nMost serious has been in the North, ahead of the Fonte Plateau.  The enemy has brought reserves forward and conducted a well thought out attack against all Battalions.  They probed the line early in the evening looking for weak spots and then returned in force.  It's been a close-run thing, but Corps artillery aided by illumination from star shells and destroyer searchlights has helped break up most of the attacks\n***\nThe other main enemy thrust has come from the swamps on the Orote peninsula.  The only thing predictable about the Nipponese is that he is unpredictable.  His Orote offensive has been as badly planned and executed as his Fonte one was well-executed.  Reports coming in suggest that the Japs on Orote spent the early part of the evening getting drunk on Sake and then ran into our guns in crazed state of frenzy.  Commanders on the ground strongly suspect they were more keen to die for the Emperor than take any of us with them.\n***\nNaturally, we obliged them.\n***\nThe rains squalls are dying down now, so we're going into action.  You will add to the enemy's discomfort by striking the remnants of their positions around Fonte.  Green flares will mark the target.\n***\n(Additional Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 2 x F4U\nFuel: 1/2 main tank\nOrdnance: 2 x 500lbs HE\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: Min.
