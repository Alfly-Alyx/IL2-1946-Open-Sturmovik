Peter F. Schrider\n-----------------------------------\n***\nIt's time we gave our ships a thorough workout, men.  Our ground offensive is maintaining its momentum against limited enemy opposition, so we've got time to start patrolling the area more aggressively.\n***\nYour mission this morning is a recon in force over the enemy-held island of Rota.  We believe that the enemy is using its delapidated base there to stage their attacks.  This is despite constant harrassment from both the Navy, and from Army planes based on Saipan.\n***\nWe've only had a few radar contacts since we came ashore, and I know you're all itching for some splashes.  Let's hope the Emperor is obliging during this patrol.\n***\n***\n(Additional Comments): N/A\n----------------------------------\n\n----------------------------------\nCrew Chief Report\n----------------------------------\nFlight: 3 x F4U\nFuel: 1/2 main tank\nOrdnance: N/A\nGuns: \tI/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\n\t\t\t\tO/B Full Load w/tracer (synch.)\nArmorers Notes: N/A\nSerial: 6-83459\nU/C: O/K 2nd Test\nCOMMS: OK\nC/S: OK\nHYD.: N/T\nENG:\tLUB: O/K\n\t\t\tCOOL: O/K\n\t\t\tEP: Primed*\n\n(Comments): Trim checked OK.
