One of it's attacks sunk the Yorktown.\n\nIn the south, west of Midway an enemy carrier group around the Shokaku was attacked by the Midway Air Group in the morning two times. The light carrier which was part of this group is reported to be sunk.\nThe Shokaku is estimated to be damaged.\nAt the moment this group is sailing west.\n\nNow a third enemy carrier croup was sighted north of the Kure Atoll. It is formed around the Akagi and is consiting another light carrier.\n\nThis third group was ordered to be attacked from the Midway Air Group immediately.\nIn these minutes the Enterprise is launching two attack waves against the northern Hiryu Group.\n\nThe decision will be made in the next two hours.\nIt is essential that enough enemy forces will be damaged or destroyed to make a landing at Midway impossible.\n\nThe next raids will turn the tide or lose the battle.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nAttack the enemy light carrier with bombs.\n\nTime: 14:15\nAltitude: 9000ft\nFlight: Longbow- Three\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
