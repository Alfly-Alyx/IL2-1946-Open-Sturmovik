You quickly became familar with the new machine.\n\nWhen Rosenberg saw your capabilities, he promoted you to his fourth flight leader.\nWhat an honor for a former dive bomber pilot!\n\nFirst you were argued by other pilots. Your F4U shows only four kill markings but when Maj. Rosenberg declared that your 'only' four kills were achieved with a slow and clumsy SBD you got a little more respect.\n\nHowever you will have to show that your position as a flight leader was a right decision.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nSink the burning freighter wreck with bombs.\n\nTime: 16:00\nAltitude: 6000ft\nFlight: Archer- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear. Fresh winds.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
