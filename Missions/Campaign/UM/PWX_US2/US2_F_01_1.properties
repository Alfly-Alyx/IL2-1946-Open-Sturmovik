Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nMidway Islands / Kure Atoll\n\nJune 3rd, 1942\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThree days on board of the Yorktown.\n\nOur intelligence is estimating that the Japanese Navy is planning to launch an operation against Midway. Admiral Nimitz ordered the remaining carriers to counter that threat.\n\nIn this course your squadron was ordered to transfer to Midway too. The planes of your squadron were loaded onto the Enterprise and the Yorktown.\nAll preperations were made when two days ago an American submarine spotted a Japanese Carrier Group near the Marianas on course to the south.\nTo counter an eventual threat at New Guinea or Australia,the Saratoga was redirected to the Coral Sea, where it shall form up with the Wasp.\n\nNow the Naval Force assigned to guard Midway contains only two carriers: The Yorktown and the Enterprise.\n\nWith the sighting of an enemy carrier group sailing south it's very questionable that any Japanese naval forces are really on the way to Midway too.\n\nOn the other hand the enemy has the strength to attack at two places simultaneously.\nWho knows?\nFog of war.\n\nAdmiral Nimitz is believing in Midway to be the target for an enemy attack.\n\nAt around 11:00 the ships will reach Midway.\nYour squadron is ordered to start your transfer to Midway now.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nTransfer to your new airfield at Midway.\n\nTime: 08:00\nAltitude: 3000ft\nFlight: Longbow- Three\n\nWeather Forecast:\nStrong winds, hazy.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
