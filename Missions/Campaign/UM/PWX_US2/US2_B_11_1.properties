Now you're the first dive bomber pilot been credited with an aireal victory.\nCongratulations!\n\nThe enemy air raid against Wake made great destructions. Our main repair facilities are totally destroyed. More than 40 percent of the planes on the ground have been destroyed.\n\nThe enemy planes came clearly from at least two enemy carriers.\n\nUntil now these enemy carrier group's position couldn't be detected.\nBut the exact position of a group of enemy battleships is!\n\nThese battleships are a bad threat to our base, as much as the enemy planes are. If they come close enough, they will be able to bombard our airfield with gunfire.\n\nGeneral Ross has ordered attacks against these battleships. \nTwenty minutes ago a raid of  Marines- SBDs against the battleships was met by enemy fighters and had to suffer great losses.\nHopefully the enemy fighter defense is somewhat unorganized now.\n\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nAttack one of the enemy battleships with bombs.\n\nTime: 07:30\nAltitude: 8000ft\nFlight: Palmtree- Three\n\nWeather forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
