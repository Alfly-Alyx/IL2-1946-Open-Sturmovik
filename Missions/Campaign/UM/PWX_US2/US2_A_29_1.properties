Into the hospital.\n\nThree long months.\nBannert's daughter was your nurse.\nYou imagined how he had 'ordered' her to care for you.\n\n\nThen, two weeks ago you were released from the hospital.\nGeneral Bannert waited for you to thank you for all you did.\nHe thanked you, but you had to thank him for saving your life. There were paratroopers, injured not as serious as you, who were left behind to hold on the followers.\nMany disappeared, but you were carried through the whole jungle by his men and by himself.\n\nDuring your staying at the hospital General Bannert had to go to three hearings about the whole affair.\n\nAt the end it was General Douglas McArthur and President Roosevelt who cared for Bannert to get a command in New Guinea again.\n\nA good outcome for Bannert and a good outcome for you.\n\nThe head command decided that your flying the General to the pocket without the permission of any other higher authorities was an act enforced by the special situation.\nIn other words, it was decided that Bannert and you are heroes and not a criminals.\n\nPolitics. Propaganda. Great!\n\nAt the end Bannert asked you if he could do something for you. 'Of course!' you said and asked him if he could help you to be transfered to a fighter unit.\nBannert said that he will go up to the President if it's nescessary to help you.\n\nSince today you're back  to duty.\nYou were assigned to the dive bomber school at Ford Island for the next four weeks.\nThe teachers want to gather practical informations from you.\n\nWhen you entered the school, a surprise waited for you. To honor you the teachers had organized a small party.\n\nFinally, in the afternoon, you got time to make a flight. The first flight since nearly four months.\nThree rookies will fly with you.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nEnjoy the flight.\n\nTime: 17:15\nAltitude: free\nFlight: Archer- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear afternoon.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
