Europe is standing in flames and the relationships with Japan are becoming worse and worse.\n\nYou wanted to stand for your country when the war begins. You wanted to give your country what you can best: Flying a plane!\n\nAs an aerobatic pilot you flew more than 1500 hours at air shows since four years. You showed hundreds of times that youre able to control even the fastest planes.\n\nAnd what did the Navy- bureaucrats say?\nToo old!\nPerhaps usable to fly carrier dive bombers.\nBut too old to fly fighters.\n\nNow you're sitting in an SBD-3 dive bomber. \nWith you on the runway: \nWildcats, flown by young men who saw the inside of a plane 12 months ago for the first time.\nIt's crazy. You're only too sure that you would be able to control such a fighter better than all these boys together.\nBut the Navy made a bomber pilot out of you.\n\nAfter six months of flight training on the SBD you, your bomber comrades and the boys with the fighters will make your first carrier landing.\n\nThe Lexington is cruising south of Oahu and is awaiting you....\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFly to the Lexington and land on it.\n\nTime: 10:15\nAltitude: 1500ft\nFlight: Vulcan- Two\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
