Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 10th, 1942\n\n===================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nDuring the night our long awaited reinforcements will arrive. They are desperately needed.\n\nThe overall situation is not good.\n\nThe Wairopi pocket will make it only a few days.\nIn front of Kokoda the enemy is getting stronger. The advance to make a connection with the airborne troops failed. The encircled troops will have to break out by their own force. It's clear that a great number of them won't get out there.\n\nAt Etogi and Naura the picture is looking better.\nAllthough both positions are still encircled it can be hoped that their garrisons will be able to survive until the reinforcements come to the front.\n\nIn the centre the Japanese have reached Kalikodobu. At the moment our defenses at the place are holding the enemy's advance but it's clear that the resistance can't hold out for long.\nIt must be estimated that the Japanese will reach the coast at Kapa Kapa in the coming days.\nIf this happens, our thin line at the Owen Stanley Ridge must be withdrawn. Then the Japanese will have placed themselves between Port Moresby and the Milne Region.\n\nIn the east the situation is not more promising.\nOur troops at the Wanigela area will be cut off from their connection to Milne within the next 20 hours.\nAs many troops as possible are about to be drawn back, but the door cen't be held open for long enough. The Command is building up an evacuation plan to get out the men by sea ferry.\n\nThe Port Moresby Air Group is ordered to support the ground troops as good as possible.\nYour squadron is ordered to attack the enemy at Kalikodobu.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nAttack the enemy artillery with bombs.\n\nTime: 08:13\nAltitude: 6500ft\nFlight: Longbow- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny, strong winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
