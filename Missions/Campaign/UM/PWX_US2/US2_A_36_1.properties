The plane is going into mass production in America.\nYou feared that you will have to say goodbye to your friends from the Navy Carrier Fighter Squadron VF-39.\nBut two days ago you got new orders.\n\nToday you shall go onboard the Essex for a new carrier operation. Together with VF-39!\n\nBoth squadrons aren't at full strength. Every unit is owning only 18 F4Us at the moment. Together this is the perfect strength for a Carrier Fighter Contingent and so both squads were assigned to the Essex.\nThe F4U shall prove it's value in battle.\n\nNobody knows any details about the coming operation but anyway, you got more time with good comrades.\n\nA new battle.\nWill you come back?\nWill your good friends come back?\n\nA strong carrier group consisting the Essex, the Saratoga and the Hornet have left Pearl Harbor one hour ago.\nThree carriers!\nThat only can mean: offensive action.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFly to the carrier group and land on the Essex.\n\nTime: 07:30\nAltitude: 3000ft\nFlight: Archer- Four\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny early morning.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
