Name        WOW   (US2)   -=ARCHER=-
Description \nYou're Alex Brandt\n\nYou were seven years old when your father had let you overtake the controls of his plane for the first time.\nYou were fifteen when you had made your first take off and it was only a few weeks later when he had let you make your first landing.\nOnly a year later you flew alone for the first time.\nNobody mustn’t know that and nobody ever did.\n\nWhen you were old enough you made your license in only ten days and it took only half a year to become known as a gifted show pilot.\n\nYou flew often.\nYou flew fast.\nYou flew the most difficult manouvers and you flew with a dead engine.\nYou flew day by day and you grew older.\n\nWhen the coming war overshadowed your country you wanted to be ready.\nTo help your country.\nTo fight the evil.\nAnd to shoot down enemy planes.\n\nYou enlisted to the US Marine’s flying school.\nYou were the best pilot of them all.\nMostly better than your teachers.\nYou quickly learned that your abilities were argued by some of your teachers and you recognized that some of them didn’t like you.\nAt the end you got the bill:\n\nToo old!\nYou were seven years older than your comrades.\nThey said that you were too old to fly fighters.\nYou knew that you could beat them all on a fighter’s stick but they wanted you to drop bombs.\nWhen you protested they said that you can select the pilot’s seat of a dive bomber or the chair behind a desk.\n\nYou got no chance.\nAnd you took it.\nBetter a chair with wings than a chair with a cushion.\n\nBut you didn’t give up.\nYou made a second request.\nOne request too much.
