Nimitz' Naval Forces are forced to play a supporting role for this time.\nNot before the end of 1943 the Navy will be strengthened enough for a major offensive in the Central Pacific by Naval Forces.\nUntil then, the southern flank will have to be the main focus of operations. The Navy's aim will be to keep the lines of supplies open.\n\nIn this strategical concept, the taking of Guadalcanal ist the first step.\nBefore an offensive in New Guinea can be launched, the control of Guadalcanal is essential as it threatens the supply lines from America to New Guinea.\n\nOn the Island the Japanese are operating an airfield at Lunga. This airfield is the major target for the upcoming operation "Shoestring".\n\nThe US- Forces are split up into three groups:\n\nGroup1 is the landing force which will conduct an amphibious landing in the Koli Bay, east of Lunga at the northern coast of Guadalcanal.\nThe group consits several older battleships and the transport fleet containing the reinforced 1st Marine Division.\n\nGroup2 is the air support force.\nIt contains our four left fleet carriers and two light carriers. It's main objective: The neutralisation of the enemy air forces and then the support of the 1st Marine Division's ground operations.\nAfter the capture of the Lunga airfield the Marines Air Group will be deployed at that field and will be subordinated under the Marines ground forces.\n\nGroup 3 is the battleship force.\nIt is ordered to prepare and to support the landing operation with artillery fire. \n\n\nDuring the night, the Air Support Group reached a position southeast, close to Guadalcanal.\nThe Group was split up into two squadrons:\nSquad Enterprise with the Saratoga and Squad Wasp, sailing together with the Hornet.\n\nIn the early morning the first act of Operation Shoestring will start: \nThe Air Raids against Lunga and Tulagi.\n\nSunrise in 45 minutes.\nYou are ordered to patrol along the route of the group to attack any hostile surface vessel you encounter which could warn the Guadalcanal defense.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nPatrol along the plotted course.\nAttack all enemy vessels you encounter.\n\nTime: 04:35\nAltitude: 4500ft\nFlight:  Longbow- Three\n\nWeather Forecast:\nEarly morning haze, mediocre windspeed.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
