Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nTarawa Atoll...... \n\nJune 4th, 1942\n\n==================\n\nSITUATIONAL REPORT:\n\nThe last 90 minutes brought bad luck!\n\nThe attacks on Tarawa's radar installations went good.\nAll following air strikes didn't.\n\nAt the same time when the radar stations were attacked an air raid by 24 B-14 bombers was intercepted south of Tarawa by enemy fighters.\n\nIn a short time 17 B-24s were shot down, three damaged. The raid didn't reach Betio Airfield. At the moment the surviving bombers are on their way back to Guadalcanal.\n\nThis important mission affected the following air raids because the enemy was able to launch his fighters at will.\n\nBoth air strikes conducted from the Saratoga Task Group  failed and suffered great losses.\nAt both occasions the enemy had at least a dozen fighters airborne to intercept our attacks.\n\nUntil now Betio Airfield seems to be only lightly damaged.\nUntil Task Group is ready to launch a second strike wave, the Essex was ordered to launch an airstrike combined of SBD-5 dive bombers and F4U fighters.\n\nYou're with it.\nThe SBDs are up and have entered their mission altitude. Now you can take off.....\n\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nEscort the dive bombers to Betio Island Airfield.\n\nTime: 05:10\nAltitude:10000ft\nFlight: Blue Bravo- Four\n\nWeather forecast:\nSunny early morning.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
