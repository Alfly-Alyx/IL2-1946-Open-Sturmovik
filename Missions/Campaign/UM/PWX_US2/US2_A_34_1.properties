Along with our new F4U the Army Air Force is testing two other plane types.\n\nThe 7th Fighter Squadron aces\nWillard 'Monkey' Buhler with 57 aireal victories,\nEric 'Vampire' Dolphy with 43 kills and\nDiego 'Torrero' Marsalis with 32 victories are testing the new, wonderful looking twinmot fighter Lockheed P-38 Lightning. \nThe most beautiful plane you ever saw.\n\nThe 44th Fighter Squadron aces are flying another new Army Air Force Fighter Type:\nThe P-47 Thunderbolt. \nIt's definately the biggest single engine fighter in the world.\nIt's commander, the mysterious Major Ary 'Angel' von Ylmond is a strange character. He's a little bit like a saint. Angel! That fits.\nHe is America's top ace with 67 kills.\nWith him at Wheeler:\nDan 'Dragon' Coltrane with 44 victories and\nTerence 'Red Devil' Dix with 36 kills.\n\nBoth squads came from New Guinea. It seems that the place changes the minds of men.\nHowever, strange or not, they are great airmen and even greater comrades.\nAnd.... never try to achieve a victory against Major 'Monkey' Buhler in a drinking- battle. \nYou'll die.\n\nBut the most time you are spending together with the guys from VF-39.\nMajor Rosenberg assigned it's commander and leading ace Major Ray 'Cat Ball' Palmer for his instruction on the new F4U to you.\n\nOf course he first looked a little astonished at your four kill markings on your plane and he surely asked himself why you were selected to instruct him and not one of the  aces. But the next day, he spent the evening with Pat. He wanted to know how you made the kills with a dive bomber.\n\nThe days passed and you and Palmer began to like each other. He has an awful reputation. Somewhat like that of Giacomo Casanova. \nBut yesterday he told you his story about a girl he can't forget and about her father, a General who tried to destroy his career right before it just begun.\nYou were really surprised to hear that this General was nobody else than George Bannert, your friend from New Guinea. Palmer talked about his daughter, Sarah.\nYour nurse!\nPalmer seemed to be really in love. \nCould it be that his gigolo- reputation is wrong?\nOr did his character make a change?\n\nWhatever, you decided to find out more about his real intentions before you help him.\nYou want to be sure if he's worth to get another chance with the general's daughter.\n\nFor today you gave him the 'order' to train carrier landings with you...\n\nLet's play a little bit ball-\nwith the ball playing cat's  balls.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nLand on the Essex.\n\nTime: 10:00\nAltitude: 5000ft\nFlight: Archer- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
