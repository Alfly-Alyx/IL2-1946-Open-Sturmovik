Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 5th, 1942\n\n===================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe landing zone at Wairopi seems to be stabilized at the moment. The few Japanese attacks from the outside on the pocket were beaten off easily.\n\nGood news. \n\nOn the other hand the top of the wooded hill in the centre of the landing zone is still held by a small Japanese force and all attempts to overwhelm it didn't succeed until now.\nThe hill was named 'Bullseye' because it's looking like one when drawn on a map. In the meantime the whole landing zone is called so.\n\nBad news.\n\nThe Yodda - Kokoda attack group is making good progress. Since yesterday the attack was carried about 6 miles to the southeast.\n\nAgain good news.\n\nBut 80 minutes ago we got the message that the enemy is attacking at Etogi in force. The Etogi commander is unsure if he'll be able to defend the stronghold. The situation is critical.\n\nBad news\n\nTo counter this new situation, air support is beeing organized.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nAttack the enemy north of Etogi with bombs.\n\nTime: 06:32\nAltitude: 7500ft\nFlight: Longbow- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny, clearing up.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
