Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 4th, 1942\n\n====================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nSince the early morning wave after wave of transports were flying troops and supplies into the landing zone.\nSince the first light the enemy is attacking the planes with great ferocity.\nThe transport's losses are devestating.\nOver 35 C-47s were shot down over the zone, more than 40 planes are damaged.\nBut over 3000 men were dropped off with a sufficient amount of supplies.\nThey will be enough to be a hard nut to crack for the enemy.\nThe Wairopi- Kokoda- road is cut off.\nAt the moment the Japanese have not enough troops in the area to effectively attack the paras.\n\nThe situation at Etogi is still critical. An all out assault was beaten off in the morning with the use of the last reserves. But every enemy attack at Etogi will make the Japanese supply situation worse.\n\nNow our airborne troops have to be supported at all costs. Our ship convoy is on the way. \n \nIn these minutes our airborne troops managed to establish a provisoric runway in the western part of the landing zone. This enables the transports to fly in supplies which can't be dropped off.\n\nThe first C-47s have landed just  15 minutes ago.\nAt the moment they're beeing unloaden.\nSoon they will have to take off again.\nAnd they're in danger. Still enemy forces are in the forest east of the airstrip.\nThese have to be attacked.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nAttack the enemy forces in the forest.\n\nTime: 08:14\nAltitude: 9000ft\nFlight: Longbow- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny morning, strong winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
