Coffeen ever since his Corsair was seen splashing down into the Slot, but PBY Patrols go up every few hours to recon for pilots. Hope isnt lost Vedder was returned to Cactus after having been missing for some time. There is a Dumbo set to take off early this morning from the Rangers small anchorage in the muddy Matanikau river delta, to continue the search for missing marine pilots, and more specifically to pick up some survivors of a B-24 crash at Segi, the same place Vedder was found by coastwatchers. After a little finagling you manage to trade places with the Dumbo co-pilot for this trip, especially since you were not scheduled to fly today. The Dumbo is set to land at Tulagi SPB after the mission, where you can catch a boat back to Cactus. Meanwhile on New Georgia the 4th Marine Raider Battalion has marched overland from Segi Point, wading through knee-deep mud as they fought Japanese all through the trek, finally reaching and seizing Viru Harbor on the western coast of southeastern New Georgia yesterday. At Wickham Anchorage on Vangunu Island operations required four days to overcome weather, terrain and the Japanese.\n\nWar Diary:\n\nJune 27, 1943\n\n- 0715 1030 Escort Dumbo Mission 4 F4Us.\nMajor Weissenberger, Lts. Thomas, Vedder, and Peck, rendezvoused with PBY over the field, then proceeded to Segi. The PBY flew very low, about 300 feet, Lt. Treffers flight furnished low cover, about 500 feet above the PBY and the other flight (Major Weissenbergers) furnished high cover at 4,000 feet. On reaching Segi the PBY landed, while the F4Us Circled overhead. A number of small boats were observed going to and from the PBY. The PBY stayed on the water for about 35 minutes, then took off. Major Weissenbergers plane had battery trouble, but he was able to stay with the flight and on landing his plane, a tire blew out, but he was able to land safely.\n\n1100 into the tent walked a bearded man with Staff in hand, wearing blue coveralls, looking as though he had just walked in from his still in the mountains of Tennessee. At first no one recognized him, then one of the boys jumped to his feet and grabbed the bearded man by his hand and exclaimed, Coffeen, Im glad to see you! To the delight of everyone it was Staff Sergeant William T. Coffeen, who had taken off, in the darkness of the morning of April 13 and had been forced down near Choiseul Island.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
