Marines of the 169th Infantry have reported Japanese aircraft are still making repeated trips to drop munitions on our Artillery batteries on Rendova, although mainly at night as they have learned of the deadly accuracy of the 9th Defense Battalions AAA guns. Division I will head out on Dowser today keep and eye out for enemies. Keep the patrol pattern above twenty thousand feet to aid in interceptions.\n\nWar Diary:\n\nJuly 11, 1943\n\nThe above two divisions took off at 1220 to conduct the Dowser Patrol, arriving on station at 1300. They conducted the patrol at 25,000 feet over Rendova, Munda and Kula Gulf area until 1430 when on a southerly course over Kula Gulf they sighted a number of Zeros at about 18,000 feet over Kusage Point, New Georgia. About 1440 the patrol made their initial contact with the Zeros. Lt. DeFabio joined on Major Weissenberger as he made a pass on a Zero from up Sun. The Major fired a burst into the Zero, starting it to smoke. Lt. Boag went into the initial attack with Captian Cloake, but became separated. Soon after a Zero got on Cloakes tail, Boag turned on the Zero and started shooting it, causing parts to fly from its hood and cowling. Boag had to leave this Zero to go after another Zero that was on the rail of a Corsair and passed in front of him. He dove on the tail of this Zero and raked it fore and aft. The Zero went down smoking, but Boag could no longer observe it because there was a Zero now on his tail. The Zero shot a number of 20mm holes in Boags wings. Other Zeros got on Boags tail and shot holes all through his plane. His oil line was shot out and he succeeded in reaching a point off Segi, where he bailed out. In the process of bailing out he lost two fingers as a result of the aerials hitting his hand. He was picked up by boat from Segi and returned to base on July 23, 1943.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
