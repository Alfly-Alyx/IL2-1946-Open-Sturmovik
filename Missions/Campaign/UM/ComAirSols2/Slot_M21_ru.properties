F4U-1s of division I have been chosen to escort 3 R4Ds from Cactus as they head to the northwest end of New Georgia in order to drop food, ammunition, and medical supplies to Marine Raiders. Progress for the Marines on New Georgia has been slow. The difficult terrain, the absence of tactical intelligence regarding Japanese defenses, and the physical depletion of the troops has hindered their advance. Weighted down with equipment and ammunition, the men have forded rain-swollen river and streams. Between waterways, they have slogged through mangrove swamps, struggling to stay upright while trying to find their way without accurate maps. Soldiers in the lead platoons have had to cut their way through the tangles of rattan vines that knot the jungle. Narrow trails force units to advance in single-file columns, churning the trails into mud and allowing a few hidden Japanese to slow the advance. Things are worse though for the 3d Battalion, 148th Infantry. After breaking off from the line of march of the 1st Raiders on 6 July, the soldiers had moved over equally difficult terrain to assume their blocking position on the Munda-Bairoko Trail on 8 July. After initial success against surprised Japanese patrols, the Army battalion fought a bloody action against an enemy force of similar strength that pushed the American soldiers off high ground and away from the important trail. Illness and Casualties have sapped their manpower which is why it is so important that we re-supply this isolated unit from the air.\n\nWar Diary:\n\nJuly 9, 1943\n\nFour flights took off at 0545 to furnish cover for out task force in Blanche Channel. On reaching Vangunu Island our planes ran into Bad Weather consisting of thunderheads, rain, and heavy wind. This intense weather continued as far up as Tetapari Island. The weather over Rendova and Munda this morning was nearly as bad. Halls flight was the only outfit to locate the task force and only after a prolonged search, finally locating the taskforce when flying at an altitude of 500 feet off the eastern coast of New Georgia near Segi. All divisions returned and were pancaked by 0845. Dumbo escort mission requested and pending improving weather.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
