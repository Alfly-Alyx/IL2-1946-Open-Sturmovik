Description The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\t\nDate: 4/21/43\nTime: 1700\nWind: 10mph west\nClouds: 2/3 broken @ 5,000 feet\nLocn:\tCactus\nTask:\tEvening Knucklehead Patrol\n\nOrders:\n\n21 April, Two F4U-1s of division I will conduct an evening patrol of Knucklehead and Cactus. Patrol objective is to quiet the night air raids on Cactus, that usually consist of one, or a consecutive series of single Japanese bombers which circle the field as long as they can, dropping a bomb once in a while to keep everyone nervous or at least awake. Generally the plane is a twin engine "Betty" sent down from the northern airfields. The pilots of these planes will intentionally unsynchronize their engines so that they make a peculiarly annoying sound, which some likened to a washing machine, hence the nickname "Washing Machine Charlie", or "Maytag Charlie". \n\nWar Diary:\n\nApril 21, 1943\n\n- 0530 Alert 8 F4U.\n- 0740 0935 Eight F4Us led by Major Leary escorted two PB4Ys on photo mission to Santa Isabel Island.\n- 1710 1900 two F4Us Knucklehead Patrol Major Leary, Lieutenant McCleary.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
