Description The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\t\nDate: 5/08/43\nTime: 0915\nWind: 9mph, gusty\nClouds: Mostly Cloudy, Rain below 1,500 ft.\nLocn:\tFighter One\nTask: Scout and Strike Ships in Blackett Strait\n\nOrders:\n\n8 May, Sixteen F4U-1s set to join an anti-shipping strike. PBY aircraft have sent a report of a Japanese Cruiser(CL), and Destroyer(DD) fifty miles southwest of Vila, in the Blackett Strait heading southeast towards the New Georgia Island group. Eight F4U-1s are to proceed ahead of main strike force to survey the target area and if the skies are clear, they are to use  the new skip bombing technique for attack on enemy vessels. Be sure to have the line chief check for delayed fuses on your bombs. The other eight F4U-1s of VMF-213 will stick close to the main strike force all the way in and out of the target area.\n\nWar Diary:\n\nMay 8, 1943\n\nOn the night of May 6th, the Navy sent two task forces consisting of three light cruisers escorted by four destroyers and the other of four mine layers, to mine the waters in the vicinity of Munda Point, off New Georgia and Vila on Kolumbangara. This was accomplished under cover of darkness and proved to be most successful, as word received this morning that some Jap ships had struck the mines. The report as to number and types of Jap ships was not definite. A striking force was immediately organized and dispatched at 0930 to Blackett Strait to attempt to sink the crippled Jap ships. Twenty-one SBDs and TBFs with an adequate fighter escort proceeded to the task. Bad weather was encountered on the south side of New Georgia on the way up and some of the fighters became separated from the bombers and returned to base. The division that returned was Major Humberds and included Lts. Spoede, Cupp, and Peck. VMF 213 furnished 16 F4Us for this mission to provide cover for the bombers to and from the target and to circle the target and protect the bombers as they recovered from their dives at the target. Heavy, cumulus clouds extended from 1000 to 3000 feet with about seven tenths coverage. There were two ships in the strait, one sitting dead in the water and identified as a destroyer leader, and the other aground on a reef identified as a destroyer. There were many small boats on another reef about a mile north of the grounded destroyer and Japs were observed among those boats. Of the twenty one bombs dropped, only one hit was observed and that was on the bow of the destroyer leader. However, throughout the attack, automatic AA was encountered from the small boats and other ships. All planes returned by 1330.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
