Short The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\t\nDate:\t6/23/43\nTime:\t1400\nWind:\tLight and variable\nClouds: Clear\nLocn:\tFighter One\nTask:\tRendova Strike\n\nOrders:\n\n23 June, Four F4U-1s of division I are assigned to fly strike over Rendova Island. Reports claim that the Japanese are moving men to the Island by barge, from Munda Point to Rendova Harbor on the northwestern shore. Targets also include enemy encampments near the harbor anchorages. Take note that division IV is on Knucklehead Patrol. Also note that Operation TOENAILS (the invasion of New Georgia) started three days ago when Marines, followed by Army forces the next day, landed at Segi Point on Vangunu Island, adjacent to New Georgia to the southeast. There were other preliminary landings, made at Wickham Anchorage on Vangunu, at Viru Harbor, and the Bairoko Harbor areas of New Georgia. For TOENAILS, Rear Admiral R. K. Turner had divided his forces into two task groups. Western Force is to seize Rendova soon, and eventually Munda. The Eastern Force, under Rear Admiral G. H. Fort was the force that was directed to capture Wickham Anchorage, Segi Point, and Viru Harbor. VMF-213 is going to be assigned to protect Western Force as it lands on, and occupies Rendova. Such will be necessary because the Rendova heights will provide positions for our 155mm Long Tom artillery to pound Munda Point, along with protecting against Japanese Men-of-War, and providing fire support to Western Force when it lands on New Georgia. \n\nWar Diary:\n\nJune 23, 1943\n\nAt 0700 Lts. Hall, Shaw, Morgan, and Jones, along with Captain Cloake, Lts. McCleary, Boag, and Tate provided escort for 8 B-25s and 6 TBFs. Went down with 2000 lbs Daisy Cutters. Weather was poor, and the route up and back was circuitous. AA fire was drawn from Munda both going and returning.  Both flights were pancaked by 1100. Major Weissenberger expressed himself emphatically about the poor leadership which caused the flights to be taken over Munda, for no reason, where heavy AA fire endangered the pilots. At 1500 Lt.Col. Moore, of Fighter Command, took No. 2 to the Russells, landing there at 1530. He took off again at 1545, pancaking here at 1615. At 1400 Lts. Hall, Shaw, Morgan, and Jones bombed enemy positions on Rendova.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
