Description The Chalkboard:\n\nSqn: VMF-213 Hellhawks\t\nDate:\t4/25/43\nTime:\t1000\nWind:\tVariable and gusty \nClouds: 3/4 broken @ 1,500 feet\nLocn:\tCactus\nTask:\tEscort and Strike Vanga Vanga\n\nOrders:\n\n25 April, Twelve F4U-1s of divisions I, III, and IV led by Major Weissenberger will rendezvous with six SBDs over Savo Island at 3,000 feet, and then climb to a transit altitude of 17,000 feet as strike force proceeds with attack on Vila. Division I led by Major Payton will fly ahead of the main strike and break away in the Munda area, drop over the Blackett Strait, and make a straffing runs on enemy positions at the village of Vanga Vanga on the northwestern coast of Kolombangara, and any barges nearby. VMF-123s Wildcats are flying local patrol.\n\n\nWar Diary:\n\nApril 25, 1943\n\n- 0530 Alert 12 F4U.\n- 1010 1335 Escort of SBDs and TBFs on strike of Vanga Vanga 12 F4U.\n  At 1000 April 25, 1943 twelve F4Us took off from Guadalcanal to escort 6 SBDs on a bombing mission against the airfield at Vila on Kolombangara Island. Four of the F4Us were to make a strafing attack on the village of Vanga Vanga and barges near by. The rendezvous with SBDs was over Savo Island at 3,000 feet and the planes proceeded North of Russell Islands, over North of Vangunn Island crossing over New Georgia Island to Roviana Lagoon. They continued north westward at and altitude of 17,000 feet until they reached a point over the southern portions of Wana Wana Island. The SBDs could not accomplish their bombing of Vila because of the density of clouds. At this point the strafing flight, consisting of Major Payton, and Lts. Eckart, Vedder, and Peck, broke off from the main flight, dropping down over the Blackett Strait to an altitude of 2,000 feet and made four strafing runs, at about tree tops, on the village near Vanga Vanga, the assigned target, and two runs on a position in a small cove nearby where there, reportedly were some enemy barges and supplies. Both positions were left smoking. Afterwards the flight headed homeward, climbing to 3,000 feet toward Baruku Island. When at a point south of Vangunn Island they noticed a formation of planes high, to their right. The F4Us made a climb behind a very dense cloud and without detection. The enemy was heading on a line with the western portion of the Russell Islands and Tulagi. There were approximately 12 to 16 twin engine monoplanes. These bombers were covered by layers of Zeros. The fight lasted only a few minutes, but the F4Us confronting over whelming odds succeeded in breaking up the raid and turning the enemy back. In addition to repulsing the enemy this flight shot down six Zeros against the loss of two F4Us and one Pilot, Lieutenant Eckart.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
