Last night Dumbo aircraft located a small flotilla of ships heading down the eastern coast of Bougainville, obviously heading to resupply Kahili bomber airbase. Remember to keep and eye on your fuel. Also watch for fighers out of Kara, especialy any earth toned Zekes as these are probably the new group out of Rabual. There are alot of skilled pilots in this new bunch.\n\nWar Diary:\n\nJuly 17, 1943\n\nTwo divisions took off at 0730 to escort TBFs on a bombing strike against shipping in Tonolai Harbor in the Buin-Kahili area. The rendezvous was over Visu Visu Point on New Georgia at 0840. The bombers flew at 11,000 feet, made a wide turn circling the Shortland Island over Bougainville and approached the target from the north. The target consisted of a Cruiser with four DDs circling it and other smaller craft in the harbor. The TBFs made direct hits on the larger craft, which exploded and was definitely destroyed. There were hits on other smaller craft, which were left burning. Four Zeros attacked Lt. F.H. Garison from behind and out of the sun and Garison was last seen diving in flames towards the water. The bombers retired over the Shortlands, at which time, Lt. Shaw, who was at 5,000 feet, saw a float monoplane directly beneath him. He made a very abrupt overhead on the float plane firing into it. Lt. Thomas saw this plane crash into the water, in flames. A TBF called that a Zero was on its tail so Morgan dove down on the Zero, shooting it. The Zero burst into flames and dove down into the water. Morgan got all three of those Zeros in about a minute and a half. Gunner Hodde, who was flying wing on Lt. Brown, shot a Zero off of Browns tail, which crashed into the water smoking. Hodde made another run on a Zero, causing it to burst into flames and go down, after which he became separated from the formation. Hodde got into quite a dog fight with a number of Zeros, succeeded in following one into a loop and at the top of the loop, practically blew the cockpit out of the Zero. It peeled off and fluttered down in flames. Hoddes plane received many bullet holes, a 20mm came into his cockpit and hit him in the calf of his leg. However he was able to get to Segi where he landed safely.\n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
