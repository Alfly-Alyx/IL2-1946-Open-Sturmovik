All operational F4U-1 aircraft of VMF-213 will participate in todays missions. Divisions I, and III from Fighter One, and divisions II, IV, and V from Cactus are to rendezvous over Cape Esperance at six thousand feet and take up a heading for Blanche Channel, and Rendova. At 0635 the 9th Defense Battalion landed on Kokorana Island, and Rendova south of the Renard Channel entrance. Here it has begun to move immediately into position to provide AAA defense, and to set batteries and begin firing 155mm guns on the Munda area. All flights are instructed to strike any enemy positions on Rendova south of the landing zones, and to keep the skies clear. Note that divisions I, and III are instructed to loiter over Rendova as supporting waves of XIV Corp land. Divisions I and III are also instructed to land at Knucklehead Fighter Strip I (southern strip) where they will operate for the rest of this tour. (Northern Knucklehead Strip still under construction.)\n\nWar Diary:\n\nJune 30, 1943\n\nMajor Weissenberger, Lts. Thomas, DeFabio, and Garison, along with Capt. Cloake, Lts. McCleary and Boag were kept on scramble alert, standing by their planes until 1355 when they were scrambled and ordered to proceed to Rendova. They arrived over Rendova at 1445, flying at 26,000 feet. After circling the area there was a Tally Ho and the fight was on. DeFabio dropped to 3,000 feet where he saw two Zeros and fired upon one causing it to smoke, burst into flames and dive into the water below. Major Weissenberger, Lts. Thomas, and Garison attacked a group of Zeros, and the Major shot down three of them before being shot down himself. He was able to get out and his parachute opened just before he hit the water. Luckily he landed near a U.S. Destroyer that picked him up and returned him to Guadalcanal. During the fray Thomas succeeded in shooting down four zeros, which were confirmed, and one probable, before returning to base and pancaking at 1725. Lt. Garison succeeded in shooting down two Zeros in flames. His plane was hit, just to the rear of the cockpit, which filled with smoke. He thought he was going to have to bail out, but the smoke cleared away and he joined Lt. DeFabio and returned to base.  \n\n\n____________________\nAcft: F4U-1 Corsair.\nSkin: 22.bmp, No Markings.\n
