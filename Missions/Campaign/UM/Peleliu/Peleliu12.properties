Name Hit Bloody Nose Ridge
Short \n
Description MAB Peleliu, September 30th 1944\n\nD+15\n\nWeather: Cloudy with no wind.  Visibility: Clear\n\nThe remaining Japanese have been squeezed into two pockets; one in the north, and one in the Umurbrogol Mountains, the highest point of the island.  Seems like almost every ridge and crevasse has gained a nickname; "Walt's Ridge", "Five Sisters", "Old Baldy"; but those homely titles don't reflect the bloody fighting that has been waged to gain their possession.\n\nNo, the name that really sums up the whole morass is the name the Marines have given the range itself - "Bloody Nose Ridge"\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRight on boys, we got a familiar mission for you - hit Bloody Nose Ridge.  But this time there's a twist: we're doing it at night.\n\nThe Japs like to shake us up when the sun goes down, so it's about time we returned the favor.  Arty have marked the target with phospherus.  Hit that target hard with your 1000 lb bombs, then get back down and sleep the sleep of the Just.\n
