Description USS Lexington, September 15th 1944\n\nD-Day, H+11\n\nWeather: Medium cloud with gusty winds from North.  Visibility: Poor\n\nIt's been so long since I've smelt fresh air.  All I get to smell round here is grease, av-gas and tire rubber.  \n\nAll I've heard the whole of the day is wheels hitting the deck.  Everyone's tired, even the gunners.  They've not had anything to do, but it gets to them anyway.  They're always twitchy, even when there's no enemy around.  Especially when there's no enemy around.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nIt's been one heck of a day, and I know you men are exhausted.  We've got one last task for you before you turn in.\n\nWe've had reports of enemy recon planes coming in from Babelthuap.  I want a pair of you to get up there, take a look around.  If you see anything sniffing around, I want you to chase it off.   Get over the island and get up high.\n\nIf they head back to base, don't follow them too far.  We've got another busy day tomorrow, and I want you both back in one piece.\n
