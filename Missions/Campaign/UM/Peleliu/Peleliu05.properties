Name Attack on Asias village
Short \n
Description USS Lexington, September 16th 1944\n\nD+1\n\nWeather: Cloudy with moderate winds from Northwest.  Visibility: Hazy\n\nWe've heard that the heat on the island has hit 100F and rising.\n\nAs if it wasn't difficult enough for those guys.  Colonel Puller's 1st Regt. has taken one heck of a pounding.  They've seized Hill 200, but at the cost of over two hundred casualties.  They also took the east ridge, but with the loss of another two hundred and fifty men.  They're probably gonna be a thousand down by the end of the day.\n\nThings are looking better in the centre, at least as far as combat is concerned.  Badly enough, they've lost hundreds of marines from drinking petroleum-contaminated water.  Looks like someone forgot to scrub the drums.\n\nSeems to me the main problem is getting firepower into position.  The reef is so wide, men have to drag everything through the water before it can be loaded onto the beach.  Good job we got those pack howitzers.  They sure do come in handy.  As do the waterproofed M4's.  They can take over the armor job from the Amtracks.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\n3/5 Marines have requested an air strike on Asias.  They need this position neutralised in order to gain control of the airfield.  Get in and cover the target with HE.  We've been warned that the enemy has strong firepower reserves in this location so keep your speed high and utilise any cover you can on the approach to, and egress from, the target.\n\nTBF's from Wasp will be striking positions on the Ngarmoked Peninsula on the Southern tip of the island.  We've had very little contact with enemy air elements so far, so at least that should be one factor you're able to discount.\n
