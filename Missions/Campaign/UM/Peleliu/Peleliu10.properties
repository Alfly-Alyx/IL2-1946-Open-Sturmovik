Name Night over Ngesebus
Short \n
Description MAB Peleliu, September 28th 1944\n\nD+13\n\nWeather: Cloudy with light winds.  Visibility: Hazy\n\nNight-time on Peleliu, and still you don't feel safe.  The Japanese are experts in infiltration.  That comes from spending so long on this island.  Mostly they get behind our lines, and start shooting things up.  It doesn't do much material damage but it sure shreads our soldiers' nerves.\n\nSometimes the Japs don't shoot at all.  They get in silently and cut somebody's throat.  Could be you, could be the guy sleeping next to you.  Then they disappear.\n\nI heard they even got into General Smith's headquarters on D-Day, but we don't expect a hurried confirmation on that one.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nThe Amphibious assault on Ngesebus begins tomorrow.  3/5 will be leading the assault in place of 1st Regiment.  General Geiger has pulled them out of the line, and replaced them with 321 RCT.  Looks like Rupurtus won't get his Marine-only operation after all.\n\nI'm sure I'm not alone when I speak of my admiration for the 1st.  They've fought so damn hard through this campaign, it's sad to see them go like this.\n\nHowever, that's not your concern.  We want you to pay a little nocturnal visit to Ngesebus, and bust up their defences.  Keep your eyes peeled though, we've heard of enemy night-fighters operating out of Koror.\n\n
