Description MAB Peleliu, October 8th 1944\n\nD+27\n\nWeather: Calm.  Visibility: Clear\n\nGeneral Geiger has declared the assault phase over, and ordered the Marines to start preparing to ship out.  The 81st Division has been given the job of mopping up, though everyone knows there's plenty of Japanese left up on the ridges.  They'll probably still be pulling them out next year.\n\nWe're ready to stay on the island.  We've just started to see the first  marines coming back from the forward areas for embarkation.  They sit around in silence most of the time, their expressions impenetrable.  It's hard to imagine what most of them have gone through.  They say the worst thing about surviving combat is the period of reflection afterwards.  I think these guys still have a lot to get through.\n\nAnyway, I'm off flying today.  Think I'll just sit around and look at the sky.  I guess I need time to think for a while myself.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nVMF-121 and VMF-122 have been assigned to operate from Peleliu to give full air coverage of this sector of the Pacific.  Nimitz is determined to take whatever advantage can be leveraged from this operation.  \n\nThe way is clear now for the assault on the Phillipines, and Operation Stalemate has given us the ability to watch our backs, however debatable the cost in human lives.  It's no secret that we underestimated the ability of the Japanese to build and maintain defenses, and it looks like this war in the Pacific is only going to get tougher.  God only knows what awaits us.\n\nYou, however, won't be staying on.  Your service here on the island has been exemplary, and you've been recommended for a tour of the forward areas.  You'll take your plane with you and give instruction to freshly qualified pilots, as well as giving recognition lessons to various ground and naval personnel.  After that's over, you will await re-assignment.\n\nA CVE is waiting to pick you up off shore.  It's sure been good to know you, and may God go with you wherever you go.\n
