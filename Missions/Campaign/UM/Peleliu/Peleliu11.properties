Name Assault on Ngesebus
Short \n
Description MAB Peleliu, September 28th 1944\n\nD+13\n\nWeather: Cloudy with light winds.  Visibility: Poor\n\nThe conditions on Peleliu rarely deviate from unbearable.  The temperature has hardly dipped below 100 since D-Day, and on some occasions  reached 115.  The coral that makes up most of the island soaks up the heat during the day and keeps it there through the night, so it's no cooler even then.  Some units have reported as many casualties through heat prostrations as they have from enemy action.\n\nClean water is always a problem.  The water on the island is OK, as long as you lace it with sufficient halizone.  If you can't get that you have to play Russian roulette with the stuff in the scoured drums that comes in from the ships.\n\nAnd there sure are some unpleasant little insects out here.  Worst are the blowflies.  They live on waste food and rotting corpses.  Needless to say we're always doing our best to keep the little bastards fed.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nOK boys, the attack on Ngesebus is under way.  We anticipate this attack will isolate the Japanese forces in the north into an isolated pocket.\n\nYour bird is all bombed up and ready to go.  You might just have to wait for 321 RCT to get the last of their support equipment across the airfield.  There's a couple of guys from VMF-122 behind you who will accompany you on this mission.  Show them what life on Peleliu is all about.\n\nAttack the enemy shore installations, and any other defensive positions you can identify.\n\nOnce you've completed this assignment, we want you to cover those incoming F6F night fighters we've been expecting from Wasp.  Be sure to give them a warm Peleliu welcome, before the Japs give them one they won't forget.\n\n
