Name Strike Koror
Short \n
Description MAB Peleliu, October 10th 1944\n\nD+25\n\nWeather: Mild Haze  Visibility: Good\n\nDue to the campaign dragging on as long as it has, it's almost been forgotten what we're here for, which is to project Marine Aviation across this region of the Pacific.  VMF-114 and VMF-122 have already been conducting long-range patrols, and they've also been striking the enemy-held islands of Koror and Babelthuap.\n\nThey don't like these latter missions.  The targets are hard to find, and the flak is usually intense.  There's nearly always losses.  We've got our first pass over that area today, so we'll get to see what the rest of the Palaus look like.  Probably just more stinking jungle full of nasty emperor-lovers\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nI've got good news for those of you who hate Peleliu - and that's probably all of you.  You're going north this morning to strike Koror.  Your target is the seaplane base at Akarebesan.  Intelligence estimates there are still at least 30,000 Jap soldiers barracked on the remaining Palauan Islands, so let's keep reminding them there's a war on, and degrade what assets they still have.\n\nWe don't want them to even think about visiting us any time soon, so a visual demonstration of the damage we can inflict should help dissuade them from such action.\n
