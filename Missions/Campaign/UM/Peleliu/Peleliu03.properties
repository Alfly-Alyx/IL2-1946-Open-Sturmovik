Name Suppress the Japanese Counter Attack
Short \n
Description USS Lexington, September 15th 1944\n\nD-Day, H+9\n\nWeather: Medium cloud with gusty winds from North.  Visibility: Poor\n\nWe've been over the island all day.  The shore is a waste of burning amtracks.  From what we hear back here, it looks like our maps are inaccurate and our bombardment has been ineffective.  The Japanese are dug into caves in the huge coral outcrops that overlook the reef.  The Marines have been waiting for the big Banzai charge, but so far the enemy is playing it cagey.\n\n5th Regiment is making good progress in its task of pushing up through the airfield.  1st Regiment on the left and 7th on the right are experiencing stiff resistance.  We're dropping behind schedule already, and we've yet to make any contact with major enemy formations.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nGentlemen, we've been waiting all day for the enemy to counter-attack, and at long last it looks like he's getting something together.  5th Regiment forward observation have reported enemy armor amassing at the village of Asias at the far end of the airfield.  We're not sure what to expect, but knowing the Japs it's sure to be spectacular.\n\nWe're arming you with AP rockets to take out any armor that tries to invest our positions.  The situation is still precarious on the flanks, so we need to neuter any attempt the enemy may make to turn our flanks and prise us off the beach.\n\nTake out the armor, and nullify his offensive.  Keep a watchful eye over the beach.  We don't want to lose any assets to enemy air inderdiction.\n\nGod speed.\n
