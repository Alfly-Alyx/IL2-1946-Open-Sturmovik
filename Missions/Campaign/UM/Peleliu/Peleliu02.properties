Description USS Lexington, September 15th 1944\n\nD-Day, H-1\n\nWeather: Medium cloud with light winds from Southwest.  Visibility: Poor\n\nGeneral Rupurtus' 1st Marine Division are loaded onto the boats and heading to shore.  They've just spent 4 months kicking their heels on Pavuvu.  That was one hell of a place - no food, no beer, no amenities, just the smell of rotting coconut plantations.  \n\nIt was supposed to be R&R, but they had nothing to do but sit around and get heat stroke, or try and duck the shrapnel from the men grenading the local alligators.  When he got to hear of it, Bob Hope nearly broke his neck to get over there and do a USO, but that only upset the men who were expecting Rita Heyworth.\n\nThere's some pretty frustrated guys out there.  Probably want to take it out on the Japanese.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nOK Men, we want a fast turn around on the deck.  Don't worry about the state of your bird, we got another one all warmed up and ready to go for you.\n\nThe Marine assault is on the beach head directly in front of the airfield.  It's the most valuable strategic asset on the island and we want it straight away.  The assault is split onto two beaches - White beach on the left flank, and Orange beach on the right.\n\nYour job is to protect the men landing on Orange from enflilade fire by clearing any enemy positions in the jungle to the South of their landing zone.  Salvo your rockets as soon as you hit the island.  Don't worry about accuracy, that forest is crawling with enemy.\n\nYou'll see the invasion fleet as you go in.  Get down low and throttle your engines.  The boys sure do find that reassuring.\n\nF4U's from Wasp will be napalming flak positions to the rear of your target, so try not to interfere with their flight.\n\nWhen you've expended your ordnance, get up high and run a CAP over the assault fleet.  Our intelligence is that most of the Japanese air reserves were destroyed on Babelthuap, but we still need to minimise the risk of enemy interdiction.  \n\n
