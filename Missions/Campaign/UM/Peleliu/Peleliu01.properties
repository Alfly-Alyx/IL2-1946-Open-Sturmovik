Name Dawn Strike
Short \n
Description USS Lexington, September 15th 1944\n\nD-Day, H-2\n\nWeather: Medium cloud with light winds from Southwest.  Visibility: Hazy\n\nDawn.  Beautiful Pacific dawn.  The smoke from the island reaches us even out here, and mixes with the cordite from our guns.  What a smell.  I can't even describe it.  The dust gets everywhere.  In our eyes and ears, our bunks, the filters of our engines.....\n\nThe Navy planned a two day barrage.  The Marines wanted three days.  So the Navy have been firing two days worth of ammunition over three days.  Admiral Oldendorf says he's run out of targets and has taken half the fleet on to Leyte.  It's just us now, and the brooding silhouette of this island on the distant horizon.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nAt ease.  The first  mission of today is to support the final shore bombardment.\n\nMost of you men will be unfamiliar with Napalm.  It's a gasoline gel congealed with NApththic and PALMitic acids.  It sticks to everything it touches, and burns everything it sticks to.  It's liquid hell, and the Japs can't get enough of it.\n\nYour job is to hit the rear side of Mt. Kamilianlul.  Recon shows that it's where our bombardment has been least effective.\n\nYou'll be carrying a quarter tank of fuel and drop tanks.  Deliver your ordnance at Waypoint 7, then proceed to Waypoint 9, where you will  drop tanks.  This will render you able to escort the recon PBY back to the fleet.  \n\nThe PBY is there to monitor the bombardment, and will be paying close attention to the effect of your action.\n\nLexington is steaming at her full speed of 33 and 1/4 knots.  You've got a heavy load to get off the deck, so here's how you do it:\n\nExtend wings\nLock tail wheel\nSet flaps to take off position\nSet rudder trim 10 clicks to starboard\nSet elevator trim nose up.\nSet radiator closed\nSet full power + WEP\nRelease chocks\nRetract undercarriage the instant you leave the deck\nWhen you stabilise at the bottom of the drop, retract flaps immediately\n(Power down and open rads when appropriate)\n\nAnd a final warning.  The intense fires that we have created on the island may affect the control of your airplane at low level.  If you get hit DO NOT bail under any circumstances.  The vortices created by these fires will suck you right in.  USS Greenling will be on surface station near Waypoint 5 for the whole of D-Day.  In the event of emergency attempt to ditch in close proximity.\n\nGood luck and may God be with you.\n
