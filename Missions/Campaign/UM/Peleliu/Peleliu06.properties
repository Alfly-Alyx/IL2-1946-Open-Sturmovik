Name The Assault on Angaur
Short \n
Description USS Lexington, September 17th 1944\n\nD+2\n\nWeather: Cloudy with light winds from South.  Visibility: Hazy\n\nWe've had news that the attack on Angaur is going off this morning.  81st "Wildcat" Division has been tasked with the assault.\n\nWord is Rupurtus doesn't want an Army division interfering in Peleliu, especially a green one, so he's given them a sideshow to keep them occupied.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nAs I'm sure you men are aware, the 81st under General Mueller are the reserve Division assigned to this operation.\n\nThey're fresh and eager to go, and as the situation on Peleliu seems to have stabilised, we've decided to let them cut their teeth on Angaur.\n\nThe assault has been split onto two beaches, Red on the Northeast shore, and Blue on the East.  You will be supporting the landings on Blue by softening up the enemy's shoreline positions.\n\nWe've provided you with bombs for this task.  Once they have been expended then you are free to attack any additional targets that make themselves available.\n\nGood luck, men.  And may God be with you.\n
