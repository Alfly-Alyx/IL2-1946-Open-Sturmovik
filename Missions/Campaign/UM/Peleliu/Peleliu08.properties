Name Stop the Japanese Re-supply
Short \n
Description Peleliu, September 23rd 1944\n\nD+8\n\nWeather: Cloudy with no wind.  Visibility: Good\n\nI'm sure you boys are glad to be out of the clutches of the Navy and back with your fellow Marines.  I'd like to welcome you to Peleliu.\n\nI say, I'd like to, but i'm afraid this is probably the worst place on Earth.  It's humid, it's fetid, it's full of crevasses, swamps and burning vegetation.  It's entirely populated by poisonous snakes and angry Japanese.  If they don't get you, then one of our exotic tropical diseases will.\n\nOnly good thing about Peleliu is that it's made me not afraid to die.  That's because on Judgement Day, I can stand in front of Lucifer himself, and I can look him in the eye, and say "Sir, I am not afaid to go to Hell.  Because I've been to Peleliu.  And Peleliu is worse."\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nI'm sorry to have to kick you boys out of bed at this early hour.  I bet you were looking forward to another day of napalming parakeets.  We've just heard the Japanese are trying to resupply the island.  A fleet of troop carriers from Babelthuap has slipped through our Naval blockade.  \n\nThe destroyer H L Edwards is on its way to intercept.  We got SBD's coming in from the fleet.  We got you boys too.  Get over there and stop them barges.  We must deny the enemy any chance of maintaining his position.\n
