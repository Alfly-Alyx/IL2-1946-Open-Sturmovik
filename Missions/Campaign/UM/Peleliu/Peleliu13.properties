Description MAB Peleliu, October 8th 1944\n\nD+23\n\nWeather: Stormy with heavy rain.  Visibility: Blind\n\nWe've been grounded for the last three days, since the typhoon hit the island.  Seems like the enemy has been grounded much longer.\n\nThe campaign seems to be dragging out forever.  The fewer Japs there are left, the longer it takes to track them down and neutralise them.  It seems their cave structures are more well-planned than anything we've experienced before.  The marines capture one tunnel system, think they've won a victory, only to smell Japanese cooking from several levels below.  The Army, for their part, just seal up the entrances with bulldozers.\n\nI guess in some ways the Japs can be content with themselves.  They've honored their code of Bushido with a skill and tenacity no folks who survive here will ever forget.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nRight boys, the storm seems to be blowing over, so we're ready to resume operations.  We want you to look after the R4D's that are inbound on a re-supply.  We're running greviously low on plasma, morphine and field dressings, so we need every one of those birds back here safe.\n\nBefore you get up there, you're gonna hit The Pocket.  Hit the backside of it coming in from the sea.  Good thing about napalm is it keeps on burning no matter what the weather.  Our boys on the ground have been keeping up the pressure on the enemy the last few days, so I figure we owe them one.\n\nWhen you've dispersed your gel, get climbing and rendezvous with the transports.  Make sure you're at 6000ft by the time you reach Waypoint 6.  You can drop your tanks there, and have plenty of juice to get back dry.\n
