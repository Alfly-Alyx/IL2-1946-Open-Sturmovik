Name Redeployment to Peleliu
Short \n
Description USS Lexington, September 20th 1944\n\nD+5\n\nWeather: Cloudy with light winds from South.  Visibility: Hazy\n\nIt's starting to become clear just how strong the Japanese defenses are.  They've been waiting for us for a long time, and they've used that time well.  They've blasted a series of deep and intricate caves in to the hard coral that makes up most of the island.  And the trouble is if you're not in a cave, you're not under cover, as the coral is too hard to dig into.\n\nIt's even worse in the jungles, as the caves are given natural cover.   Flame throwers and grenades are the preferred method to clear the bunkers.  You can trace the frontline by the fires that poke through the tree tops.  Sometimes even they aren't good enough, and the Marines are having to drag out almost every Jap with their bare hands.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nAs the Seabees are busy restoring the airfield to a useable state, you have been selected to be part of the advance party to operate from Peleliu.  \n\nI know many of you are keen to put your feet on dry land again, though some of you may feel that Peleliu is not the ideal place.  It's getting hotter and hotter out there, and the mosquitos are coming out to play.  We're running low on DDT, so remember to take your Quinine.\n\nThe Marines are desperate for Close Air Support, so you're going to be running shifts when the call comes through.  It's gonna be hard work with little chance of glory.  But I know how tough you guys are, and I know you can take it.\n\nWhile you're in transit, take a recon over the North side of the island.  The enemy were building a runway on the small island of Ngesebus, and although that appears to be abandoned, reports are coming through of increased activity in this area.\n\nWe've not seen any enemy air activity for nearly a week, though we've heard of a few nuisance raids in this sector.  If you see anything you don't like, you have full clearance to bring it down.\n
