Name VMF-121 Arrives in Force
Short \n
Description MAB Peleliu, September 26th 1944\n\nD+11\n\nWeather: Cloudy with no wind.  Visibility: Hazy\n\nLast few days we've been doing circuits over the Jap positions in front of the airfield.  We just go up, drop our bombs and touch down again.  Most of us have stopped bothering to raise our undercarriage.  We don't even worry about bullet holes or fuel leaks, we're in the air for such a short time.\n\nWe don't like to spend too much time on the turn-around.  All you see when you land is the casualties being brought back.  Some of the bodies are in such a state they can only be recognised by their fingerprints.  That's when there's a body left to bring back.  I don't envy the guys down here.  Flying has it's hazards, but at least you don't get to see what happens to people.\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nMarine Air Base Peleliu has been declared operational.\n\nThe rest of you boys from VMF-121 will be joining us today from Lexington.  I want you to cover their approach and make sure they get down safely.  Keeping them safe when they've landed is our job.\n\nThere's no point in going to the effort of getting you up there if you're not going to do something useful on the way.  We've got some new 1000lb bombs we'd like you to try out on the Jap emplacement north of the airfield.  \n\nIf you're not gonna bother to raise your undercarriage before you drop your ordnance, make sure to tell your armorer to give it a good long fuse.  Just remember the poor guy behind you.\n\nWhen you do get up there, do a recon over Ngesebus.  Those Army Piper Cubs have arrived in crates, and no-one in this whole damn place knows how to put them together.\n\n
