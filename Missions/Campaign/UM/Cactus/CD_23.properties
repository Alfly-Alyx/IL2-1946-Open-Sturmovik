Short Bomber Intercept...Again\n\n\n\n
Description September 28th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nWe got into another big scrap yesterday with the Japanese bombers. We have found out that if we dive down on the bombers and aim for the wing root, it is fairly safe and easy to flame them in a single pass. Then we zoom back up and check around for the fighter escort. If they are still not jumping on us yet, we will peel off and attack the bombers again.\n\nYesterday we were a little late getting off and the bombers managed to drop a good string right on the SBDs over at the main strip. They took out 5 SBDs & 5 more TBFs as well. Flight 300 from the Enterprise left yesterday and we are all sorry to see them go. Caldwell's crews did a great job keeping the Tokyo Express away from the Island while they were here, so I wish what's left of them good luck.\n\nThe weather is nice again today, so we will try to get an earlier start as the Betty bombers are sure to be coming back for more. This time we will be ready and hit them a little further away from the field than yesterday.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
