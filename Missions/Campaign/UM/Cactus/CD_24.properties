Name Cactus Diary 24
Short Ambush\n\n\n\n
Description October 2nd, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nThere was another air raid 3 days ago, but it was a little different than they usually are. The Bettys turned back before they got to the Island, and the fighters came in by themselves. I guess we beat up the bombers so bad the last few missions that they are just guiding the fighters here to take a crack at shooting us down. The Navy Squadron took them on and said they shot down 4 Zekes but they lost one of their guys as well who was killed when he crashed. Our flight didn't even see them.\n\nAdmiral Nimitz flew in right in the middle of a storm 2 days ago and gave out medals to a bunch of the guys yesterday morning. John Smith, Bob Galer & Marion Carl all got the Navy Cross. The look on Captain Carl's face was priceless when he realized that he had a roll of toilet paper hanging out of his pocket the whole time. The rest of them all got the DFC and then the Admiral left. It was raining so hard, his transport slid off the runway and had to wait for the rain to quit before it could take off.\n\nIt has cleared up again today so we are getting ready for the usual noon raid. Just another routine day here in our own private hell hole.\n\n\n * Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
