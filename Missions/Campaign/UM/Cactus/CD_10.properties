Description August 30th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nWe got more bad news this morning from the Navy boys. The transport that brought our ground crew and supplies yesterday has run aground at Tulagi and they are having a hard time unloading all the rest of our equipment. A flight of Army "Peashooters" has taken off to cover it while we get ready for our mission. We are down to eight Wildcats so the Army guys have volunteered to fly with us and provide some air cover while the Navy tries to finish unloading the ship.\n\nI hope they brought some mail or maybe even a bottle of whiskey with them because this routine is really getting on my nerves. Every day we sit in the sun and wait to take off. Then we fly out to do battle with the Japanese fighters and bombers and kill them or get killed ourselves. If we make it back, the food is crap, there are no showers and we have to sleep in our clothes because "Washing Machine Charlie" is sure to fly over at about 2am and drop a bomb on some poor sucker's head and the rest of us will be running for the bunker quicker than a scalded cat. At least I don't have malaria or dysentery yet like most of the guys. That would really be the worst to fly around for a couple of hours with diaahrea and a fever. I don't know how long I can keep this up, but I will do what I signed up for and that means it's time for another joy ride.\n\nWe will be covering the ship up at Tulagi while they try and finish unloading her. The bombers from Rabaul or wherever they fly in from will probably be back again today since the weather is good and we will try to keep them from wiping out the rest of our supplies. I have to make extra certain they don't blow up that ship until I get my mail!\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
