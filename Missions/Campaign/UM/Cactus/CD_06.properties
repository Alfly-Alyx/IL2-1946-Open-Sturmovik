Name Cactus Diary 6
Short Air Raid Intercept\n\n\n\n
Description August 23rd, 1942, \nDear Diary,\n\nI finally ran into the famous "Zeke" yesterday afternoon and what do you know, I am still here to tell about it. My stomach tightened up into a little knot when I first spotted them coming straight at us, but as soon as we got close all I thought about was flying the plane. Some of our Wildcats got shot up by the Zekes, but it seems pretty easy to get back to base. We just dive away toward the field and they can't keep up so they go away. I guess they don't have too much gas to stick around and chase us after flying all the way here from Rabaul. It is good to know that the Grummans will hold together after getting peppered by those Japanese cannon shells. \n\nNo flying for me today, they cancelled all the CAP flights since we are running low on oxygen bottles. We will only take off when we get word of an inbound air raid. There are a bunch of Australian guys on some of the islands around here and they call on the radio to tell us when the enemy planes pass over their island. This whole invasion was called "Operation Watchtower" when it started, but we have started calling it "Operation Shoestring" because that and a prayer is all it is put together with. There is no such thing as a pre-flight briefing either. We just go by the operations tent to get our plane number and they run up a Japanese rising sun flag at the Pagoda when it is time to take off. We climb like hell for altitude and get a radio vector to the bogies.\n\nI am going for a swim in the river at the end of the runway later and one of the guys still has a half bottle of whiskey stashed in his kit. Maybe I can talk him out of a sip or two.\n\n\nAugust 24th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nI am on watch today so I have a few minutes to write while I wait.\n \nI found out this strip is actually named "Henderson Field". All I had ever heard it called was "Cactus" until now. It is named after the squadron leader from VMF 221 who was the first Marine pilot killed at Midway. I don't think I want an airfield named after me! \n\nA squadron of Navy SBDs flew in yesterday and stayed here to refuel. Boy were those guys surprised when a japanese destroyer shelled the field at 0200, but no one was hurt. They said there is an enemy carrier cruising to the northeast of us that they are looking for so they left a little while ago to resume the search. We are getting ready to take a full squadron patrol out and look for enemy scout planes as well. Captain Carl is leading the mission and he says we will head out over Florida Island and patrol at about 6000 feet and see if we can catch any of the carriers planes heading our way. They are taking a big risk getting in range of our dive bombers, so they must be up to something sneaky. Maybe we can catch them before they get to us!\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n
