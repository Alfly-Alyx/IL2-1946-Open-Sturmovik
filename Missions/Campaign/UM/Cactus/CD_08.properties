Description August 26th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nI am on watch again today so I have a few minutes to write while I sit here by my plane. I heard a little while ago that the coast watchers reported a flight of bombers inbound down "The Slot" from Rabaul. I expect we will be seeing the red alert flag soon and it is another beautiful day to shoot down the enemy. It sure seems strange that an Island like this with such nice beaches and tropical scenery can look so ugly from up there when the shooting starts. Oh well, I better double check my gear now. If I get shot down, it might be a long trip back. Carrying all this stuff out to the revetment is a real challenge with no transportation to speak of around here.\n\nIf another one of the coastwatchers verifies that the enemy formation is on a course for Cactus, we will take off and climb for altitude. Major Smith has been telling us he wants to get above the bombers, roll over and dive down from above to attack. It all sounds great in theory, but I hear those bombers have quite a few machine guns and cannon aimed back at us as well. The plan is to keep our speed up and aim at the wing roots to try and hit a gas tank. If we can flame them on the first pass, we will just dive for the airfield and there is no way the fighter escort can keep up. The Wildcat may not be much of a dogfighter, but it sure can dive like hell!\n\n The overhead run we practiced in training may be harder to pull off than a six o'clock attack, but it should keep us alive to fight again too. We all agree that staying alive is the most important thing right now, because if we start pulling hero maneuvers, there won't be anyone to keep them from taking the field back.\n\nUh,oh ... there goes the flag by the Pagoda... time to go!\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n\n
