Description October 11th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nThe battle is winding down for me on this God forsaken Island, but it is far from over. We have been up a few times in the last couple of days and it is obvious that the Japanese are guarding their forces for a major assault. VMF 121 just flew in with the rest of their squadron to relieve us, and it is none too soon. The Navy has reported a huge amount of activity up towards Rabaul and they have reinforced their dive bomber groups here. The Army has sent in new P-39s to replace the P-400s that were almost all destroyed, and the Navy has flown in more Wildcats and SBDs to bring their Squadrons back up to strength too. The Tokyo Express has been running overtime every night and we all agree that we are in for a rough ride.\n\nJohn Smith and Marion Carl are both being flown out today and that only leaves 4 of us here from Fighting 223. Me and the other guys that can still fly are staying for a little while to try and tell these new pilots as much as we can until they pull us out too. I expect that this will be my last mission... they told us to make sure our stuff is ready to go whenever a transport is available, and with all the traffic through here lately that could be any minute.\n\n We will try to help out 224 as long as they need us, but I have had enough of this to last a lifetime. I don't much care what is coming our way anyhow, because I know the secret to staying alive now. As long as I have enough altitude and keep my speed up, they can't touch me. I have made it through too many close calls and seen too many of my friends go down to let the bastards get me now. Semper Fidelis Mac! \n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
