Short Noon Bomber Intercept\n\n\n\n\n
Description September 5th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nI just got back from strafing the barges and what a slaughter that was! No air cover to bother us and watching the sharks tear into those little guys when they jumped overboard to get away from our .50s was a sight I will never forget. We must have wiped out about 500 of the poor suckers. I guess it's true when they say "War is Hell" .... Oh well, Semper Fi!\n\nThey are fueling and rearming my plane and the rest are ready to go on the noon bomber intercept already. I am still sitting here by the revetment and I haven't even had a chance to get any chow, but I'll be damned if I will miss another opportunity to get at the bombers, food or no food. The quicker we can get rid of the bastards for good, the quicker I can get off this stinking Island and back into the real world. The radar set that was brought in on the transport ship has been set up down near the beach and it is working now. They have spotted a big enemy formation about 120 miles out up the slot so that confirms what the coast watchers have reported. That should put them here in about a half hour so they will be running the flag up at the Pagoda any minute now. I guess I better put my pen away and strap on my gear...it is time to earn my combat pay.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
