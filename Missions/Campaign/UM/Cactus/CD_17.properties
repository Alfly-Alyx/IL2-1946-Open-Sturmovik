Name Cactus Diary 17
Short Washing Machine Charley\n
Description September 11th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nI have had as much as I can take with this damn "Washing Machine Charlie". The lousy plane flys over the field every night dropping flares for the Naval shelling or bombs on our heads, but tonight I am going to give him the surprise of his life! When I told Captain Carl that I was instrument rated and wanted a shot at getting the bastard, he gave me permission to intercept tonight's flight.\n\nThe only catch is that they can't light the runway. Any lights at all would give the bomber a perfect target, so I will have to cruise around and see if they can catch him in the spotlights. With any luck at all, they may be able to give me some kind of light to land by, but I can't count on it. I just have to hope the moonlight is enough to keep me from piling up in the River.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
