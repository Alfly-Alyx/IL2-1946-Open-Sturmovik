Description Cactus Airfield\nAugust 22nd, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nWe landed here at CACTUS yesterday after taking off from the carrier and boy is this place a real hell hole! I thought the ship was bad, but this takes the prize. There's no running water, the latrines are just stinking holes in the ground, the chow is horrible, and there were even Japanese snipers in the treeline taking potshots at us while we were climbing out of our planes. Right now I am laying on my cot in a little pup tent with a swarm of mosquitos and a dead snake I shot with my .45 when the damned thing crawled over my legs while I was asleep.\n\nI was surprised at all the Marines standing around yelling and waving when we landed, but I think I have a better idea why they were so excited after last night. I thought it was some kind of 4th of July celebration, so I went back to sleep. Come to find out about 1000 Japanese made a suicide charge on the lines a half mile from here and they have been blasting away all night keeping them out of the lines. \n\nI already had my breakfast of moldy rice and canned Spam, so it is time to go flying. Four planes just took off on a CAP over the field and my flight is going to strafe the Japanese still attacking at the mouth of the River just down the beach. They are still trying to overrun the beachhead and we are going to give them a little taste of our .50 cals up close and personal. The bunker positions across the river are pretty tough, but we should be able to knock them out and be back for an early lunch. I wonder how that snake would taste grilled?\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC *\n
