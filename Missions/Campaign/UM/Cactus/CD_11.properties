Description September 1st, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nDespite all our efforts, they sank the Calhoun with my mail still on board. The worst part was that 4 of the Army P400s got shot down by Zeros and it was all for nothing. 2 of the missing pilots walked back in today after swimming to shore at Tulagi and catching a ride back across on one of the ships bringing equipment over.\n\nThe good news is that our sister squadron, VMF 224 arrived yesterday afternoon with 19 more Wildcats. They got here just in time, too. We only had 5 planes left to fly after the last mission and the Japanese are not letting up a bit. They have started sending more fighters to escort the bombers, and we need all the help we can get.\n\n\nSeptember 4th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nVMF 224 sure got started off in a bad way. On their first mission a couple of days ago, 3 of their pilots went down without a word. They have been interviewing all the pilots who were on the mission and figure their oxygen masks were leaking. They just pushed over and dove straight in from 18,000 feet. We have been warned to check our fingernails every few minutes when we are above 15,000 feet to see if they are turning blue. If they do, we need to descend and return to the field immediately because it means our oxygen is not working correctly.\n\nLast night, we were surprised to see a transport land with our new CO on board. We took jeeps out to light the runway, and Brigadier General Roy Geiger hopped off as soon as it stopped rolling. He is Commanding General of Marine Air Wing One, so what he says goes and we won't have to wait to get the word on our action plan. He has already decided that we need to attack the Japanese instead of waiting for them to come here, so all day today, every plane we have is going to be making runs up towards Florida Island and Tulagi to strafe the barges that we think are ready to land Japanese troops here. It is about time to get going so I will sign off now.\nI hope I don't get my feet wet today!\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
