Description September 13th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nYesterday while we were on our mission, Rear Admirals McCain and Turner flew in and they were in a meeting with the Marine General Vandegrift all day. They didn't look very happy when they were done, but Admiral McCain came by our field in a jeep to see how things were going. I told him it was rough not getting any sleep for the shelling and bombing, and then being on alert all day with just two meals and running a fever. He promised that they would be sending in reinforcements any day now and just to keep doing the best we can\n\nLast night after a couple of Japanese destroyers shelled the airfield and the Admirals' CP, there was a big firefight along the ridge to the south. That's where Edson's Raiders are dug in and they have been blasting away all night. There is still heavy rifle fire from over there, but we are all ready to go anyway. Hopefully there won't be Japanese soldiers manning the gun emplacements when we get back.\n\nAt 0645, the Admirals both flew out and then 18 brand new F4Fs arrived with ferry pilots flying them off the USS Hornet. That means we have enough planes to launch a full squadron again, but we are dividing them up with 224 to share the fun!\n\nThe radar station has reported a flight of what looks like enemy fighters inbound from the northwest, so as soon as some of our new planes are refueled and armed, we will be taking off to intercept them.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_new *\n\n
