Name Cactus Diary 2
Short Carrier Qualification\n\n\n\n
Description Ewa, Hawaii\nJuly 31st, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nGunnery practice has been going great, I got the best score in the squadron yesterday! Tomorrow is my carrier landing qualification. I am in the last group to qualify, so I guess the pressure is on. We are scheduled to leave port day after tomorrow, so we only have 1 day to finish the car-quals and get all our planes & gear loaded. All I have to do is land on the carrier and take off again without killing myself. The plan is to trap in the first set of wires, and then I can just raise the hook and gun it to take off again. No sweat.\n\nThe ground staff and maintenance guys are going by transport ship and they will be there later...wherever "there" is. The scuttlebut is that we are planning on invading one of the islands in the Solomons chain, but who knows about rumors. I don't even know where this place "Tulagi" is. All I know is that we have brand new fighters and we are going to do what I joined the Marines for. Give some payback to the guys who bombed our base at Pearl Harbor and defend our country.\n\nTime for lights out now so I will dream about a nice smooth landing on the Carrier tomorrow.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_New *\n
