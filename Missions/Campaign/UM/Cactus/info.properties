Description \nCongratulations on your graduation from the Naval Flight Training Academy here in Pensacola. All of you former cadets are now United States Marine Corps Aviators and hold the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. \n\nAs the first graduating class of Marine Officers from this school since the United States declared war on Japan and the Axis Powers, you gentlemen will be the spearhead of our nation. You can expect to be sent to a forward combat zone in the near future, but first you will be going to the Naval Air Station in San Diego for squadron assignment. \n\nYou already have your wings, but be sure you pick up your 2nd Lieutenant's bars on the way out the door. Good Luck!\n\n
