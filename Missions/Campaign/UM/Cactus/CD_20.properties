Description September 13th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nI just have time for a few notes before I take off again. I don't want to forget to write down what happened this morning with all the excitement going on. It looks like the Japanese are right in the middle of a major effort to retake this field. We ran into a fighter sweep this morning and gave them a pretty rough time. Now some of us are going right back up to intercept another raid on it's way down the Slot. This time they say it looks like bombers with a fighter escort, so we will have to be ready for anything.\n\nI am taking one of the old fighters that didn't go up this morning, but it sure was nice to fly a new plane again that didn't have mud all in it. It is pretty bad when you flip over inverted to dive on the bombers or get away from a Zero and a pile of dried mud falls right in your face. I will sure never forget to put my goggles on again. I almost forgot how a new Grummand runs with good spark plugs and a proper tune-up.\n\nEnough for now, time to get going.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
