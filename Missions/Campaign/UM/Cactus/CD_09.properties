Name Cactus Diary 9
Short Bomber Intercept\n\n\n\n
Description August 29th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nIt has been quiet for a few days since the big Carrier battle on the 24th, so we have had a chance to rest up a little. I hear through the grapevine that the Enterprise took a few bomb hits, but the Navy boys sunk a Japanese carrier and a couple of Destroyers. They said it was probably another attempt to overrun us here and none of the ships got through. Maybe we are safe for a little while longer.\n\nA Navy transport has arrived just off Lunga Point so I would guess that our ground crew has finally arrived. They are just in time too. All the Navy CUB guys can do is gas & oil our planes, but they are in need of some serious work at this point. They are all running pretty rough and we need every Wildcat we can get to keep those bombers from getting a clear shot at the field.\n\nI am going up with the intercept flight again today so no more lounging around. We need to make sure the Japanese don't get a chance to do any damage to the cargo ship because we need every bit of what they brought. The CO is sure the Japanese know it is here and we can expect them to try and take it out before it is unloaded. That means we will wait until the coastwatchers call in and we will take off to intercept them. Maybe I can get another one today. A few of our guys are aces already and I wouldn't mind getting a couple more notches on the handle of my .45 either.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n\n
