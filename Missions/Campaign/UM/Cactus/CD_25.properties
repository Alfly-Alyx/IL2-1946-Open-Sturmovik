Description October 3rd, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nWe really got the shit end of the stick yesterday. Red Kendrick and Bill Lees both got shot down and killed. They have been with us since the beginning and both of them just got medals from Admiral Nimitz the day before. Major Smith got shot down too, but he walked back in without any problem and 224 had another 3 pilots shot down as well, including their skipper. It was a raw deal because the radar spotted the fighters too late for us to climb up to their altitude and they got the jump on us.\n\nWe walked out to where Red's plane crash landed in the afternoon and found him dead in the cockpit, so we wrapped him in his raft and buried him right there by the wreck. That only leaves 9 of us out of 18 so I guess my chances of getting off this Island are slimmer every day. I gaurantee there will be Hell to pay if I run into those bastards again today! The bombers are too scared to fly all the way down here now so we will just have to fight the Zekes. I hear there is another raid on the way here just like yesterday, but we won't get caught with our pants down this time.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
