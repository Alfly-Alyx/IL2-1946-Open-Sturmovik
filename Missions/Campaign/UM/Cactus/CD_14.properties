Description September 9th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nMy dysentery has gotten worse and now I have a fever and chills like the rest of the guys. I guess the damn bugs finally got to me too. Even the best of us aren't immune to the pestilence in this rotting hell hole. The Doc came around and took a look at me and the other guys this morning and gave us some pills to take, but it didn't help much. I still feel like I am a little more dead than alive. Doc went and talked to Colonel Woods, but when he said we weren't fit to fly, the Colonel told him "They have got to keep flying... It's better than getting a Japanese bayonette stuck in their ass!" Oh well, I didn't want to be grounded anyway. I just wish I felt a little better. Maybe a cup of hot coffee will help me out a little.\n\nThe weather was pretty crappy the last few days so no flying for us. It didn't stop the Army guys though. I got to hand it to them, they flew about 10 missions each in the rain to provide air cover for Edson's Raiders at Taivu Point along with a few of our SBDs. The Marines got in a big firefight and needed some cover while they pulled out. Those Peashooter pilots did a real swell job of giving it to them even though one of them slid off the runway and busted up his plane. Now they only have 2 left.\n\nIt is about time to get ready for the noon air raid alert even if I don't feel like it. Since the bad weather cleared up we can expect the Japanese to stick to their schedule and come back to hit us again. 8 of our planes will be going up along with another 8 from MF 224 and I am one of the lucky ones. I am sure we will climb to about 15000 feet and run up the slot to meet them like usual. I have about had it with those little guys in the Zeros so they had best watch out today!\n\nThis will be our last flight out from this strip as well. We will be landing at the "Cow Pasture" when we come back, so I have my kit packed and ready to go. It can't be much worse than staying in Mosquito Gulch, so I suppose it is a good thing to move to the new fighter strip. At least we won't be sleeping right in the center of the bullseye any more.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
