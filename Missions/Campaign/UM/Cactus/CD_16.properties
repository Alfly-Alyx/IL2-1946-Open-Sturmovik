Short Will It Ever End?\n\n\n\n
Description September 11th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nNot much to say today. Major Smith led the group yesterday, but Zennith Pond got shot down. He was a great guy too. We have been flying together ever since flight school, at Ewa field in Hawaii, and we shared a tent here at Cactus. It sure won't be the same around camp, but there isn't much I can do about it. No one actually saw him get out of his plane, but we didn't see him crash either. I will wait a while before I pack his stuff ... I am not letting the other guys get at it either. You never know when someone might surprise you and show up again.\n\nMajor Smith says it looks like the Japanese are planning to assault the airfield tonight or tomorrow, so Edson's Marines have moved over to the ridge south of the landing strip and they are digging in there now. I had a fever last night and I really feel like hell, but I guess it is a little better now. I can at least stand up and walk without getting too dizzy and having to sit down again. Besides, we are so short on pilots that I have to fly anyway. I hope I can make it through the mission today because we are going up again to intercept the bombers. The radar reports a new raid coming down the Slot and they will probably try to give us a good pounding. No matter how tough it is to go up, I know that we are the only thing standing in the way of the Japanese wiping out all 14,000 Marines here on Guadalcanal.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
