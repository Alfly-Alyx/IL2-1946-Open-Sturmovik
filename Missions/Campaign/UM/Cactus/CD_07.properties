Description August 25th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nWe really got into the thick of it yesterday. I was so worn out when I got back, I went right to sleep in my tent and slept the rest of the afternoon. We ran into a big air raid from the Japanese Carrier up towards Malaita and Captain Carl, our XO, shot down 3 planes which makes him an Ace! The rest of us shot the hell out of the other "Kates" but three of our guys are missing. They never came back after running into a bunch of "Hamps" that were escorting the bombers. That means we only have 12 fighters to fly now since they fixed the one with the shot up oil cooler.\n\nIt is 5:00 am right now and I am up early because this morning we will be escorting the SBDs on a search mission for a group of enemy transports and Destroyers that are in the area. I didn't get any sleep to speak of anyway since they have been shelling the camp half the night and every time we hear incoming rounds, it is time to dive for the bunker. The dive bombers went out looking for them twice, but they are not sure if they hit anything in the dark.\n\nWe will not be able to stay with the bombers for very long since we don't have any drop tanks, but we will go as far as Malaita and do what we can to give them a little company.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
