Short They're Back...the break is over\n\n\n\n
Description September 14th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nLast night the Japanese tried again to take the airfield. Almost as soon as I landed after fighting the float Zeros, the gunfire started and the Marines on "Bloody Ridge" fought all night long. 300 of them held off about 2000 Japanese troops and wound up falling back to less than  1,000 yards from the edge of the strip. We weathered another storm, but I am sure it will not be the last one.\n\nThen this afternoon, who do you think walked back in but Marion Carl! After he got shot down almost a week ago, he stayed with some friendly natives and they brought him back in their boat. He has 12 victories now and told General Geiger that they need to ground Major Smith for a week so he can catch up to Smitty's 16! He sure has some nerve, but it is good to have him back.\n\n\nSeptember 27th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nIt has been very quiet around here since the rain started a week ago. The weather has been crummy, but that didn't stop the 7th Marine Regiment from arriving to reinforce the 1st Division. That is another 3,500 men to help hold CACTUS.\n\nThe weather cleared up this morning and we are ready for some action. The coastwatcher up at New Georgia has just reported a group of bombers with a fighter escort passing over his island on their way here. We will be taking up 2 flights along with 2 more from 224 to go after the bombers and the Navy Squadron will try to head off the fighters. That should give us a clear shot at them before they reach the field if all goes according to plan. Time to go now... the break is over.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
