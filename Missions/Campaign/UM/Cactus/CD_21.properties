Name Cactus Diary 21
Short Alert Duty\n\n\n\n
Description September 13th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nIt's been a long day already, and now I have to sit on alert duty until dark. I am just waiting here in the cockpit of my Wildcat, writing a few notes to keep myself awake.\n\nWe had a rough mission this afternoon, and a few of the guys didn't make it back. We ran into a bunch of Zekes over Taivu Point and got into one hell of a dogfight. It was just like the old comic book stories I read when I was a kid. One minute there were planes shooting and burning everywhere, and the next, the sky was empty. I am sure I got a couple myself, so that means I did OK too.\n\nThere are supposed to be a couple of SBDs due back in, but I don't expect much out of that. I am supposed to take off just before dark and make a trip around the field to give the dive bombers some air cover. That's a pretty lame excuse for making me sit here and get bit by mosquitos if you ask me, not to mention what a great target I am for the sniper who is probably aiming at me right this very minute.\n\nAll in a day's work at Cactus I suppose. Time to put the diary away now and make one last trip around the field to make sure everyone is safe and sound. As long as the trigger happy AA gunners don't shoot at me, everything should be A-OK.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC *\n\n
