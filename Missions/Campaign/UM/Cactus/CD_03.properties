Name Cactus Diary 3
Short Deployment aboard the USS Long Island\n\n\n\n
Description Somewhere in the Pacific\nAugust 20th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nWe have been at sea since August 2nd and it is just as bad as I thought it would be. After we loaded on the USS Long Island and sailed west, we crossed the equator and all of us "Pollywogs" got the royal treatment. I got herded out of my quarters in my underwear and put through all kinds of hell on the flight deck by the other officers and men who had sailed across the equator before. Now I am an official "Shellback" and next time, I will be the one dishing it out!\n\nWe stopped at an Island called Suva and some of the more junior guys were traded to VMF 212 at Efate for 12 of their guys who have a little more flight time including a new XO, Captain Marion Carl. They must really be worried about this "special mission" because they are throwing everything but the kitchen sink at us. The best guys they can find, new fighters and now replacing some of the others just because a guy has 50 more flight hours than they do. Oh well, it's not my problem to figure it out. Semper Fi.\n\nAt least I have a good idea of where we are going now. We got word at Suva that 1 Australian and 4 American Heavy Cruisers were sunk by the Japanese Navy just off Tulagi while they were supporting the 1st Marine Division. The Marines have taken over an airfield on an Island called Guadalcanal and the Navy guys pulled out and just left them there with no back up at all! According to the crummy charts we have, it is across a wide channel from where we thought we were going.\n\nWe have been ordered to gather our kits and stuff them in the radio compartment of our Wildcats because we are about to take off from the Carrier and land at "CACTUS". That is the code name for the airfield the Marines have captured and we are going to protect. That's all for now, time to pack.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC *\n
