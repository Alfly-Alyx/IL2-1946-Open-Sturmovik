Short Landing Barge Intercept\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description September 5th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nWe really shot up the Japanese barges and their little bivouac yesterday. I got up early to make a few notes in my journal and then I will be going out with the first flight to look for any landing craft we missed yesterday. The word from the Pagoda is that they are still cruising across "Iron Bottom Sound" on their way here. If we can catch them in the open and make a few strafing runs, it will be that many less troops with bayonettes to worry about later.\n\nRear Admiral McCain was here for a few days and went around talking with all us pilots that have been here for a while. He asked alot of questions about our dogfights with the Zeros and our tactics for bouncing the Bettys and he really seemed interested in the answers. He promised to do everything he could to get us more planes and a full squadron of the new P38 Lightnings for the Army guys if he could. I sure hope the reinforcements arrive soon because I am about the only one left from our original crew who doesn't have Malaria. I have had a few mild attacks of dysentery, but nothing that will kill me yet.\n\nThe game plan for today is for the SBDs and the Army Peashooters to take off first and try to locate the Japanese landing barges. Then a flight of our Wildcats will follow and strafe whatever is left. The main priority is to knock out as many landing craft as possible and I for one can't wait to send a few to the bottom with our Destroyers that are already there!\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
