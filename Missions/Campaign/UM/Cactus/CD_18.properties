Short The Cavalry Arrives\n\n\n\n
Description September 12th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nThere is good news and bad news to report today. The bad news is that when we got back from the mission yesterday, we found out that the Bettys had dropped their bombs right on the Army CP and their boss, Dale Brannon got hurt along with a couple of his pilots. He was flown out this morning and probably won't be back. Dale was a real swell guy so that is a tough break for the Peashooter pilots. Bob Galer from Fighting 224 got shot down during the intercept, but he ditched off the beach and swam back to shore. That just goes to show that our plan for attacking the enemy bombers close to the field is a compromise. It is easier for us to get back if we get shot up, but they are more likely to score hits when they drop their loads.\n\nThe good news is that the Navy showed up yesterday afternoon with a full squadron of Wildcats. Their CO is a Lt. Commander named Roy Simpler and they have been fighting the Japanese Navy out here from their carrier since before we even got here. A Japanese sub hit the Saratoga with a torpedo, so they have decided to base VF-5 here to help us. Our Cactus Air Force sure is a mixed up bunch with Army, Marines and Navy all flying together.\n\nToday they are going to get their fist taste of our little war because we will be taking off soon to intercept another air raid headed in towards the Island. We had a red alert this morning and all took off, but it turned out to be a false alarm so we came right back. The ground crews are topping off the gas tanks now and there is a big group of bombers heading our way at high altitude. We will launch every aircraft available to intercept them and then we will see if these Navy boys are as hot as they think they are.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC *\n\n
