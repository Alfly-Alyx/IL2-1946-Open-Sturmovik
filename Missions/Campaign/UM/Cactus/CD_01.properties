Description Ewa, Hawaii\nJuly 25th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nI have never been much of a writer, but maybe now is a good time to start. Something big is about to happen but I am not sure exactly what. This diary will be a good way to remember everything after it is all over, and if I don't make it through, at least someone will know what happened.\n\nAfter I graduated Naval flight School, I was transferred to San Diego and assigned to Marine Air Group 23 which was formed on May 1st, 1942. I am in Marine Fighting 223 and or sister squadron is Marine Fighting 224.\n\nWe moved from there to the Marine Air Station here at Ewa, Hawaii and started advanced squadron training. In early July, we were given a "special mission" and it seems like everything went into high gear overnight. 20 new F4F-4 Wildcat fighters replaced the old Brewster F2A Buffalos that we had used for pursuit training up until then. About that time, a couple of guys from VMF 221 were transferred in after 48 hours leave in Honolulu. They are the ones who survived the Midway Island battle and a couple of them don't seem normal anymore. When I try to talk to them and ask questions, they just seem to look right through me instead of at me.\n\nOur Commanding Officer is Major John L. Smith. He has been drilling us non stop on gunnery practice, so I guess we are going somewhere we will be needing it. I am sure there will be more of the same this afternoon. We have a gunnery range set up where we practice strafing wooden airplanes on the ground and you have to get at least 50 hits on one to get a passing score.\n\nThat's all for now, it is time for chow & then an afternoon practice mission.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_New *\n
