Description Cactus Airfield\nAugust 22nd, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nI only have time for a few quick notes... I have another hop this afternoon. The strafing mission went fine, but what a mess. There were bodies stacked like cordwood in front of the bunkers by the river and there must have been an entire Japanese regiment mowed down out there last night.\n\nThe dive-bomber group has set up a routine search flight every morning and evening to watch for enemy ships heading our way, and we are keeping a flight in the air to intercept any inbound enemy aircraft. We are going up on a Combat Air Patrol to cover the airfield as soon as our planes are refueled and rearmed. A bunch of sailors from CUB-1 are filling in for our ground crew that has not arrived here yet, and they have to hand pump the fuel from 55 gallon drums and manhandle the bombs onto the SBDs. They seem like an eager bunch of guys, even if they don't know a tailhook from a teapot.\n\nMajor Smith says that we will probably start seeing the enemy in the air soon because they have to know we landed here by now. The word is ... make one pass at the fighters and dive for home. We are not allowed to get in any dogfights because the Zeros can turn on a dime and outclimb us to boot. Suites me just fine, I'm not convinced our tubby little Wildcats can knock out the Zeros anyway. \n\nThat's all for now, I have to run over to the Ops tent and get my plane number since we don't have our own planes assigned any more. Then we will be taking off at 1200 for a patrol up towards Savo Island.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC *\n\n
