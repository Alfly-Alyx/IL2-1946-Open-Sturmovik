Description September 10th, 1942\nDear Diary,\n\nNothing much to say today except more bad news. I was too tired to write after I landed, but at least I got some rest during the afternoon. We really got into it again with the Japanese bombers yesterday and we lost more planes. Even worse, Captain Carl was shot down along with 3 other guys from 224. One of them stalled on take off too and his plane is a total write off. Captain Carl was a great guy to fly with. He already had 12 victories and I am sure going to miss him up there. It was always good to know you were following a steady hand who could give out more than he got!\n\nWe only have 13 fighters left, but maybe they will be a little safer here at the new fighter strip. It is mostly mud and we don't have any of the pierced steel planking on the runway, but from the looks of the bombers' run yesterday, I don't think they have any idea that we are even here. I got a ride back to Mosquito Gulch to get my tent in a jeep and what a scare that turned out to be. We took a wrong turn on the way back and wound up lost and out of gas. Those trails through the jungle all look the same and the brush is so thick, you can't even tell what direction you are going. All I had was my .45 and the other guys had a carbine and a couple of grenades. We had to walk about 2 miles back up the trail and I was sure we were going to run smack into a Japanese patrol at any minute! I would rather face a whole swarm of Zekes than walk around in that damn jungle again.\n\nI heard the Army Peashooters and the SBDs take off a while ago, so I guess I better get ready for another trip into the wild blue yonder. I never did get my tent back, so I will just stash this diary in with Captain Carl's stuff until I get back. No one will mess with his things for at least a couple of days. Who knows, he may even show back up again.\n\n\n* Select aircraft skin F4F4_USMC_Dirty *\n\n
