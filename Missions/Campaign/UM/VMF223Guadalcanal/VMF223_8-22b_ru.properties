Description August-24\nTime 1400\nWeather Clear\nCloud Hight ---\nEstimated flight time: 35 minutes\n\tFour days here and still we are short on the essentials, but there is plenty of things to show we arn't alone out here. The 67th Fighter squadron of the USAAF arrived on August 22nd not long after we returned from the aborted strike on the IJN ships.\n\tThat night we also had some unnexpected company from an attack group from the Saratoga, which landed at Henderson after dark, with their 31 SBD's and 7 TBF's. They tell us they were to attack the same convoy as us, and were forced to turn back in the same manner as us. \n\n\t\tThey were shocked at having to refeul their planes by hand, it seems that they don't generally have to do that in the Navy. The Marines had a good laugh but were kind enough to give them a sufficient amount of coffee to last them through the night until the task was done. They were kept awake more by the breif shelling we received around 2330 than from our brew though. The marines at the feild also noted that they ate their emergancy rations from their survival kit rather than eat our food. Early this morning our guests left us to return home to their carrier.\n\n\tRadio reports indicate a lot of Navy action in the area, and most people beleive that means they are finally back to drive off the Jap fleet. Its also probable that we marines will soon be replaced by Army troops, but no one agrees when it will happen.\n\tToday Radar detected a carrier strike force headed for us coming from the north. We arn't sure what's coming next, but for now, we need to get airborne. We are unsure of the altitude they will be coming in at, so take position at 15,000ft and keep an eye out at all altitudes\n\tGood luck to us all.\n
