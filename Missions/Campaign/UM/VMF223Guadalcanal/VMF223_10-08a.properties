Description October 8\nTime 1520\nWeather Rain\nCloud hight 4500ft\nEstimated flight time: 2 hours\n\t\n\tLast night fighting was heard beyond the perimiter, more than a patrol contact. Again the rumors are flying of a Inevitable attack on the airfeilds. On the positive side we also received eleven P39 aerocobras, two Avengers and two Ducks.\n\n\tA Tokyo Express run has been sighted coming down the slot and it's come to us to help the bomber pilots stop it. We will be escorting seven Dauntless dive bombers and four Avengers to the target and back. It is unsure whether or not we will encounter bandits, but keep both eyes open.\n
