Description August-21\nWeather-Good\nClouds-3000ft\ntime-0945\n\n   All last night we were kept awake by every sort of gun imagineable. If every night is like this I don't forsee us getting much sleep. The word is they mounted an effort to retake the airfeild last night and were repelled after heavy fighting. This morning the marines staged a flanking maneuver and have forced them into a triangular pocket.\n\n   Takeoff and destroy any enemy troops you can.\n\n   Be sure it is enemy however, as it won't look good if we have any friendly fire issues on our first day on the job.\n
