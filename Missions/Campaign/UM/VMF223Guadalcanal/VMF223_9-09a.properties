Description September 9\nTime 1130\nWeather: Good\nCloud hight 3500 feet\nEstimated flight time 30 minutes\n\n\tTwo days ago one of the VMF-224 pilots, Second Lieutenant Richard Amerine, who went missing on their first mission reported what had happened to him. Both his Oxygen system and engine had failed, forcing him to ditch off cape esperance. Surviving off snails, red ants, and a few coconuts, he had reason to be glad he'd studied entomology in collage. During the course of 30 mile week long hike, he killed four japanese soldiers he encountered before making it back to henderson.\n\tOther news is that a runway is being built to the east of  Henderson to be called Fighter 1. We can expect to be moved there as soon as it is completed. \n\n\tTojo time has arrived early today, as the first report of incoming aircraft has arrived ten minutes ago at 1030 hours, and we are now finishing readying the planes. Same as always, get as many as you can.\n
