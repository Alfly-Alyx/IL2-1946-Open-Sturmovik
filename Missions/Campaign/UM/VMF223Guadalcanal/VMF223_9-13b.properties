Description September 13\nTime: 0845\nWeather: Clear\nCloud hight ---\nEstimated flight time 50 minutes\n\n\tIt began Yesterday at around 2100. Louie the Louse began dropping flares over the Edson's ridge.\n\tMinutes later the first shells began landing, coming from Jap destroyers, which for the most part landed to the east. Among the casualties though, were three dead pilots of VMSB-231. From then on I'm not sure even if the Marines on the ridge knew excactly what was happening. All we heard was first a sputtering of fire, then what grew into a medley of rifles, mortars, machineguns, and grenades.\tThis morning we received eighteen new wildcats for both us and VMF-224 to bolster our defence, and it looks as though we shall soon need them.\n\n\tNot long ago our planes came back after intercepting two Irving recon planes, and now coast watchers have told us that a raid is on its way. Some of our planes are still refeuling, so we won't be up at full strengh, but we can still chop up a few. See you in the air.\n
