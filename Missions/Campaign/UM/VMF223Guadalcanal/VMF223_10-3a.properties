Description October 3\nTime 1027\nweather Good\nCloud hight 4600ft\nestimated flight time 45 minutes\n\n\tIt sure seems the Japs have stopped their bomber attacks in order to try to draw us into a fight. We should take it as a complement. However, remember to be cautious, and stick together when fighting the zeke. They arn't invincible, but they are better then us in a one on one fight.\n\n\tSame as yesterday, RADAR has detected a flight of small fast aircraft approaching the airfeild. This time we've just enough time to get to altitude though, so climb as fast as you can to get above them before they reach us. \n\n\t\n
