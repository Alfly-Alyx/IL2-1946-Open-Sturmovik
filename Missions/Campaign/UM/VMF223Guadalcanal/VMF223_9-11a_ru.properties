Description September 11\nTime 1150\nWeather: good\nCloud Hight 3300ft\nEstimated flight time 40 minutes\n\n\tAs some of you already know, of the fourty four aircraft flown in sense August 20th, only eleven are currently flyable.  This should in no way stop us from doing our best to slow their attacks as much as possible, and I don't expect any of you to turn chicken now. We have faced worse odds before and come through, and we will again.\n\t\t\n\tWe have a raid coming in now, lets give them a welcome.\n
