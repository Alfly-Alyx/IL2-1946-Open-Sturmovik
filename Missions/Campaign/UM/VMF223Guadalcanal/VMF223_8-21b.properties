Description August-21\nWeather Good\ncloud hight 1100\nTime  1150 \nestimated flight time 45 minuits\n\n   All last night we were kept awake by every sort of gun imagineable. If every night is like this I don't forsee us getting much sleep. The word is they mounted an effort to retake the airfeild last night and were repelled after heavy fighting. Our own squadron played a roll when four of our aircraft helped strafe and sink several boats some Japs were trying to escape in.\n\n\t   We haven't had much sleep, but coast watchers have reported a formation of Japanese bombers coming in. \n\n\t   We only have four Wildcats feuled and armed, due to the action this morning so you'll have to be careful up there. Remember, if your damaged, your first priority is to return to base safely.\n
