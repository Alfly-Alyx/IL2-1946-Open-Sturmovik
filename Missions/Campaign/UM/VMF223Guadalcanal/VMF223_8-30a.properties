Description August 30\ntime 1121\nWeather Hazy\nCloud hight 5000ft\nEstimated flight time 45 minutes\n\n\tCoast Watchers have reported a large formation of single engine aircraft headed down the slot. Odds are they are Dive bombers after the transport William Ward Burrows which ran aground yesterday near Talugi.\n\tWe will be there to meet them in a three layered defence. The 67th will have P400s at the lower two levels, and we are going to make up the third layer at 28,000 feet to swoop down on them.\n\tWith any luck, we'll bag all of them. See you all back at base.\n
