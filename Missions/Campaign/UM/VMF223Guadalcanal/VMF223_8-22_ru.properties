Description August 22\nTime  1630\nWeather: Good\nCloud Hight: 2200ft\nestimated flight time: 2 hours\n\n\n   We have only been here two days and already we are being informed that we are short of both food and ammunition. Its not hard to tell things will get worse.\n\n   Our Japanese friends of course want to help by giving us some more company. A PBY sighted a convoy of transports approaching a few hours ago, and we're sending all we've got. Every flyable aircraft is taking off, as none of you need telling that if we don't turn them back today, we'll be feeling their presence in a week. \n
