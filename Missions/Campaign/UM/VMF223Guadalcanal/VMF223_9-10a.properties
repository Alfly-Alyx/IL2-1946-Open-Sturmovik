Description September 10\nTime 1050\nWeather Good\nCloud Hight 4000ft\nEstimated flight time 40 minutes\n\n\tFollowing the last raid's interception we lost an influential member of the Squadron. Captain Marion Carl, one of our top scoring Aces failed to return to base and is presently missing.\n Despite his loss, we still have a job to do, and a bomber formation is coming to meet us as we speak. Good luck.
