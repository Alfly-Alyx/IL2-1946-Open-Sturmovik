Description August-25\nTime: 1110\nWeather: Good\nCloud hight: 3000ft\nEstimated flight time: 45 minuits\n\nThis mornings attack, for those not involved, took place at around 0800. Although the escort turned back, the SBD's flew about 50 miles east and finally found the convoy.\n\nIt is beleived the Japanese mistook the SBD's for friendly aircraft because they offered no resistance until the SBD's had started their attack.\n\nmost bombs claimed near misses, but hits to at least two ships were recorded. SBD gunners also claimed two pete's shot down.\n\nWhen last spotted, just shortly after the attack, the convoy was moving north west, away from Guadalcanal\n\nCoast watchers spotted a bomber formation headed our way at 1100.\n\nWe have only just finished refeuling and rearming our planes, so it is unlikely we will be able to catch them if they are at the same altitude as last time. We will however do a lot more in the air in then on the ground, so we've little choice but to claim as many as we can.\n
