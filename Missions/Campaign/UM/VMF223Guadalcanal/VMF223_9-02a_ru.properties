Description September 2\nTIme 1110\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Hight ---\nEstimated flight time 40 minutes\n\n\tOn August 30th, we suffered a sobering display. Just at the end of Tojo time, Tojo decided to make an appearance. Unnfortunatly for us, and for the crew of the destroyer transport Colhoun, which was just off the Lunga point, all our aircraft were still refeuling from the fight over Tulagi, so they were in no way impeded when they hit her first with two direct hits, then a string of five or six near misses. The ship had only just begun to sink by the stern when she was directly hit again twice, causing her to go down with fifty of her crew.\n\tThere is better news however. An hour after the Colhoun was hit, Colonel William J. Wallace of MAG-23 arrived with the ninteen planes VMF-224.]\n\tOn August 31st, VMF224 received a rough welcom when they took off in response to what turned out to be a false alarm. After landing they found three of their pilots missing, with no explaination. Most likely they got lost due to little experiance with the terrain here.\n\tYesterday, September 1st, three dauntless's found another Cactus Express run and claimed one hit on a can. \n\tToday another Jap flight is coming down the slot, so we need to get up and give them a welcom.\n
