Description September 27\nTime 1250\nWeather Good\nCloud hight 3000ft\nEstimated flight time 45 minutes\n\n\tIts been pretty quiet for us fighter pilots ever sense September 14th. For the first time, people can be seen more than a sprinting distance from their dugouts during Tojo Time. Some marines have even dared wonder if the Japs have given up after the battle at Edson's ridge. The Dive bombers and Torpedo bombers have been kept busy however, attacking shipping and other targets.\n\tThere have been several notable events though. On the 18th, at 0700, the 7th Marines and their supporting artillary of the 1st Battalion, 11th Marines began landing. The Sailors lost their welcom however when ship gunners mistakenly shot down a patrolling SBD. Its pilot was never recovered.\n\n\tWe also have had our aircraft moved to the Fighter one airstrip, which should allow us to mount interceptions sooner.\n\n\tCoast watchers have just reported a massive flight of aircraft approaching, so get off the ground quick!\n\t\n
