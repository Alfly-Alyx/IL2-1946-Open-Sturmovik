Description August 25\nTime 0600\nWeather Hazy\nCloud hight 2100ft\nEstimated flight time 3hours 15 minuits\n\n\tLast night we heard a constant rolling thunder of distant naval guns. At midnight we began receiving shells from at least three Jap cans. This went on for about ten minuits, but only very minor damage was done.\n\nat 0230 three SBD's left to try to find the Japs responsible for the shelling, without success. At 0400 three more SBD's attempted the same thing and claimed a possible hit. One of the SBD's became lost on the way back, and so far we have been unable to locate them. At about the same time we were informed of an enemy convoy to the north by a patrolling Catalina.\n\n\tYou will accompany our dive bombers but due to feul limitations, if the enemy ships have not been spotted before the end of the search arc, then you must head back alone. Good Hunting.\n
