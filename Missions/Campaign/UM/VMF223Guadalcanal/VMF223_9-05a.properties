Description September 5\nTime 1420\nWeather: Blind\nCloud hight 1200ft\nEstimated flight time 30 minutes\n\n\tOn September 3rd we had the honor of welcoming Brigadier General Roy S. Geiger who arrived after dark in a R4D\n\tHowever, this morning we suffered another Humilation off Lunga point at 0103 hours when a PBY accidently illuminated the destroyer transports Little and Gregory, not knowing of their presence and beleiving them to be enemy. Unfortunatly a Cactus express run had been moving past and both ships were pummeled after being further illuminated by Jap spotlights from several destroyers. At sunrise, 238 men were fished from the water, leaving thirty three men unaccounted for. \n\tLater this morning, an assortment of aircraft left to strafe barges reported moving near Marovovo, and claimed 15 thouroughly holed.\n\n\tNow, however, clouds have moved in over guadalcanal just as Coast Watchers are reporting a flight of bombers incoming. Its unlikely they would be able to hit anything, but we're going to meet them anyway.\n\tGood luck\n
