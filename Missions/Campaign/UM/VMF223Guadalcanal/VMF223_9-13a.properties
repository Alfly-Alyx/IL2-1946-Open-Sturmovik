Description September 13\nTime 0755\nWeather Poor\nCloud hight 2400ft\nEstimated flight time 30 minutes\n\n\tIt began Yesterday at around 2100. Louie the Louse began dropping flares over the Edson's ridge.\n\tMinutes later the first shells began landing, coming from Jap destroyers, which for the most part landed to the east. Among the casualties though, were three dead pilots of VMSB-231. From then on I'm not sure even if the Marines on the ridge knew excactly what was happening. All we heard was first a sputtering of fire, then what grew into a medley of rifles, mortars, machineguns, and grenades.\tThis morning we received eighteen new wildcats for both us and VMF-224 to bolster our defence, and it looks as though we shall soon need them.\n\t\n\tA report just arrived that a strange flight of japanese aircraft are coming down the slot at what is estimated 1200ft. Take off and intercept, we can't take much more of this.\n
