Name Strike Chi Chi Jima
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 1st March 1945\n\nDOG+10\n\nIwo Jima and the rest of the Volcano-Bonin islands are shrouded in mystery for most people here.  I think the Japs have kept this place secret for years.  The main Jap base is on Chi Chi Jima to the North.  We know that's where all enemy comms from Iwo go.  Our forces have been striking Chi Chi and its surrounding islands for months, almost with the same intensity that we'd previously been hitting Iwo.\n\nPilots who've been over Chi Chi rarely talk about it.  There's something about that place that gives them the creeps.  It's like you're entering the darkest corner of the Japanese Empire; a place that's mysterious and evil.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nYou're on Chi-Chi Jima strike with VT-6.  Your primary target is the port of Omura.  Secondary target is the communications facilities located on the upper elevations of the island.  VT-6 will also be hitting Susaki Airfield, which as you know is the nearest staging post for enemy aircraft who want to hit Iwo Jima.  If any bogeys intervene, break off the strike and adopt the escort role.\n\nOn your return, we'd like you to take a look at the seaplane facility at Ha Ha Jima.  Note any sign you can of recent activity.  We believe the enemy is using seaplanes to monitor our own communications traffic, and Ha Ha Jima looks to be an obvious staging post.\n\n
