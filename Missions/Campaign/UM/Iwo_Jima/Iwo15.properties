Name Strike Hill 382
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 26th February 1945\n\nDOG+7\n\nIt seems the main enemy defense network is based to the East of Airfield 2, around a series of positions that the Marines have collectively called the "Meatgrinder".  The most conspicious of these is Hill 382, named for its elevation, that is the second highest peak on the island.  \n\nThere appears to be a command centre  on the upper slope of this feature from where enemy forward units are being co-ordinated.  In front of 382 is a natural bowl that has been named "the Amphitheater".  It's bare, uncovered and a natural killing ground for the Japs on 382 and on the "Turkey Knob", a gnarled hillock near by.  \n\nAlso dangerous is the village of Minami to the South, which has been desecrated by Naval shellfire, and is built up with enemy gun emplacements.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nRight men, we're gonna have another go at Hill 382.  The target will be marked in the familiar fashion.\n\nAfter delivering your ordnance, you will turn round and escort R4D's from VMR-952, who will be dropping supplies to our rear area.  Even after opening Purple beach on the west coast, our supply situation is still lacking. \n\nThey're getting pretty much short of everything out there, but the grim joke from the Marines is what they need most is bullets, blood, and the pre-printed crosses that are stocked by the burial parties.\n\n
