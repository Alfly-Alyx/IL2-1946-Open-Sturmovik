Name Strike Hot Rocks
Short \n
Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 20th February 1945\n\nDOG+1\n\nThe nature of the battle for this dirtheap is starting to reveal itself, and it doesn't look good.  Whoever has been laying out the defenses sure is one mean, smart bastard.  \n\nThe enemy are holding the high ground at both ends of the island, on Suribachi in the south, and the Motoyama plateau in the north.  From there they can survey the whole island and fire on any target that reveals itself.  There's hardly anywhere that isn't in the open.  I've heard one Marine describe it as like fighting a battle on a pool table.\n\nEvery likely holding position has been pre-registered by the Japanese artillery.  The few possible places of shelter have been either mined or booby-trapped, or both.\n\nTo top it all, the weather is predicted to get worse.  People forget it's winter out here, and we're getting further and further north.  We can hear the Marines over the net talking about it.  They can feel the cold air around them, but still the warm volcanic heat coming from below the ground.  It makes them shiver and sweat at the same time.  \n\n-------------------------------\n\nYou'll be supporting the assault on Hot Rocks this afternoon.  Targets are the bunkers and pillboxes at the base of the mountain that are currently holding up the 28th Marines' attack.\n\nWe're having repeated reports from other squadrons of napalm not igniting.  We're investigating the cause of this, but in the meantime you'll just have to drop and pray.\n\nFollow your strike with a CAP around the North of the island.  We've got CVE's and destroyers on picket duty who are starting to get jumpy.  The number of unidentified radar contacts appears to be increasing.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nHere's a reminder of the drill for getting heavy loads of the deck:\n\nExtend wings\nLock tail wheel\nSet flaps to take off position\nSet rudder trim 10 clicks to starboard\nSet elevator trim nose up.\nSet radiator closed\nSet full power + WEP\nRelease chocks\nRetract undercarriage the instant you leave the deck\nWhen you stabilise at the bottom of the drop, retract flaps immediately\n\n(Power down and open rads when appropriate)\n\n
