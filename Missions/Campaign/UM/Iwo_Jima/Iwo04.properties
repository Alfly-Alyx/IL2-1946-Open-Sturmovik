Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 19th February 1945\n\nDOG, HOW-1\n\nWatching the Marines loading up is always uneasy.  You can tell the greenhorns by the way they take the cargo nets.  Most of these guys are experienced though; they take everything as matter-of-fact.\n\nThe Naval personnel are packing the decks to watch the landing craft take them off.  They all feel the same mixture of admiration and sadness.  These Marines are the most resolute-looking guys I've ever seen, but we know a lot of them aren't gonna make it back.  \n\nThere's a sense this is going to be their toughest test yet.  The Japs have had a long time to prepare the defenses, and from the depressing evidence of our recon, the air and naval bombardments have not been effective.\n\nWe flyboys haven't got time to stick around and eyeball, though.  We're the busiest people round here, except for maybe the gunners.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nOK men, you've heard Admiral Mitscher's instructions - he wants you to drag your bellies along the beach.  It's not been often in this campaign that the Marines have been in the same place as their air support, so when they cheer you go by, I want you to put on a show for them.\n\nYou will be hitting Red beach, adjacent to Green beach on the furthermost left flank.  VBF-6 from Hancock will hit Yellow beach in the centre, and VMF-213 will take care of Blue on the extreme right.\n\nYour targets are "Priority B"; that is anything that may interfere with ship-to-shore movement.  This means any form of artillery, HMG, dual-purpose AA or other ground-based element directed against the assault waves.\n\nTake it as read that any enemy position that has the impertinance to open up on you should also be terminated with prejudice.\n\n
