Name Dawn CAP
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 1st March 1945\n\nDOG+10\n\nThe shocking casualty figures that are coming in from the island are bad enough in themselves, but there are even graver problems hidden in the numbers.\n\nWhat's starting to become acute is the lack of leadership, due to the heavy loss of officers.  In some Companies the commanding role has gone from Captain to Lieutenant to Sergeant.  Some units pretty much exist in name only; they're just a few remnants concatenated with the ragged remains of neighboring outfits.\n\nWe're also starting to see significant battle fatigue.  Guys are brought out of the line because they just aren't able to function anymore.  And as a lot of them are being rotated with battle replacements rather than organic ones, there are a lot of green kids being sent out there who are getting wiped unnecessarily.  It's difficult enough surviving on a normal battlefield, but on an extraordinary one like Iwo Jima, your chances are slim to none.\n\nThat said, the Marines aren't wavering.  Our enemy's losses must be worse, and I guess both sides know by now there's only going to be one outcome.  Just sad that so many good men out there aren't going to be around to witness it.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nRight men, you're on the dawn CAP this morning.   Take a look out to the Northeast sector and see what you can find.  We haven't had many splashes so far.  Hopefully you can rectify this.\n\nAnd I can't believe I have to keep telling you men this, but please keep to the correct VHF channel for CAP patrols.  As you well know, open channels are for strike parties ONLY.  They do not want to know your landing position, whether you can see the LSO, what you had for lunch or exactly how much of an asshole your crew chief is.\n\nI want radio discipline restored IMMEDIATELY.\n\n
