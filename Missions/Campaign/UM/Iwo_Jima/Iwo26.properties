Name Strike Hill 362C
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 7th March 1945\n\nDOG+16\n\nAlthough progress on the left flank and centre has been made, progress on the right has been slender at best. 4th Division is still mired in the Meatgrinder, with Turkey Knob still proving the most formidable obstacle.\n\nWe hear that General Erskine is planning a dawn attack on positions north of the Meatgrinder, in order to drive a wedge in the Japanese lines and reach the northeast coast.  I guess he thinks that our attacks are becoming too predictable, and is trying to lever position by infiltration.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n21st Marines have just tried a pre-dawn jump off to invest Hill 362C.  The Commander of 3/9 (attached) radioed through at 6.00 to confirm that they'd seized the objective.\n\nUnfortunately when the light improved he got to realise he was on the wrong Hill - 331, 250 yards short of the objective.  By then the Japs had woken up and they're now bogged down and under intense incoming fire.\n\nWe need to help get the assault moving again.  OY's have identified defilade positions behind the hill that are a likely source of mortar fire.  Corps will mark the target with flares.  Cover the position with napalm, and then egress the target.  \n\nKeep a look out over your shoulder for any enemy tactical movement that may further compromise our re-ordered assault.\n\n
