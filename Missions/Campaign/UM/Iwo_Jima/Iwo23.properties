Name "Dinah Might"
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 4th March 1945\n\nDOG+13\n\nVMR-952 landed their first R5C on the island today.  It's funny how one side of Iwo is starting to operate as a functioning base, whereas the other side is still the scene of a ferocious battle.\n\nOf course the Japs like to send reminders to the rest of the island that they're still there, but that's only a temporary interrupt to the daily flow.  \n\nWe're just starting to get some understanding of the awesome scale of the base that's been planned here.  If the Japs could see the offensive power that's being built up, even they might be persuaded of the futility of their cause.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nReports are coming in of a disabled B-29 requesting to land on Iwo.  This is what this whole damn operation has been for.\n\nI want you to cover her approach, and make sure she's protected from enemy ground fire.  If any Jap so much as throws a rock at that bird, I want you to nail his balls to the Moon.\n\nEvery Marine, Seabee, Corpsman and Shoreman on that island will have their eyes on "Dinah Might".  I want the Japs to hear their cheers and whistles when she touches down in one piece.\n\n
