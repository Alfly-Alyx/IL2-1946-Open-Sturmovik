Name Strike Sulphur Mine
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 27th February 1945\n\nDOG+8\n\nWe've been watching some of the hospital ships travelling backwards and forwards from the island.  Talking to one of the Navy doctors, he reckons Iwo has produced some of the most horrendous injuries he's ever seen.\n\nMostly it's due to the lack of cover.  Incoming arty and mortar fire can detonate sideways and take out a whole rake of men.  On the plus side the medical care for the Marines is second-to-none.  Almost every casualty gets whole blood when they need it, and the Marine surgeons are just about the best there is.\n\nIt ain't so good for the field medics though.  The Navy Corpsmen have been taking heavy losses.  It's 'cause the Japs like to leave injured marines as bait, and then pick off anyone who tries to help them.  The Japs aren't averse to calling "Corpsman!" themselves, just to lure them over.\n\nIt's truly a world without pity over there, and I'm glad I only have to pass over it.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n1/9 have called in another strike, this time against suspected enemy mortar positions.  \n\nHit the marked defilade positions behind the Motoyama sulphur mine, then run a CAP to the northwest.  Enemy air activity has typically been low-key during this operation, but isolated groups of raiders are still making the occasional appearance.\n\n
