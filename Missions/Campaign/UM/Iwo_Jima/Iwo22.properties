Name Strike Airfield 3
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 2nd March 1945\n\nDOG+11\n\nAt last we've hit the O-2 line, at least with our central advance.  When General Smith made his outline at the start of the operation he called for a "frontal assault maintained with relentless pressure", and the Marines have been good for that.\n\nOur co-ordination has got much more efficient, and we're answering calls in a more timely manner.  We hear the boys down there really appreciate it.\n\nThere's still a long way to go, but the whole Corps is really working as a team, and you can feel that momentum carrying us forward.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n3/9 have called up a strike Strike on the ridge running West from Hill 362-B, overlooking the unfinished Airfield 3.  The strike will be marked and controlled in the usual fashion, so I'm expecting you guys to do the job with as little incident as possible.  Marine infantry will be backing up the strike with armor support, so as ever be on the lookout for friendlies.\n\nYou'll all be pleased to know that Airfield 1 is now open to receive carrier aircraft, should you need it.  Make sure you clear your approach, as traffic at this facility is starting to build in density.  Be aware that First Air Evac Squadron 2 R4D's will be arriving at Iwo today.  They will have priority status over all but emergency requests.\n\n
