Name Tank Attack At Motoyama
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 28th February 1945\n\nDOG+9\n\nThe enemy have utilised almost anything they can find as weapons.  Old naval shells have been dug into the ground with their fuses exposed as land mines.  Rockets are fired from improvised trolleys.  They've got these fearsome mortars that are fired from ceramic tubes a foot in diameter.  The Marines hate them because they can hear them coming, but there's no predicting where they 'll land.  We think a few of them just go straight up and land on their creators.\n\nThere's a few tanks on the island, but most are dug in.  They're very effective as they're compact and difficult to locate.  The Japs use them when they want to hit something accurately and fast.  That's been the story of this offensive.  Hardly anybody sees who or what is trying to kill them, until it's too late.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nOY's are reporting enemy armor amassing at Motoyama village, ahead of the direction of attack of 23rd Marines.\n\nYou're on for the first strike.  You'll be armed with AP rockets.  Maintain station over the battlefield and take out any enemy armor you can find.  Break off any engagement that may endanger friendly units.\n\n
