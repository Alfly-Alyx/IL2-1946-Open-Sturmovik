Name Strike Airfield 1
Short \n
Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 20th February 1945\n\nDOG+1\n\nThe enemy counter-attack predicted for last night didn't happen.  Everyone's surprised, as usually the Japs like to get at us during the first night of the landing.  It's worrying too;  counter-attacks are normally the anvil on which we break the enemy.\n\nWe took a lot of casualties on D-Day.  Saddest thing was so many of them were Seabees.  They're all volunteers from the construction industry back home, and most times they're too old for regular service.  In fact the Marine joke is "Always look after your Seabees.  One of them might be your Dad!".\n\nWe've had to rely on their 'dozers to open the beach exits and bring supplies forward.  All the wheeled vehicles like the DUKW's just lodge themselves in the sand.  Even the armor is finding it tough going.\n\nStill with redoubtable men like those in the Construction Battalions behind us, I'm sure we will prevail.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWhile 28th Marines turn their attention to Mt. Suribachi, the bulk of VAC will push North and attempt to reach the O-1 line.  Our task is to help RCT 23 punch through the middle of Airfield 1.\n\nAs you approach the target, arty will mark it with white smoke.  F6F's from Lexington's VF-9 will neutralise flak positions ahead of your run.\n\n4th Division will be co-ordinating their advance with your strike.  Do not attack targets of opportunity, to prevent the risk of engaging friendlies.  Keep a watchful eye out for M4's who will be supporting our offensive.\n\n
