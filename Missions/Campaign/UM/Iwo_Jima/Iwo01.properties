Name Destroy the Coastal Guns

Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 18th February 1945\n\nDOG-1\n\nAs the Fast Carrier task force under Admiral Mitscher, we've been conducting raids on Honshu, Okinawa and the Northern Bonins in order to suppress enemy air operations during the period of Detachment.\n\nNow we're steaming toward Iwo Jima to support the D-Day phase.  Up till now, most of the air cover over Iwo has been provided by the CVE's of TF52, the assault fleet.  \n\nThere's been the usual frap between the Marines and the Navy regarding the duration of the pre-assault bombardment, with the Navy as usual getting it's way.  \n\nWe hear that General Smith is in despair over the Navy's continuing tendency to want to preserve it's ammunition.  We all know the Navy has its strategic reasons to limit these bombardments, but privately everybody knows that saving shells has a cost in Marine lives.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nNavy UDT teams have been clearing the shore approaches from mines and tetrahedrons, but their Higgins boats have come under fire from coastal gun emplacements around The Quarry and Mount Suribachi.\n\nAs well as interfering with our underwater demolition, these guns are preventing our DD's closing on shore and selecting targets of special interest.  As such, they have been designated a "Priority A" target.\n\nOur battleships have put the quarry guns out of business, but the Suribachi guns are proving a tougher nut  to crack.  As it is considered a pinpoint strike will be most effective, you have been tasked with silencing those guns for good.\n\nYou will see the target directly ahead of you at the base of Mount Suribachi.  The guns are emplaced in concrete casements.  Keep your belly low and try and aim your rockets at any visible apertures, as this is likely to result in the most significant damage.  Your flight leader will take care of any proximate AAA positions.\n\nF4U's of VMF-213, from Essex, will be striking positions on the north of the island.  Call them in if you need any assistance.\n\n
