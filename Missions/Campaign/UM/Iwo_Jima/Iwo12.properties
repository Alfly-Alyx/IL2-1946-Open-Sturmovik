Name Attack Airfield 2 Approaches
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 23rd February 1945\n\nDOG+4\n\nHalf an hour ago every siren and whistle in the fleet was being sounded.  We heard that Old Glory had just gone up on the summit of Hot Rocks.  The 28th did a magnificent job up there.  It must be a bitter blow to the Japanese to lose such a powerful defensive position.  Not that it wasn't without grevious loss to ourselves, though.\n\n4th Division are encroaching toward Airfield 2.  The battle for Airfield 1 has been bloody and bitter.  Yet again, the Japs have second guessed us.  They'd sighted every possible avenue of approach, and prepared their fire.  Most deadly were airburst AA shells that were zero'd in on the airfield entrances.  'Cause that field is so flat these were particularly devastating due to our lack of cover.\n\nWhat's frustrating for the Marines is that hardly anyone has seen a Jap.  At least a live one.  All they get to see are a few burnt corpses left lying from our air strikes, or from the "Ronson" M4's.  When they've investigated captured bunkers, they've seen the Japanese Battle Vows.  We've been told they translate as a promise to kill 10 Americans for each one that surfeits his life for the Emperor.\n\nOn current form, we reckon they're meeting their obligations comfortably.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe results from the Japanese air raid of two days ago are as follows:  CV Saratoga damaged and returned ot base,  CVE Bismark Sea sunk 20m East of Iwo, CVE Lurga Point damaged, Tender Koekuk damaged.  One LST, 477, damaged.  That's bad but were it not for your efforts, it could have been a lot worse.\n\nTF58 has departed for another strike on Tokyo, but Enterprise has been attached to TF52 to provide Dawn and dusk CAP, ASP and Strike/Interdiction.  We're going to be on board Big E as part of the air complement.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n3/21 have called in strikes in order to support their advance on Airfield 2.  They want us to hit positions to the fore of Charlie-Dog ridge.  Corps artillery will mark the target with white smoke flares.  On the right flank, the "Buck Rogers" boys will be hitting the Quarry with their rocket trucks.  Try to keep above the trajectory of friendly projectiles while you circulate over the target.\n\n
