Description Airfield One, Iwo Jima, 6th March 1945\n\nDOG+15\n\nI don't envy the Army boys picking up the air operations from us.  They've got one hell of a lot to learn.\n\nSupport operations have become pretty sophisticated on Iwo, and an easy transition to operating the various SAD networks is difficult enough without factoring in the Corps Artillery Fire Direction Control and the Naval gunfire requirements.\n\nBefore each strike gets a number, we have to make sure Arty know where we're headed from, how low we intend to pass, what we're carrying, and how long we intend to stick around.  To co-ordinate with the Navy is even more complex, and plan "VICTOR" comes into effect.\n\nI hope those grunts are good with the math, or they're gonna be escorted by 155mm on every run.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nP-51's from 47th FS 15th FG are headed in as the advance elements of VII Fighter Command.  They're here to start the work up for garrison duties by taking over the day CAP from the CVE's.  After familiarisation with the AGC network, they'll be answering support calls too.\n\nGet up and welcome them in.  Those guys are gonna be feeling the fatigue of coming all the way in from Saipan.  They'll be dog tired by the time they get their wheels on the dirt of Iwo.  It won't be long though before they're up to escort the B-29s.  When that happens, the marines who've been chewing the sand for the last four weeks will know their sacrifices have been worth it.\n\nRendezvous point is Waypoint 6 at Angels 4 (1200m), at 1500hrs.\n\n
