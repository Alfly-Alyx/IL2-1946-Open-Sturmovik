Name Attack Hills Peter and 199
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 25th February 1945\n\nDOG+6\n\n4th Division are still locked in battle for Airfield 2.  The Japanese occupy a number of hills around the field that provide them with excellent observation of our movement.  Their fire control is  real clever.  They're firing in short bursts from a number of diverse positions, in order to avoid being ID'd and subjected to counter-battery fire and air strikes.\n\nAt least we've reached the O-1 line, though that was scheduled for D-Day.  Our casualties are starting to become a real cause for concern, being much higher than we anticipated.  And we anticipated a fair number.  One of the real problems on the island is that because everywhere is under observation and within range of enemy arty, there's no proper rear areas where our men can shelter and recuperate.  You're always in the front line no matter who you are or what you do.\n\nThat's what's making death so random here.  There are experienced guys with several combat tours under their belts who are being killed within an hour of stepping on Iwo.  Doesn't matter if you're a good soldier or a bad soldier; if you're a hero or a coward.  All you've got to be to survive this place is lucky.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWe're getting strikes being called in over the net every 15 minutes or less, gentlemen.  There's been a lot of complaints from forward observation about the length of time it's taking us to organise strikes after they make the call.\n\nThe LFACU is trying to streamline the screening process, but until then we can only go when we get the correct authorisation. \n\nYou've got familiar targets this time - Hills Peter and OBOE-199.  The Japs are sticking to those positions like shit to a rug.  Fortunately the supply situation with 500lb bombs has been improving, so let's see if those'll shake them off.  Corps artillery have flared the target, so you've got no excuse for an incorrect ID.\n\n
