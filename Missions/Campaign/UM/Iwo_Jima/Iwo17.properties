Name Prevent Enemy Re-supply
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 27th February 1945\n\nDOG+8\n\nAs with most of our operations against the Japanese, night-time is when they like to infiltrate, and on Iwo Jima their existing tunnel network allows them to do this just about anywhere on the island.  Positions that have long been passed can suddenly sprout Japs.\n\nThe Marines are pretty wise to this now, and the Japs rarely last long.  Often they just get beaten to death.  By the time the Marines are finished with them, their bodies are so broken up you could fold them over your arm like a raincoat.\n\nOne of the things that spooks the guys is the big land crabs you find on Iwo.  One of them scuttles by and it sounds like a whole crowd of enemy.  More than one guy has had his uniform covered in crab meat by a jumpy sentry.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSigInt have been picking up enemy signals for some time suggesting the Japanese intend to re-supply their garrison at Iwo by air.  We're picking up a cluster of unidentified blips on our radar.\n\nThis might be the one.  Get airborne, and you will be vectored to the target.\n\n
