Short \n
Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 19th February 1945\n\nDOG, HOW+14\n\nOur ships are using smoke to protect themselves in the East Boat Basin.  We know it works well, but we also know the crews don't like using it.  It causes all sorts of respiratory problems.  I've heard stories of entire crews greeting the dawn by heaving over the side as soon as the generators are turned off.\n\nOn some ships they keep finding "malfunctions" with the equipment.  It's their risk I suppose.  Guess it depends whether you want to be sick every night, or take a Jap bomb one night and finish your health problems once and for all.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nSaratoga has picked up two bogeys coming in from the Northeast.  Nightfighter F6F's on CAP are too distant to vector in.\n\nYou guys are going to have to improvise.  Take the route most likely to lead to an interception.  Our boys have enough to do to cope with Japanese ground infiltration.  Don't let enemy air elements add to their discomfort.\n\n
