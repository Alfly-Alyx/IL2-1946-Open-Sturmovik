Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 9th March 1945\n\nDOG+18\n\nAs we've penetrated into the hinterland of the Japanese defences we're finally starting to see the conditions they've been fighting under.  We're starting to see a few live ones; or at least barely alive.\n\nWe've found them in their tunnels and command posts.  Wounded mostly, and sick.  A lot of them are being eaten from the inside by maggots and lice.  The smell is apparently horrendous; it even rises above the sulfurus smell of Iwo.\n\nThe Japs didn't do much for their wounded.  They were usually patched up and then propped in position to die.  Really, they'd have been better off with a bullet.\n\nSurprisingly enough, we're starting to get a few surrenders as well.  Mostly Koreans and Okinawans.  The Intelligence guys are all over them.  They're even talking of using them to persuade the remaining Japs to surrender.\n\nWell, we can all live in hope, I s'pose.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe Japs have captured an M4 and are playing hell with it around the village of Higashi.  Be vigilant, as friendly armor is also in the vicinity.\n\nP-51's will be taking part in strikes against possible enemy positions to the rear.  Be mindful of their presence and keep a good distance.  They're still learning their trade out here.\n\nEnterprise is steaming to rejoin TF58 today, so you'll be transferring to one of TF52's jeeps.\n\n
