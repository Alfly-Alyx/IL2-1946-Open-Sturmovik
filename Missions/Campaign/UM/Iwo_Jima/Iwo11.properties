Name Kamikaze Attack 2
Short \n
Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 21st February 1945\n\nDOG+2\n\nBoy!  The enemy is hitting us all over the place!  We thought they'd abandoned their Iwo garrison for good, but they're returning with a vengeance this evening.\n\nThe AA gunners have been on overdrive.  For them it's almost personal, like a one-on-one with every kamikaze.  Guys who've been on the guns say it's THE most intense form of combat you can experience.  You can see this by the way they'll keep firing on an enemy plane long after it's started going down.  Even when it's hit the water, those pumped-up guys will keep firing at the splashes.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nOK men, I know you all want to hear about Saratoga.  Well, the good news is the fire crews have managed to stop the burning, and she was able to recover most of her planes.  Bad new is she's not playing any further part in this operation.   She's aready making her way back to Pearl Harbor with her escorts.\n\nLet's make sure nobody else has to follow.  The next enemy wave is coming in.  This time we're more prepared.  I want to see plenty of splashes from you guys.  Let's make the Japs pay for what they did to Sara.\n\n
