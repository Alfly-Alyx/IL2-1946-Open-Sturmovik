Name Kamikaze Attack!
Short \n
Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 21st February 1945\n\nDOG+2\n\nAs the evening is approaching the weather is starting to clear.  We're putting up  more strikes again, which is what the Marines have been crying out for.\n\nThey've been meeting incredible resistance.  The Japanese defenses are by far the strongest we've ever experienced.  Every enemy position is well camouflaged, and when we do discover one and try and invest it, we find that it's mutually supported by at least three others.\n\nEven when the Marines manage to reach one, they find it's been so well constructed that only demolition charges have a chance of destroying it.  The local sand may be difficult to pass through, but it sure seems to make good concrete.\n\nAlso, they're almost impossible to spot from the air.  We need to make direct hits with 500lb'ers.  It would be a tough job even if we had enough of them, but every large bomb might as well be made of gold for how rare they are right now.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nAlert! Saratoga has reported radar contact with 50+ bogeys coming in from Hachijo Jima.  The first wave is about to hit the fleet now, so get up there and get busy!\n\n
