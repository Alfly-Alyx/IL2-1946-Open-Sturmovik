Name Dusk CAP with P-51's
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 8th March 1945\n\nDOG+17\n\nWe're hearing murmurings now about joining the work up for Okinawa.  It's amazing how quickly a place can go from being the center of the World's attention to a military backwater.\n\nI guess the only reason it still commands any attention at all is the casualty figures, that have long passed severe, and are starting to border on tragic.  They're already by far the worst Marine casualty figures of the war, and we're nowhere near done yet.  There's a feeling all round that there's some hard questions to be asked about this operation.\n\nThere's also some hard questions got to be asked about how we deal with the Japanese.  If they'll fight like this over a dirt heap like Iwo, how will they fight when we reach Japan proper?  The Marines here have been outstanding; you can tell that from the stories you hear every day, and yet it's still taken us weeks to clear objectives that were scheduled to take days.\n\nI don't know if there's another way, but they'll sure have to come up with one.  And fast.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n47th FS will be conducting their first dusk CAP.  You'll be there to hold their hands while they familiarise themselves with patrolling in these conditions.  \n\nThose lucky fella's are going to be stuck on Iwo for the foreseeable future, so let's get them off on the good foot, so they don't have to learn the hard way like we've done.\n\n
