Name Strike Kangoku Rock
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 6th March 1945\n\nDOG+15\n\n3rd Marines were sent back to Guam yesterday, without ever having set foot on the island.  Even when they were crying out for reinforcements, General Smith kept them on the boats.\n\nNo-one knows the reason why they weren't landed.  There was some blah about there already being too many men on the island, but nobody really believes it.  It's left kind of a bad taste in everybody's mouths; like this was a bad decision, but the high command won't admit it.\n\nA rumor has been going round that Germany has surrendered.  That's turned out to be false.  Maybe it was started by the Army personnel, who're starting to turn up in numbers.  They usually complain about the Marines leaving them a mess to clear up, but I don't think so this time.  I think the Marines will finish this one to every last Jap.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n5th Div. are reporting harassing fire from their left flank.  We suspect there are enemy guns located on Kangoku rock, off the Northwest coast of Iwo.  Strike any identified enemy installations on the rock, then run a CAP over the Northwest sector.\n\nWhen you have completed your patrol, you will land on Airfield 1.  From there you will report to the LFASCU.  Garrison aircraft will be arriving later today, and we want a smooth turn over in support operations.  \n\nYou will answer any questions the ComASCU may have regarding our role and response within the AGC network.  Any information we can provide to better facilitate the transition of ground support operations to the Army will be invaluable to the continued prosecution of Detachment.\n\n
