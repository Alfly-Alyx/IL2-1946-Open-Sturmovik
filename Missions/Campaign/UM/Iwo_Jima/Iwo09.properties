Name Hot Rocks in the Rain
Short \n
Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 21st February 1945\n\nDOG+2\n\nHeavy rain began falling towards the end of yesterday, and it's continuing into today.  As well as making the men cold and miserable the rain is turning the volcanic ash of Iwo into a sticky glue that impedes movement further.\n\nThe wind is whipping up the swell making navigation dangerous, so the beach has been closed to all but emergency traffic.\n\n28th are continuing their offensive on Hot Rocks.  It appears that the Japs on the mountain almost have their own organisation and planning away from the rest of the island.   Seems the Japs expected to have the island cut in half early on in the battle, and have adapted their planning accordingly.\n\nThe dark shadow of Suribachi is a baleful presence for the Marines.  They know hostile eyes are watching over them every minute of the day.  I hear a few of them feel compelled to cross themselves every time they look at it.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nThe foul weather means the Navy have cancelled all fires and air strikes, but we're gonna keep on going.\n\nYour target is again Hot Rocks, but this time you'll be carrying rockets.  28th have called for pinpoint strikes against the upper elevations.  There are a number of bunkers and strongpoints that need divesting before they can continue the advance.\n\nAs ever, keep your eyes open for friendlies.  The nature of the terrain on the island, and the intelligent exploitation of it by the enemy, means that our boys over there are fighting them cheek-by-jowl.  In some places our front lines are only 25 yards apart.  I'm calling on you guys to use every ounce of skill, courage and judgement you possess in order to persevere with your assignments.\n\n
