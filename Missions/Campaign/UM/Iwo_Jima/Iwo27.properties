Name Strike Kita
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 8th March 1945\n\nDOG+17\n\nThe Japanese never fail to amaze us with their capacity for lethal surprises.\n\n5th Division's advance on the left flank was going surprisingly smoothly yesterday.  They passed North of the village of Nishi and took the overlooking ridges with uncharacteristically light resistance.\n\nJust then, the Japanese detonated their command post within the ridge.  The whole island heard the explosion.  43 Marines were killed, and a whole lot more were injured.\n\nThat's one thing you can rely on from the Japs; they always play for keeps.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nStrike the village of Kita in advance of the assault by 5th Division, then head to Waypoint 7 at Angels 2 (600m) to meet up with the TBM's of VMTB-242.  They'll be based on Iwo for Day and Night ASP work.  Once they're close enough to be covered by our AAA at Waypoint 9, climb up to Angels 5 (1500m) at Waypoint 11 and run an anti-snooper patrol to the South of the fleet.  \n\nWe've been picking up unexplained radar contacts in this vicinity all morning, but so far have not had a confirmed ID.  It may just be weather effects or inexperienced operators, but although the enemy don't seem to be interested in supporting their garrison on Iwo, they still seem keen to track what we're up to.\n\n
