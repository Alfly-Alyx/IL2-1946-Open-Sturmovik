Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 1st March 1945\n\nDOG+10\n\nIt's starting to become apparent that we've hit the enemy's main defensive line.  The thoroughness of the positions we're encountering is something to behold.\n\nWe're starting to discover just how the Japanese are able to make their movements without us detecting them.  Close inspection of captured bunkers is starting to reveal a tunnel network under the island that is startling in its extensiveness.\n\nA lot of marines have reported hearing Japanese voices when they're well behind our lines.  Everyone put that down to battle fatigue or tiredness, but it now seems that the Japs have been beneath us all the time.  They're literally IN the island.  No wonder we hardly ever see them!\n\nAnd the only way we can get at them is to burn or blow them out.  The main weapons in this battle on our side are flame throwers and demolition charges.  In their turn, the Japs are using carefully sighted machine guns and low-concentration artillery and mortar fire.  It's as grim as it gets, but we've got no choice but to prevail.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nIt's an Anti-Submarine Patrol for you gentlemen this evening.  VT-6 TBM's equipped with search radar will be conducting the hunt.  We're picking up strong contacts to the north of the fleet, so escort them to the target area and make sure they come back safe.\n\nStay clear of the main enemy base of Chi Chi Jima.  We believe Susaki airfield is still operative despite the best efforts of 7th Air Force.\n\n
