Name Strike Ha Ha Jima
Short \n
Description USS Natoma Bay, Task Force 52, 11th March 1945\n\nDOG+20\n\nThe remainder of the fleet are moving off today, giving us our last glimpse of Iwo.  It's not a sight many of us will particularly miss.  The Marines are still out there fighting, and there's plenty more fighting to be done; but the Japs are pretty much broken now.\n\n3rd Division has finally reached the Northeast coast.  The patrol that got there first sent a canteen of seawater back to General Erskine.  It means the Japs are now split into two pockets, and only have their caves to protect them.  \n\nI can't see much more use for air support, as the remaining Japs are so spread out, and our men have to get in amongst them to clear them out.  I hear this is very hazardous work for the Marines.  Jap gunpowder is notorious because it doesn't flash, so a single Jap can hold back a platoon for hours before they get a bead on him.\n\nThe B-29's are coming in regularly now.  It's strange all the primitive fighting that's been going on in order to facilitate these technological wonders.\n\nBut are they going to end this war?  Or is it going to be the ordinary soldier with his rifle and bayonet?  A lot of men have sacrificed their lives to allow those planes to land here.  Those airmen are gonna have to do one hell of a job, to pay all those men back.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nWe're heading off today and handing all air operations over to the Army.  You've got one last mission to fulfil.\n\n47th FS and VMTB-242 are mounting a joint strike on the Bonins.  Escort them out to Ha Ha Jima, then re-join the fleet.\n\nYou men have done one hell of a job on Iwo, and we're all proud of you.  But this war isn't over yet; so make sure you come back safe, as soon we're gonna need your courage and experience more than we ever have before........\n\n
