Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 19th February 1945\n\nDOG, HOW-3\n\nIwo Jima sure looks a forbidding place from offshore.  Some reckon it looks like a giant sea monster, with Mount Suribachi, or "Hot Rocks" as we call it, as the head.  Others say it looks like a pork chop, but it's certainly the worst smelling pork chop I've ever come across.\n\nBlessman got hit last night by an enemy bomb.  Two of the UDT men were killed, and 20 were injured; and that after they'd got off the beaches almost unscathed yesterday.\n\nIt hits hard because those guys are just about the most respected men out here.  Even the toughest Marines tip their hat to them.  It's a bad omen as well - if even the most resourceful of us get unlucky, what's gonna happen to the rest of us?\n\n-------------------------------\n\n7th AF B-24's from the Marianas will be on their usual schedule to pepper the runways.  \n\nMaintain station around the island while the B-24's make their pass, and observe any positions that open up on the bombers.  Gamecock One will radio any identified positions to the ASCU.  \n\nThe rest of you may engage targets of opportunity that present themselves.  If the Japs poke their heads out to take a pot shot at you, send them back to the Hell where they belong.\n\nMake sure your strikes are precise and don't stray too low in order to engage your target.  All Naval fires will be low-ordinate for the period you are over the island, but any height below 400ft must be considered as at-risk.\n\nMay God go with you.\n\n
