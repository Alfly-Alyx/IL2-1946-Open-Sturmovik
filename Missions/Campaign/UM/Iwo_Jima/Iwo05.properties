Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 19th February 1945\n\nDOG, HOW+8\n\nThe Marines have had one hell of a first day on Iwo, and plenty of surprises with it.  Word is the first thing they did when they jumped off the LVT's is stick themselves into the fine volcanic sand.  The beach itself runs up to a sharp escarpment, and the boys with their 100lb packs just ran themselves into the ground trying to get up it.  Of course, when the Japs saw this they threw every thing they had at them.\n\nWe're also seeing plenty of mines.  Not on the beach itself, but on the exits from it.  Worse still, the sand over there is magnetic, which makes our detectors useless.  Fighting the Japanese is tough at the best of times, but when nature itself is against you, you know you've got a task in hand.\n\nThat said, we've got 30,000 men on the island, and in good order.  28th Marines have been successful in their drive to the West beaches, in order to cut the island in half.  The enemy still hold the high ground, so we're mighty vulnerable over there.  But we've successfully made the first step, and that lets us keep on going.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n1/24 and 2/25 have reported harassing artillery and mortar fire from the quarry facility to the Northeast of Airfield 1.  Forward observation haven't been able to fix a bearing, so they've called us up for an area strike.  You'll be armed with 500lb bombs, which are in short supply at this moment, so make sure you use them well.\n\nWhen you have delivered your ordnance, proceed to the Northeast and look out for snoopers and single raiders.  The enemy air response to our landings has so far been minimal, reflecting the success of our strikes on Honshu.  We are nevertheless picking up unidentified radar contacts, suggesting we still have bogeys in the vicinity.\n\n
