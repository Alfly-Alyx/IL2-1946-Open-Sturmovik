Name Strike Hill 362A
Short \n
Description USS Enterprise, Task Force 58.5, 1st March 1945\n\nDOG+9\n\nThe Seabees are progressing well with their preparatory work on Airfield 1.  They've been filling, scarifying, blading and rolling the main strip between the occasional bursts of enemy fire.\n\nWe've already had observation planes flying off it, and hopefully it won't be too long before the bigger stuff can land.\n\nThere's a bit more organisation behind the lines now, and a small degree of comfort.  The Marines have got a bakery, a shower facility and a post office.  They can even get fresh coffee in the morning.  These are good signs, but complacency can be dangerous.\n\nWe've even seen Marines out surfing.  Perhaps they've forgotten how close the enemy is.  That's hard for us to do, when the distance between friendly and enemy positons is literally measured in seconds.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n5th Div Marines on the left are being held up at Hill 362A, one of three peaks on this island with the same elevation.  They've called up a strike and requested Corps artillery to mark the target.  Your strike will be part of a co-ordinated fire from rocket trucks, with M4's following up as part of the assault.\n\nAfter your ordnance has been expended, you will turn on your tails in order to meet up with the PBY Seacats of Fleet Air Wing One (TG 50.5) at Waypoint 8.  Escort them to their new base on the lee side of Hot Rocks.\n\nFrom there they will be conducting Dumbo patrols and extending the current search sector closer to the Japanese mainland, in the period before Airfield 1 becomes fully operational.\n\n
