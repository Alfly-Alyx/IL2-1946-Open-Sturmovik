Name Dusk CAP, D-1
Short \n
Description USS Bennington, Task Force 58.1, 18th February 1945\n\nDOG-1\n\nI guess the odd thing about Iwo is that for once everybody understands the purpose of the objective.  \n\nIt's almost exactly half the way between our VLR bomber bases in the Marianas, and the Japanese homeland.  The Japs have been building it up as a signals platform from which they can track our B-29's on the way to the target, and an airbase from which they can intercept on their return.  If a ship gets damaged over Japan, the crew know they won't get much further home that Iwo.\n\nWe also know there are two functional strips on Iwo, and the enemy are busy building a third.  Our planners believe we can use these to launch escort fighters to assist the bombers over the target.  One of the runways may even be suitable to allow the landing of damaged Superforts if they can't make it all the way back.\n\nOnly trouble is we've got to capture it first.  And nobody believes the Japs are gonna give it to us on a plate.  Tokyo Rose has been saying that when the Marines leave the island, they'll be able to hold their roll-call in a phone booth.  Right now, there aren't too many takers on bets she ain't right.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nRight men, we're going to run our first CAP over the fleet.  We know from previous operations that the Japanese like to attack between dusk and dawn.  Look out for small formations and single raiders coming in at low altitude.  Our radar capabilities mean that this is the only chance they have of a successful attack.\n\nYou're taking the dusk shift.  By the time you get back, VFN's will be flying the pyjama run.\n\n
