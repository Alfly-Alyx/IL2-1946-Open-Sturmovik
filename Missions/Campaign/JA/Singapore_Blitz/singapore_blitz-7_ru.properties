Description February 8, 1942. \n\nThis morning at 8.30pm a first wave of 4,000 troops from the 5th and 18th Divisions moved in their vessels towards Singapore island. Our troops assaulted Sarimbun Beach, in the sector controlled by the Australian 22nd Brigade.\n\nThe final battle for Singapore has begun!!!!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nOnce again you will attack the Harbour Areas at Singapore, trying to stop the enemy from ferrying reinforcements to the north. \n\nThis operation will also serve as a diversion, preventing the enemy from making an all-out, last-ditch aerial effort against Sarimbun Beach.\n\nYes, you will have escort: Ki-27's.\n\nYou will probably notice that the AA fire has slackened somewhat. There are rumors inside Singapore that their AA ammo is running out! Great news, eh?\n
