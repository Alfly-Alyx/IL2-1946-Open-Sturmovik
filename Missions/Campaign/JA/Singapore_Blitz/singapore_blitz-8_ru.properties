Description Late afternoon, February 15, 1942. \n\nWe have broken through the last line of defence and the Allies are running out of food and some kinds of ammunition. The anti-aircraft guns has also run out of ammunition and are unable to repel any further air attacks by us, attacks that threatened to cause heavy casualties in the city centre.\n\nAn enemy deputation, in a motor car bearing a Union Jack and a white flag of truce, has come to our lines to discuss a cessation of hostilities. In a meeting in the Ford Motor Factory general Yamashita has laid down the terms of surrender.\n\nThe enemy formally surrendered shortly after 5.15pm. Our Rising Sun Flag has been hoisted over the Cathay Building, the tallest in Singapore, so that the psychological impact of the official surrender shall be maximised\n\nSingapore has fallen!!! \n\nThis is a monumental triumph for Japan! And the biggest military defeat suffered by the British EVER! \n\nYOUR MISSION\nEnemy ships are reportedly trying to escape from Singapore, in the direction of Sumatra. Your mission is to do a recce flight, and try and find some of these escaping ships. If possible, try to sink one of them!\n\nSPECIAL INTEL\nAccording to our sources, all remaining airworthy enemy planes have gone to Sumatra. Also, Singapore will soon be renamed to Syonan-to!\n\n***********************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the last mission in this campaign. Thanks for playing it and congratulations for completing it!\n/Peter K\n
