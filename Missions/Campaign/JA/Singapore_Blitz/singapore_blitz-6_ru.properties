Description February 1, 1942. \n\nYesterday the last organised Allied forces left Malaya proper, and retreated into Singapore. Allied engineers blew a 20 metre wide hole in the causeway that links Johore and Singapore, and they are obviously preparing a last stand there.\n\nRaiders and infiltrators from our forces, often disguised as Singaporean civilians, has already begun to cross the Straits of Johor in inflatable boats.\n\nAnd the Singapore Blitz continues!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe bosses wants to keep up a constant pressure on Singapore, not least because of psychological reasons. Therefore your Chutai will perform an attack in the cover of darkness. The target is Kallang Airfield, inside Singapore.\n\nOur commander think that the enemy fighters stay on the ground during the dark hours, and therefore he says you can make do without escort. Well, I'm not sure about that...\n\nGood luck!\n\nSPECIAL INTEL\nStrictly between us: our air war here in Malaya has been assisted by a spy, Patrick Heenan, a captain assigned to an Indian Army air liaison unit. \n\nHe was first stationed at Alor Star, in Kedah, northern Malaya, an area where most of the British RAF, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force squadrons in Malaya were based.\n\nWhen our forces invaded Thailand and Malaya on 8 December, our air raids were assisted by radio transmissions made by this Heenan. Among other espionage equipment, he had a morse code transmitter operated by an alphanumeric keyboard which was disguised as a typewriter.\n\nHe was only active the first days of the war, but then his transmissions suddenly stopped. Our sources inside Singapore says that he has been arrested and court-martialled.\n
