Description December 24, 1941. \n\nNice work on that attack on Kuala Lumpur airfield. The CO has his eyes on you, and thinks you are up for a medal!\n\nOur offensive in Malaya rolls on, unchecked by the enemy. This far we have mostly met Indian troops and other Colonial units, and they have mostly been defeated pretty easily. And on may locations, the enemy has simply withdrawn rather than putting up a real fight.\n\nWe suspect that they are concentrating the bulk of their forces to the south, and preparing a last stand at Singapore.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nOne of our recce airplanes have reported that some enemy aircraft have landed on an airstrip close to the front. Fly there and bomb the airstrip, and try and destroy as many of those aircraft that you can!\n\nSPECIAL INTEL\nWe are triumphant all around Southeast Asia! \n\nIt is obvious that British, Australian and Dutch forces, already drained of personnel and materiel by two years of war with Germany, and heavily committed in the Middle East, North Africa and elsewhere, are unable to provide much more than token resistance to our battle-hardened troops. \n\nThailand formally allied herself with Japan a couple of days ago, Hong Kong will fall any day now (perhaps tomorrow?) and the U.S. bases on Guam and Wake Island are also about to surrender. \n\nAlso our invasion of the Phillippines goes right on schedule: our main attack began two days ago as the 43.000 men of General Homma's 14th Army entered Luzon's Lingayen Gulf. The 48th Division and elements of the 16th Division, with support from artillery and 80 to 100 tanks, landed at three points along the east coast of the gulf. The Americans are hard pressed as well!\n
