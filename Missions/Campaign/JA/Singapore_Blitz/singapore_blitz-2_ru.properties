Description December 14, 1941. \n\nNice work. Now you have met the British fighters, they are - we believe - called Buffaloes. And they fly like it, right? But mind you, they have pretty heavy armament, so if you got one on your tail you ARE in trouble.\n\nAnyway: our offensive in Malaya rolls on, and is meeting with unexpected success! Now our right flank, moving along the west coast of Malaya, is also making good progress! Their next big target is Kuala Lumpur, and we have been asked to support them in their push.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday we will mount a big raid on the enemy airstrip at Kuala Lumpur, which we know is occupied by an Australian Buffalo unit, the 453 Squadron. \n\nIt is imperative that we gain control of the air. Without that control of the air we cannot win her in Malay. With it we WILL win.\n\nThis time we are sure that we will meet enemy fighters, so we will be escorted by fighters from Sentai 64, using that new fighter, the Hayabusa.\n\nSPECIAL INTEL\nWe have a slight advantage in numbers on the ground here in Malaya, and are significantly superior in close air support, armour, co-ordination, tactics and experience, with our units having fought in China. (The Allies appear to have no tanks at all!) Our bicycle infantry and light tanks allows for swift movement overland and also through terrain covered with tropical rainforest.\n
