Name        Singapore Blitz 
Description This is a semi-historical, 8-mission campaign, set in Malaya during the first months of the Pacific War\n\nYou are Japanese Bomber Pilot in Sentai 64, flying the Mitsubishi Ki-21 I. You will fly bomber missions during the drive south on Singapore, culminating in the battle for the big city in early 1942.\n\nRegarding Difficulty: I strongly recommend that you keep the 'No instant success' OFF - even if your mission may fail, the war still goes on, right? In addition to this I think that the "No Icons" option increases realism and playability a lot. Regarding rank: start as Tai-i.\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign requires mods!
