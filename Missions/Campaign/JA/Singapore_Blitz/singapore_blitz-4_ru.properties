Description January 15, 1942. \n\nOur forces have started to attack along the east coast of Malaya as well! \n\nYesterday afternoon troops from the Guards Division pushed across the Muar River, but were ambushed and were badly cut up, and also the bridge went up with a blast. The enemy party - probably Australians - having done a substantial slaughter, duly fell back in several groups that same evening and has now taken up a new position near Gemas.\n\nNow our aircraft has started attacking the enemy, and also the town of Gemas itself. And soon our troops, supported by tanks, will start attacking these new enemy lines.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYou are to bomb enemy positions in the Muar River area, more precisely some artillery positions in their rear, that is causing our forces a lot of problems.\n\nThere is a high probability of enemy fighters showing up, so you will be provided with a fighter escort.\n\nSPECIAL INTEL\nYour Chutai have now been transferred to a captured airstrip, down south, quite close to the front. As expected, the base is in a mess, but again the Brits, retreating in panic, have left us a lot of supplies and petrol. Another "Churchill airbase"! \n
