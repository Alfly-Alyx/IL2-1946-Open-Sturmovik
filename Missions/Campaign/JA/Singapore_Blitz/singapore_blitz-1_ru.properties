Description December 11, 1941. \n\nIt has begun! Japan is now at war with the Western Powers: USA, Britain and Holland!!!\n\nFour days ago our Naval Forces attacked the US Fleet laying at anchor at a big base in Hawaii, and inflicted enormous losses on them, surely paralyzing the Americans for a long time!\n\nAnd three days ago our forces started invading a number of strategic enemy locations all over Southeast Asia: Hong-Kong, the Philippines, Guam, Wake Island.\n\nAnd here in Malaya!\n\nWelcome to Sentai 12, Chutai 2! We have heard you did well at Bombing School. Now it's time to prove it.\n\nPreviously our troops landed at Kota Bharu, and secured this location, and now they've started advancing down the eastern coast of Malaya. This is made in conjunction with landings at Pattani and Songkhla in Thailand, where our troops have then proceeded south overland, across the Thailand-Malayan border, to attack the western portion of Malaya. \n\nTroops from the 25th Army (The Imperial Guards, and the 5th and 18th Divisions) have quickly surrounded a number of individual Indian units defending the coastline, and these isolated pockets have now started to surrender. \n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday your Shotai will follow the coast road to the south. Yor main target is a big road-block that the British have started building - blast it! Also several columns of retreating enemy forces are moving along this road. Strafe them!\n\nWe also want you to scout an important bridge to the south, check that it's still standing. Mind you: DON'T hit the bridges. Our advancing troops - several platoons of Ha-Go -tanks are already hot in pursuit - will need them! \n\nAs always: watch out for roving enemy planes. Sorry, we have no escort for you right now.\n \nSPECIAL INTEL\nFirst. Big news! The two main ships of the enemy fleet here in Malaya, the British battleship HMS Prince of Wales and battlecruiser HMS Repulse were both sunk yesterday! \n\nAmazingly, they did not have any aircraft cover. (This really illustrates the effectiveness of aerial attacks against naval forces.) The action took place east of Malaya, near Kuantan. Both the Prince of Wales and the Repulse were attacked by Navy land-based bombers and torpedo bombers. This means that Singapore has no real naval defense any longer!\n\nSecond. Our men have started to clean up this airfield, but it is still in quite a mess. The good news is that the Brits left the airfield in a panic, leaving lots of materiel and gasoline behind, for us to use. \n\nMore of our aircraft will soon be ferried here.\n
