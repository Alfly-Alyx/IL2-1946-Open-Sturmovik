Description January 22, 1942. \n\nMost of the enemy units defending the coastal positions have now been surrounded, forced to surrender, or have started a head-long reatreat towards the city. \n\nOur bicycle infantry and light tanks have won, despite the odds.\n\nNow the aerial onslaught on Singapore can begin in earnest!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYou are to attack one of the Harbour Areas in  Singapore. Watch out for those new enemy fighters, the heavily armed Hurricanes!\n\nSPECIAL INTEL\nAbout the enemy Hurricane: it is a British single-seat fighter mono-plane aircraft with retractable undercarriage. \n\nAlthough modern in most respects it employs the traditional construction techniques used on previous biplanes, with mechanically fastened, rather than welded joints. It has a girder-type fuselage of high-tensile steel tubes, over which sit frames and longerons that carried the doped linen fabric covering. The Hurricane's traditional construction means that the airframe is very durable, and more resistant to exploding cannon shells than faster and metal-skinned Spitfire. \n\nEven though the prestanda of the Spitfire is superior, with its ease of maintenance, widely set landing gear, VERY heavy armament and benign flying characteristics, the Hurricane has proved its worth. It is a very dangerous foe!\n\nSome data, mainly gleaned from our German Allies in Europe:\n\n    * Length: 9.84 m\n    * Wingspan: 12.19 m\n    * Maximum speed: some 540-550 km/h \n    * Powerplant: 1x Rolls-Royce Merlin V-12\n    * Range: 900+ km\n    * Service ceiling: Some 10,000 m\n    * Rate of climb: Unknown\n    * Guns: 8 (or 12!) 7.7 mm MG's\n
