Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 6th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\n\nOur ground troops are fighting at three fronts.\n\nThe eastern group made very good progress. It has reached Totore in the north and is advancing to the Collingwood Bay on it's southern side.\nIf the enemy isn't able to build up a substantial defense, a couple of enemy units will be cut off around Wanigela at the Collingwood Coast.\n\nIn the centre our forces are successful too.\nArapara was taken and now the Centre Group is advancing south to block the enemy's lines from Port Moresby to the Milne region.\n\nBut our advance aiming on Port Moresby is about to fail.\nThe enemy air landing at Wairopi made any attempt to advance to Loribaiwa impossible. \nIt's clear that the Allies concentrated their efforts on the holding of Etogi and Naura.\nAllthough numerous attacks were conducted onto the two villages, it was impossible to take them. \nOur ground units suffered horrible losses in front of the enemy's positions.\nThe enemy airborne troops west of Wairopi are blocking our one and only supply route to Etogi and our heavy forces are marching back to handle the enemy airbornes.\nWithout these forces any further attempt to take Etogi is senseless.\nAn enemy attack from Yodda onto Kokoda could be stopped with the use of our reserves.\n\nAllthough the overall situation seems to be promising at the first look on the map, our main target, Port Moresby, is far from beeing taken.\n\nThe enemy will have to pay a high price: \nThe destruction of his airborne group. \nBut we will have to pay our price in time. \nTime we would have needed to reach Port Moresby before the enemy could reinforce his position.\n\n\nOur weak and only light forces at Etogi are attacked by enemy bombers\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep.\n\nTime: 07:04\nAltitude: 2000m\nFlight: Sendai- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
