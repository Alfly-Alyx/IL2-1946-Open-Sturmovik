Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nOctober 3rd, 1942\n\n==================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nFor the most time the bad weather holds the planes on the ground.\n\nThe rain period has begun.\n\nThis will last until about january.\nTime for supplying and reinforcements.\nTime for refreshment after weeks of terror and exhaustion.\nYou're still alive.\nSo many are not.\n\nYou came to New Guinea with a squadron of 25 planes and 31 pilots.  23 planes were lost in these five weeks. In this time 19 new planes were delivered as reinforcements. 19 airmen died or are missing and the squadron recieved 17 new pilots.\nFrom your comrades from August only five are still with you.\n\nWithout permanent reinforcements in men and material your squad wouldn't be operational.\nLosses of this degree had to be suffered by all air units here in New Guinea.\nAnd it's not very satisfying that your opponent had to suffer equal losses.\nWill you ever come home again?\n\nThe war on the ground is going on. \nBad weather or not.\nOur forces have started an offensive to take away the whole centre of Eastern New Guinea.\nTwo main thrusts are beeing conducted:\nOur western attack group is advancing  along the road Kalikodobu - Abau and our eastern attack group is attacking along the Embeso - Abau- Road.\n\nThe enemy is retreating. It seems that he doesn't have the forces on hand he would need to stop our ground troop's advance.\n\nThis all has to happen without air support.\nThe strong winds and the bad visibility makes it impossible to identify and to hit enemy ground units.\nAt these conditions nothing more than bomber attacks at medium to high altitude are possible.\nSo the fighter units will have to conduct high altitude patrols during the rain period.\n\nYou didn't fly since two days.\nYou and your comrades were sitting in the casino when suddenly you were called to your planes.\n\nEnemy low flying bombers on the way to Buna! \nOutside a thunderstorm is raging...\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nIntercept the enemy bombers.\n\nTime: 18:49\nAltitude: 2000m\nFlight: Sendai- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nThunderstorm. bad visibility. Stormy.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
