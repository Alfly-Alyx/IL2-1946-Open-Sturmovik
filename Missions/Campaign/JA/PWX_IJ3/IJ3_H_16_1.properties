Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 2nd, 1942\n\n==================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nTwo days of rain hindered flight operations.\nThe airwar made a pause.\n\nOn the ground these days were the time of the infantry.\n\nIn the western sector of the front our forces finally took Alola and pressed forward to Etogi.\nOn both sides of the village our troops bypassed the American strongpoint and reached the flanks of Naura. The enemy is holding the road between Naura and Etogi. Now we have the opportunity to cut his Etogi garrison off.\nThe fights are difficult as the supplies have to be brought up to the Naura flanks through the dense forest. This way no heavy weapons can be brought up.\n\nIn the centre of the front Laruni was taken.\nOur forces are now advancing to the American's next strong position Arapara.\n\nIn the northeast the Americans managed to build up a surprisingly strong defense line in front of Totore. \n\nSince the night the weather is clearing up.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep\n\nTime: 06:00\nAltitude: 2400m\nFlight: Sendai- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny. Light haze. Fresh winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
