Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 11th, 1942\n\n==================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe forthgoing of the Eastern New Guinea Campaign is a twofold sword:\n\nAt the moment it's impossible to takePort Moresby. \nThe enemy's air landing turned the tide. \nIt's no longer possible to bring down the enemy at the Etogi- Naura sector.\nOur reconnaissance reports that the Americans are getting reinforcements and supplies from a ship convoy which reached Port Moresby during the night.\n\nAttacks on the enemy's airfields failed to destroy the enemy air power. Our losses were at least equal to the destructions on installations and planes. The same happened when the enemy attacked our airfields in return: Their losses were higher than their achievements.\n\nNow our main efforts are concentrated onto the other three targets:\nFirst, the enemy airborne pocket at Wairopi will be erased soon to reopen the supply route to the Etogi- Naura sector. There the troops are about to prepair themselves for an anticipated enemy counter attack.\n\nOur advance in the centre is making good progress. To defend the Naura front sector the enemy has withdrawn forces from this sector. It is hped to reach the coast in a few days.\n\nIn the east our forces have reached the Collingwood Bay and cut off an enemy force of brigade size.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep.\n\nTime: 10:28\nAltitude: 2000m\nFlight: Sendai- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSlowly clearing up, still fresh winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
