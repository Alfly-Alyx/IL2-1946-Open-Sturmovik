Description Negros, September 22 1944.\n\nWe got about a weeks respite, when we could gather our strength, and repair some of our unservicable aircraft. (As always we lack good ground crews.) \n\nBut now the US Carrier aircraft are back.\n\nThis time they are swarming, not over Negros, but over the main island, Luzon. Yesterday there were furious air clashes around Manila. The Ki-61 units there really had to fight for their lives.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday 22nd Hikodan in Manila has requested help from us. \n\nTherefore we will perform a big fighter sweep due north, up towards Luzon, and see if we can take some pressure from the hard-pressed Sentais there.\n\nMind you: this will be a long haul.\n
