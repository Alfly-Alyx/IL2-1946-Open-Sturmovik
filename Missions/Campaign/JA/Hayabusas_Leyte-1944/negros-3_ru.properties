Description Negros, north of Mindanao, September 13 1944.\n\nAfternoon. \n\nWell, that was a tough mission this morning. We aren't really equipped, or trained, for anti-shipping duties. Best to leave this to the Navy boys.\n\nWe thought that the American Carriers were running away now, as usual after doing a hit-and-run, but the enemy air attacks continue. We have now just received reports about enemy aircraft attacking in the Visayas area.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nGo up at once, and see if you can catch the enemy aircraft. And this time form up properly!\n\nHISTORICAL NOTE\nFour bomb-laden Ki-43's set out in dawn September 13. Only one aircraft did return, piloted by 1st Lt Katsumi, and he claimed to have hit a US cruiser.\n
