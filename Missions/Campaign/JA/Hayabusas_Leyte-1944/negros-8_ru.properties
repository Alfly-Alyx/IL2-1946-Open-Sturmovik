Description Negros, October 23 1944.\n\nThere are rumors that a big naval battle has started. At the same time several attempts have been made to neutralise the enemy airfield at Tacloban, using Ta Dan phosphorous bombs, but the success has been mixed. Also, the losses suffered by our forces have been big.\n\nThe enemy pressure on our airfields here at Negros is steadily increasing, and we have very few fighters left. Our Sentai have only three airworthy Hayabusas left. And our base has been torn to pieces. This has been very tough, comparable to the green hell of New Guinea.\n\nFor the first time many have started to wonder if we will win this war... But no one says it aloud.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nScramble, scramble! Enemy fighter-bombers are approaching again. Get airborne and meet them!\n\nHISTORICAL NOTE\nOn November 1, 1944, the combat in the Philippines was over for Sentai 30, and the unit was ordered back to Japan to rebuild. The Ki-43 they still had left were left behind for Sentai 31 to use.\n\nAt the same time the Battle of Leyte Gulf was fought, the largest naval battle in history. It was a series of four distinct engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte from October 23 to October 26, 1944, and was a signal US victory.\n\nThe battle secured the beachheads of the U.S. Sixth Army on Leyte against attack from the sea and broke the back of Japanese naval power. \n\nThe U.S. Sixth Army soon continued its advance from the east, as the Japanese rushed reinforcements to the Ormoc Bay area on the western side of the island. While the Sixth Army was reinforced successfully, the U.S. Fifth Air Force was able to devastate the Japanese attempts to resupply. \n\nIn torrential rains and over difficult terrain, the advance continued across Leyte and the neighboring island of Samar to the north. \n\nOn December 7, U.S. Army units landed at Ormoc Bay and, after a major land and air battle, cut off the Japanese ability to reinforce and supply Leyte. Although fierce fighting continued on Leyte for months, the U.S. Army was in control. \n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the final mission in this campaign. Thanks for playing it and congratulations for completing it - it's a tough one!\n\nA special thanks to Delvpier for the HUGE Philippines map, and to Billfish, for the Ki-43 skins.\n\n/Peter K\n
