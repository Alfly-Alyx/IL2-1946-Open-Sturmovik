Description Negros, October 22 1944.\n\nWe don't know what effect that bomber attack against the US bridgehead at Leyte had, but we must keep on trying, hold out! Remember Bushido virtue No. 7, "Devotion and Loyalty", which is the foundation of all the other virtues.\n\nAlso: by keeping up the pressure on the American bridgehead, we will distract them from that BIG offensive operation that the Navy is planning, and that will start any day now. \n\nSo even if we don't crush that bridgehead right now, it is imperative that we keep it busy!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nScramble, scramble! Enemy aircraft has been spotted, heading directly towards us! Get airborne and try to stop them! \n
