Description Negros, October 21 1944.\n\nI'm surprised to see that you are still alive. That was a horrible mission! We've lost most of our aircraft and pilots by now. This can't go on for much longer.\n\nThe US forces on the east side of Leyte have started to push inland. Worse than that, we have reports of the American working frantically on getting the airstrip at Tacloban ready for action. They seem to have flown in some planes already.\n\nBut very soon our Naval Forces will start their big, three-pronged attack on the American Landing Forces, Operation Sho! \n\nMeanwhile, more reinforcements are being rushed to this critical spot.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAt dawn some of our heavy bombers are going to attack vessels off Leyte. \n\nThis time you won't have to fly burdened with bombs. Your task is instead to escort those bombers, and help them getting through the enemy fighter screen. In this you will cooperate with some Ki-61's.\n\nRendez-vous over Cebu.\n\nGood luck!\n
