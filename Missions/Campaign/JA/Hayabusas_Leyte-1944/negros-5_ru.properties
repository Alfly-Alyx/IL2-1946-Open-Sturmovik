Description Negros, October 20 1944.\n\nThe Battle for the Philippines has begun in earnest! \n\nFollowing four hours of heavy naval gunfire US forces landed around 10:00 this morning on beaches at the east side of the big island of Leyte, northeast of Cebu. \n\nAmerican units are pushing ashore around the Palo River, and it is obvious that they want to take the airstrip at Tacloban. As mentioned before: they are not in range of their land base air units here, and in order to reach parity and surpass us in the air, they MUST take an airfield, so that they can base planes on the ground.\n\nAlready they have secured beachheads deep enough to receive heavy vehicles and large amounts of supplies. \n\nThere are rumors that some well-known American general has already waded ashore, holding an emotional radio speech about returning or some such! But just wait: our troops on the ground will evict him once more...\n\nReinforcements from Luzon have started to arrive. And more are on the way. Some as far off as Japan. Another rumor has it, that a new Japanese superfighter is soon to be deployed here.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe have been ordered to attack the US shipping off the Leyte beachhead at once. And we are using most of our serviceable aircraft (which isn't much) in this strike, and Sentai 31 will join in on the way.\n\nWe must do what we can, even to the point of sacrifice...\n\nThis will be tough. Expect a screen of enemy fighters that you must punch through. And once through the AA fire will be horrible.\n\nGood luck. I hope that I will see you again.\n
