Name        Haybusas over Leyte, 1944 
Description The date is September 1944. The place is the Philippines, the island of Negros.\n\nYou are a Japanese fighter pilot in Sentai 30, flying the nimble but undergunned and underprotected Ki-43 Hayabusa. Since the Japanese Navy lost the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June, the situation in this part of the Pacific has suddenly become critical. No one knows if the Americans in this situation are going for Formosa or the Philippines, but Sentai 30 has been sent south to bolster the defence, just in case.\n\nRegarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option. Also if you feel confident enough choose the "No Map Icons" option as well. It will give a MUCH more intense game. Regarding rank: start as "Sho-sai".\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have A.) The AAA Mod installed, B.) The map over Philippines made by Delvpier. This campaign is hereby dedicated to him, with thanks for his work on this huge map.
