Description Negros, north of Mindanao, September 12 1944.\n\nWhen our Navy lost the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June, the situation in this part of the Pacific suddenly became critical.\n\nWe don't know yet if they are going for Formosa or the Philippines, but in preparation for this last threat, we in the Sentai 30, together with Sentai 31 (together forming the 13th Hikodan) were sent here in July. \n\nBoth Sentais are equipped with the latest mark of the Ki-43, the Ki-43-II Kai. \n\nWe were first based on Luzon, but were shifted south, to the island of Negros, in August.\n\nYou are of course fully aware of the vital strategic importance of the Philipines for us. \n\nNot only is it an important source of supplies in itself, especially rubber, but it also commands the strategic sea routes to Borneo and Sumatra by which petroleum is brought to Japan. We lost New Guinea, and that was quite a blow, but we must NOT lose the Phillipines.\n\nAs the Phillippines lies outside the range of all land-based enemy planes, initially they can only attack us with carrier-based aircraft. This will hopefully mean that we will at least have numerical parity - but one never knows with the Americans: their supplies of men and especially materiel seems to be endless...\n\nJuly and August was eventless, spent on boring patrols. \n\nYOUR MISSION\nBut now the balloon is up!!!\n\nWe have received reports from several of our air warning pickets at different islands (our radar isn't too good) that have spotted enemy Carrier planes, on the prowl.\n\nScramble, and see if you can find them! \n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1. The missions are based on history. The dates and general circumstances are correct.\n\n2. To simulate the fact that Sentai 30 had to fight against very hard odds indeed, you are considered to have completed a mission by just landing in one piece at the airstrip.\n\n3. If you want to fly in the same camo as your wingmen, don't forget to switch skin!\n
