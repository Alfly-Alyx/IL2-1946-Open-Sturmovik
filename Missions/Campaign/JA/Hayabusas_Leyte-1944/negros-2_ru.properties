Description Negros, north of Mindanao, September 13 1944.\n\nThat first clash with the Americans was nasty. Both their numbers and the quality of their machines was an unhealthy surprise. And this was our first real fight since we were formed in July last year.\n\nThere were several aerial attacks in this area during the last day. A Flying Training Hiokotai based at La Carlota got jumped during a training session, and 12 Ki-27's were shot down...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThere is obviously a US carrier on the prowl northeast of Samar. Judging from their past behaviour, they are now steaming out of the area, after doing this hit and run.\n\nYour mission is to load your aircraft with bombs and go out with your shotai, and see if you can find that US carrier. And if you do: attack it!\n
