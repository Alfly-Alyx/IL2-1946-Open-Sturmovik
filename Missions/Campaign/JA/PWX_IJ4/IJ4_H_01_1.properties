You and the half of your comrades. \nYou knew that you wouldn't like the sea.\nThat's why you enlisted to the Army Air Force and not the Navy Air Arm.\n\nAnd now?\nYour first days of war began on a ship.\nOn board of a carrier which brings you to New Guinea.\n\nOur Army landed on Eastern New Guinea on March 8th.\nAt Buna. A small christian mission on the north coast of Eastern New Guinea.\n\nNow our forces are attacking into three directions simultaneously:\n\nThe strongest, western group is attacking on the shortest way from Buna to the southwest, into the direction of Port Moresby itself.\nHere our Army has reached the village of Wairopi in the night. Hard fights are raging around the small spot. The important road crossing at Kokoda and Alola is in danger and with it the only road connection to the northwest.\nPort Moresby would be cut off from the only landway to the west of New Guinea.\n\nThe second, central Japanese group is advancing south, along the road Natungo- Jaure. The village of Jaure is short to be reached.\nFollowing this road to the south coast, the Japanese could cut of Port Moresby from the Milne Region.\n\nOur Army's third advance is moving along the northern coast to the east. This group is meeting only weak resistance.\n\n\nIn the air the enemy had quickly supported his forces by additional fighter units.\nNow both side's air forces are roughly equal in strength.\nThe operational airspace is very limited in size. Bombers have a hard stand. \nYou don't have to wait very long to meet the enemy.\nLosses are high on both sides.\n\nHere you will start your war career.\n\nBut first you have to reach your new assignment:\nBuna fighter base No. 2\n\nYou're seasick. The waves are high. The carrier is dancing up and down, left to right.\n\nTake off from it and fly to land.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nTransfer to Buna Air Base No. 2\n\nTime: 07:00\nAltitude: 3000m\nFlight: Honshu- 3\n\nWeather Forecast:\nOvercast. Stormy.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
