Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nTarawa Atoll...... \n\nJune 2nd, 1943\n\n=================================\n\nSITUATIONAL REPORT:\n\nThe Hiryu Group is just arriving at Tarawa.\n\nIn the afternoon all squadron leaders were called to a briefing.\n\nInformations gathered during the last times, from different sources are strongly indicating that the US Navy is running a major operation against Tarawa.\n\n1.) Since the mid of May strong enemy submarine activity could be detected around Tarawa.\nOn several occasions enemy submarines were sighted and / or attacked. At least three different submarines were identified. But it must be estimated, that more than three subs were involved in the enemy reconaissance operation around Tarawa.\n\n2.) At the 28th the enemy tried to land a commando troop directly on one of our islands. This ended in a total loss of the enemy submarine and it's crew.\nThree men were saved and interrogated.\nThe commando troop had the order to build up a hidden observation point until mid of June.\n\n3.) On the 29th two of our submarines made independently contact with an enemy capital ship force. One of them reported the sighting of one enemy aircraft carrier and one battleship.\nOne of the subs is estimated to be sunk.\n\n4.) Yesterday one of our reconaissance planes reported the sighting of enemy fighting ships about 1000 miles east-north-east of Tarawa. The reconaissance plane is missed too.\n\nCalculating the different positions of the sightings, the enemy ships could reach our Atoll in the night to the 4th.\n\nThe attacking of Tarawa would be a logical step for the enemy strategy because Betio Airbase is a main threat to the enemy supply lines from Hawaii to the New Guinea Front.\n\nEstimated that the enemy force arrives here on the 4th, the Taiho Carrier Group could be here in time. It was ordered to steam at top speed to Tarawa yesterday.\n\nRear Admiral Yoshida is awaited at Betio HQ for an operational meeting with our commander, Rear Admiral Izao Suzuki, to work on a defense plan.\n\nYou're ordered to escort his flight to Betio Island Airbase.\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nFly to the Hiryu. Wait until the B5N of Rear Admiral Yoshida takes off and escort him to Betio.\n\nTime: 18:04\nAltitude:  300m\nFlight: Katana- 1\n\nWeather forecast:\nSunny evening. Fresh winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
