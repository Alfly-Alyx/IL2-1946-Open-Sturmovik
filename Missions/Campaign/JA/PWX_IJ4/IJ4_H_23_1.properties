Otherwise the heavy forces have to be drawn back to the Wairopi area before Naura could be taken.\nThis would cost many time which the Americans could use to strengthen their defense at Naura.\n\nThe situation is critical.\nAttacks on Etogi are ordered to break off the enemy defense line.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep at Etogi.\n\nTime: 05:50\nAltitude: 2500m\nFlight: Honshu- 3\n\nWeather Forecast:\nClearing up, light winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
