Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nDecember 7th, 1942\n\n================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe enemy attacks on our radar installations failed. \nWe were well prepaired. \nMany enemy bombers were shot down.\nAllthough we had some losses too, the defense of the radar was a success.\n\nBut you can't really enjoy the victory.\nThe overall situation here at New Guinea is horrible.\nThe bad weather has become a second enemy.\n\nIf pilots have to bail out, they're usually far from beeing saved. The high trees are dangerous landing ground for men hanging at their chute. \nIt's a matter of luck if the pilot makes it to the ground alive. Many have died hanging in a tree.\nMany are missed.\nEven if the man makes it to the ground unharmed, he has to find his way home, through a dangerous jungle, through well hidden enemy lines.\n\n\nFrom time to time the enemy front troops around Collingwood are recieving supplies by ship transport. So today.\nIt's clear that the high command wants them to be attacked.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nEscort the B5Ns to the Collingwood Bay and attack enemy vessels with bombs.\n\nTime: 14:30\nAltitude: 300m\nFlight: Katana- 3\n\nWeather Forecast:\nRain, of course. Bad conditions.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
