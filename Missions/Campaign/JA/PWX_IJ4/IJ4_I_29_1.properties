Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nJanuary 20th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nYesterday was a very important day for our war in Eastern New Guinea.\n\nSince two days the enemy was attacking our defense line at Alola.\nMore than once the enemy was close of breaking through our line.\nSince the same time Goodenough had come under heavy enemy air raids.\n\nThese enemy offensive actions lead our command to the belief, that a major enemy offensive against Goodenough and Alola were coming.\n\nWith the first enemy attack at Alola, two days ago, our troops at Arapara were ordered to prepair for a limited attack in direction of Rouna.\n\nYesterday, in the early morning, an enemy battleship group started a bombardment of Goodenough Airfield.\nImmediately Admiral Okumura ordered all operational planes to take off to transfer to Buna.\nA part of the planes were ordered to attack the enemy ships.\nRight in the first 30 minutes nearly 50 planes, approximately the half, succeeded in getting out and quickly one destroyer was sunk and two of the enemy battleships were damaged.\n\nWith the first light, the enemy withdraw his ships from Goodenough, although the runways were still fairly usable. \nA mistake, our luck.\n\nAt the same time two other important things happened:\n\nAt Alola, the enemy launched a very serious attack to penetrate our defense line. The battle stood at it's high peak, when suddenly the assault was broken off.\n\nWhat did happen?\n\nOur Arapara Group had launched it's attack at the same time the Americans attacked at Alola.\n\nThis Arapara Group attack was a great success.\nWithin three hours the Group managed to break deep into the enemy line. The first enemy hill chain fell within the first 90 minutes.  It's clear that the enemy defense line was thinned out to favour their operation at Alola.\n\nNow the enemy had to decide between two unfavourable options:\nTo take Alola for the loss of Rouna, or to save Rouna for the giving up of the Alola assault.\n\nThe enemy decided to transfer a part of his heavy forces to Rouna to hold on the advance of the Arapara Group.\n\nDuring the time all this happened, the enemy battleships were attacked three times.\nOne of the air raids succeeded in making one of the battleships immobile.\nIn the following hour this ship was sunk and the other ships were attacked two further times.\nAnother attack damaged a second battleship so serious, that a big fire could be observed.\nBut it looked that the two left battleships would be able to get out.\n\nSuddenly, at around 11:00 our Cape Milne commando unit reported a big ship, lying immobile and burning at the south beach of the Milne Cape.\n\nA quickly called air raid succeeded in sinking the second enemy battleship.\n\nIn the afternoon the enemy managed to stiffen his resistance at Alola, clearly with the help of tanks brought on from Alola.\n\nNormally one could say that we achieved a great victory yesterday, but it had to be paid with great losses.\nAt Goodenough, over 40 planes were destroyed by the enemy ship bombardment. Another 37 planes were lost during the attacks on the vessels.\nAt Alola the early enemy assault cost us nearly 2250 men dead, missed or wounded and our Arapara Group lost 1700 men during it's attack.\nAllthough the enemy had great losses too our future plans are affected by these circumstances.\n\nAn Army Air Force Command Meeting shall be held this evening. Together with your leader you are ordered to be there at 18:30.\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFly to Buna Airfield.\n\nTime: 17:50\nAltitude: low\nFlight: Katana- 3\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunrise.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
