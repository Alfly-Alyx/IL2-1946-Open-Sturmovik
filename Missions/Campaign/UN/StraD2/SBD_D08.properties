Short SBD Campaign SBD_D08 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 18, 1943\nTime: 0900\nWeather: Poor\nTemperature: 14F\nClouds: 4,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 12 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 3 x 250 pound bombs\nFuel: 35%\nTarget: Airfield\nTarget location: BC/18\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nYou should all be able to figure out where we are headed today.  Enemy air activity has been very high the last few days.  Its time we took out that airfield for good.  Lt. Commander Culley has ordered every airworthy dive-bomber in the squadron into the air for today's raid.  Fly a course of 210 degrees.  Flight 1 will hit any targets of opportunity in the center of the airfield.  Flight 2 will target the western end of the field, and flight 3 the eastern end.  Leave nothing intact gentlemen!\n\nThe nips will probably be expecting us.  You are to hit that base with everything we have.  We must put that base out of action!  You are not to turn back for any reason!  \n\nI want everyone to be focused on the mission today.  Don't worry about the wife and kids.  Don't worry about your girlfriends.  Don't think about anything except your aircraft, your gunner and the target! \n\nTo make sure everyone is focused on the mission, I have asked Father Dooley to be available for confessions in the chapel until 0630 today.  For those who haven't made out a final will and testament, Major Prikkel of the JAG Corps will be in his office for the next several hours.  His office is conveniently located just outside the officer's mess; just in case you need a reference point Ensign Parker.\n\nToday's bad news is that we have received official word that the Arctic Tern will not be replaced.  CINCPAC doesn't have a destroyer to send us that is outfitted for arctic conditions.  So until this tour is over, we will only have the Northern Fox as an escort.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Airfield\n
