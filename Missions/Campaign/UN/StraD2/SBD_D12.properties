It's hard to imagine how he confused a Betty for a B-25.  \n\nWe did find the B-25.  It's in sector AE/24.  We're certain the crew didn't survive the crash landing.  Locate and destroy the B-25 before the Nips get to it and find our top-secret camera.\n\nFly 285 degrees.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach sector AE/24\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the downed aircraft\n
