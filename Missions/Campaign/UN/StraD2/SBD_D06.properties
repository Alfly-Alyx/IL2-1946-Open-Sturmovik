Name SBD_D06
Short SBD Campaign SBD_D06 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 14, 1943\nTime: 0903\nWeather: Snow\nTemperature: 25F\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 1 x 500 pound bomb\nFuel: 50%\nTarget: Icebound freighters\nTarget location: AX/18\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 4,500 feet\n\nAs promised, we are returning to destroy the freighters now that the Takei is out of the picture.  The freighters and the patrol craft are icebound and are sitting ducks.  Flight 1 (your flight) will target the northern freighter.  Flight 2 will target the southern freighter.\n\nI need to point out that not everything is going our way this morning.  Hopefully, one or two of you has left the officer's mess long enough to notice its snowing.  Visibility is crap!  As a result, you will only climb to 4,500 feet to make your attack.  Any higher and you won't be able to see the enemy.  You may even have trouble at that altitude.  Adjust your attack accordingly.  Fly 200 degrees to reach the freighters.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the freighters\n
