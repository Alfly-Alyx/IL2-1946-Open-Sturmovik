Short SBD Campaign SBD_D05 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 13, 1943\nTime: 1519\nWeather: Clear\nTemperature: 3F\nClouds: 3,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 1 x 500 pound bomb\nFuel: 50%\nTarget: IJN Icebreaker Takei\nTarget location: AX/18\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\n\nFirst of all, I'm tired of being asked why the maps are all in Russian and if we are fightin' for the commies.  We are not fightin' for the commies, this territory belongs to the good ole USA.  The reason the maps are in Russkie is that this territory used to be owned by them, but the USA bought it in 1867.  We all know how fast Washington works, 76 years hasn't been enough time to print new maps.  So get used to it!!!\n\nThe early afternoon recon flight spotted an armed icebreaker making its way through the Dalle Icefields.  They are heading toward the Japanese airfield.  The icebreaker was leading several supply ships and a small patrol boat.  Obviously, if we disable that icebreaker, the resupply effort will be stopped dead in its tracks.  We will return for the freighters later, concentrate all firepower on the icebreaker.\n\nI want to warn you idiots that the icebreaker has been positively identified as the IJN Takei.  She is heavily armed, so this won't be an easy mission.  AAA from the Takei and the patrol boat will be heavy.\n\nThe good news is that recon flights over the airfield still show it still out of action for the most part.  The Japanese have a few planes that are combat ready, but not enough to seriously interfere with the mission.  However, if that icebreaker gets through the situation around here will change drastically.  Fly 210 degrees to reach the target.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Sink the Takei\n
