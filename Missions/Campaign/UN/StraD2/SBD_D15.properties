Short SBD Campaign SBD_D15 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 18, 1943\nTime: 0715\nWeather: Clear\nTemperature: 14F\nClouds: 4,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 12 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 3 x 250 pound bombs\nFuel: 35%\nTarget: Evacuation convoy\nTarget location: BD/18\nDistance to target: 35 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nEnsign Parker's recon flight this morning found that the Japanese abandoned the airfield overnight and are evacuating by sea.  Two cargo/troop ships are being escorted out of the area by two destroyers.\n\nWe have decided to say goodbye in proper US Navy fashion - a dozen SBD's with three 250 pound bombs each!  Flights 1 and 2 take out the lead troop ship.  Flights 3 and 4 target the second troop ship.  Fly 105 degrees to reach the target.\n\nEnsign Parker has also reported that the enemy has set fire to everything they couldn't take with them.  Apparently, its quite a bonfire.  You have permission to overfly the abandoned airfield and the embarkation beach (south of the airfield) on your return.\n\nBe careful out there, we are headed back to Pearl as soon as the last plane lands.  We want to bring everyone home.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach sector BD/18\nSecondary Objective: Evacuation convoy\n
