Description February 3, 1943\nTime: 1052\nWeather: Snow\nTemperature: 20F\nClouds: 4,500 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 3 x 250 pound bombs\nFuel: 35%\nTarget: Airfield\nTarget location: BC/18\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 12,000 feet\n\nYour squadron has been assigned to the Polar Viper for your next tour of duty.  The Polar Viper is a Casablanca-class carrier which has been heavily modified for arctic operations.  Her bow has been strengthened to handle ice up to eight inches thick, she carries 50% more fuel than a standard escort carrier, and all her external gear will function down to 30 below zero.\n\nLike her namesake, she is small, tough, deadly and hard to find.  The real polar viper has been known to kill polar bears with a single strike.  We expect that this viper will prove to be as deadly and elusive to the Japanese.\n\nThe Army Air Force airfield in sector AK/20 was hit hard by Japanese medium bombers two days ago.  Fortunately, the poor weather has prevented a second strike from the Japanese.  If they launch a second strike before the army airfield can rebuild its defenses, it will likely be destroyed beyond repair and have to be abandoned.\n\nYour mission is to hit the Japanese airfield before they can launch that second strike and disable it.  Target the Betty bombers if possible.  They should be on the big parking area on the eastern edge of the field.  You are to drop your bombs and then return to base - no strafing is authorized on this mission.  The AAA is expected to be heavy and you don't have much fuel to spare if you get a fuel leak.  \n\nTakeoff and fly course 210 to get to the enemy airfield.  The Japs will be expecting a low-level B-25 attack from the west, so you have a good chance of hitting them undetected; assuming you can find their base in this awful weather.  Look for the airfield through breaks in the clouds, you might get lucky and spot it.\n\nTo save weight we have reduced the fuel you are carrying to 35%.  The Polar Viper's top speed is only about 18 knots.  With 750 pounds of bombs you can't take a full fuel load and get off this short deck.  Even with the minimal fuel you will be barely hitting 80 knots when you reach the end of the deck.  Be damn careful!\n\nGentlemen, you will notice that most of the map is shown as being under enemy control.  This is not entirely true.  Some of this area is controlled by the Japanese, but most of it is under the control of Mother Nature, and she doesn't like visitors.  Bail out or crash over enemy territory and you will die.  Bail out or crash over the water and you will die.  Bail out or crash more than a few miles from the Army base and you will die.  Any questions?\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the bombers\n
