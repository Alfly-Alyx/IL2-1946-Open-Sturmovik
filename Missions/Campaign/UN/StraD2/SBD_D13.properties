Short SBD Campaign SBD_D13 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 24, 1943\nTime: 0232\nWeather: Hazy\nTemperature: 30F\nClouds: 4,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 4 x SBD-3 and 4 x P-40C\nLoadout: none\nFuel: 60%\nTarget: Recon\nTarget location: AQ/21, AR/21, AT/20, AU/20, AV/19 and AU/18\nAltitude: 3,500 feet\n\nThe seaplane that you ran into yesterday, has to have a support ship nearby.  We need to find that ship before they launch an attack against us.\n\nWe are launching four SBDs to conduct a search of all inland waterways.  We think the seaplane tender is stationed in one of these channels.\n\nWhile on patrol, avoid engaging enemy aircraft if possible, as you will not have an escort.  If you come under attack, call for help from the P-40's on patrol near the airfield.  \n\nIf you spot the enemy seaplane tender, do not approach or engage it.  Return to the ship immediately and we will prepare a strike.  \n\nTake a good look at your route; it's rather complicated.  We are running you along the coast in a number of sectors as we think that's where the tender is hiding along the coast.  \n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the first recon sector\nSecondary Objective: Six additional recon waypoints\n
