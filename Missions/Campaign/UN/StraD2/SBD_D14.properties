Name SBD_D14
Short SBD Campaign SBD_D14 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 24, 1943\nTime: 1026\nWeather: Good\nTemperature: 30F\nClouds: 4,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x P-40E\nLoadout: 3 x 250\nFuel: 35%\nTarget: Seaplane tender\nTarget location: AU/18\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nNow that we know where the seaplane tender is, we are going to sink it.  She is probably anchored someweher near the area she was spotted.  We don't know precisely where, but she must still be in sector AU/18 or very close by.  Finding out that she has a destroyer escort wasn't the best news, but we can't expect to get every target handed to us on a silver platter.\n\nFlight 2 will take the lead on this mission and will target the destroyer.  Flight 1 will follow and destroy the seaplane tender and any seaplanes nearby.  She is probably loaded with aviation fuel, so pull out of your dive with plenty of altitude to spare.\n\nIf the destroyer is not sunk by flight 2, you do not have permission to stick around to strafe the area.  Return to the ship immediately after the attack if the situation dictates it.\n\nFly 120 degrees to reach sector AU/18. \n\nPrimary Objective: Reach sector AU/18\nSecondary Objective: Sink the seaplane tender\n
