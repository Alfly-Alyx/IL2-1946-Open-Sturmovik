Short SBD Campaign SBD_D04 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 12, 1943\nTime: 1107\nWeather: Clear\nTemperature: -11F\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 3 x 250 pound bombs\nFuel: 35%\nTarget: Barracks at airfield\nTarget location: AV/22\nDistance to target: 35 miles\nAltitude: 12,000 feet\n\nIt cleared off nicely today, but the temperature plummeted as a result.  With the bitter cold moving in we decided to hit the barracks on the western end of the airfield.  We may as well make life hell for the enemy.\n\nEnsign Parker reported heavy high-altitude AAA during his recon flight this morning.  Expect heavy AAA as they are expecting an attack with the break in the weather.  Enemy fighter strength is unknown; as the recon photos taken by Ensign Parker were inconclusive.  Fly 210 degrees again and good luck.\n\nYou wil have an escort of course, but if you encounter enemy interceptors in strength, return to the ship immediately.  The Polar Viper and our escorts, the Arctic Tern and the Northern Fox, can fill the air with a withering barrage of AAA.\n\nOh, I almost forgot.  The captain wants all of you morons to attend the chaplain's morals breifing at 1900 tonight.  He thinks all of you need a good dose of God-fearin' fire and brimstone put inta ya.  The captain has told the chaplain to keep the breifing to no more than one hour.  After all, it's poker night in the officer's mess and the captain doesn't want to stay up to late.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Barracks\n
