Short SBD Campaign SBD_D03 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 11, 1943\nTime: 1627\nWeather: Snow\nTemperature: 19F\nClouds: 3,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 1 x 500 pound bomb\nFuel: 50%\nTarget: Ammo bunkers south of airfield\nTarget location: BC/18\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\n\nThis damn weather has kept us grounded for days.  We can't just sit out here earning these big fat paychecks from Uncle Sam for doing nothing - we're bombing something today.  For those crybabys that want to quote me the regulations that state we can't launch bombing raids in bad weather, save your breath.  I was just topside and I can almost see the bow from the bridge.  If that ain't bombing weather then nothin' is!\n\nAnyway, we think the Japanese have lull in the action to repair their airfield and bombers.  We are afraid that they will hit the army airfield again or maybe even come after us once the weather breaks - so we're gonna hit them first!\n\nSeaman Dubbowski spotted what he thought were ammo storage bunkers on the southern side of the airfield during our first raid.  By the way, Seaman Dubbowski did lose three fingers and two toes to frostbite, so keep that in mind when you are up there.  We think he will be able to return to flight status next week.  I don't know why no one else spotted those bunkers.  For a man with only a sixth-grade education he is a helluva lot smarter than the lot of you.\n\nAnyway, he pointed out the two ammo bunkers on recon photos of the airfield.  That's where you are headed today.  Destroy those bunkers south of the airfield and the Jap planes are useless.  Like the radar station, they are made of reinforced concrete and will need a direct hit to destroy them.  Flight 2 will go in first and attack the western bunker.  Flight 1, your flight, will hit the eastern bunker.  That's the one that will be on your left as you pass over the airfield.  \n\nExpect heavy AAA and fighter cover.  The army was going to launch nine B-25s as a diversion to draw off enemy fighters, but fuel contamination related to damage from the last Japanese raid has grounded all of their aircraft. Hit the target hard enough and this could finish off the enemy base.  Make sure you set a delay on your bombs.  If those are ammo storage bunkers, the resulting explosion will be dangerous even at altitude.\n\nFly 170 degrees to reach the target.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Ammo storage bunkers\n
