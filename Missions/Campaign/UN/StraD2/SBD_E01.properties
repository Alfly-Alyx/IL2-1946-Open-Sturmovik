Description June 7, 1943\nTime: 0746\nWeather: Clear\nTemperature: 88F\nClouds: 1,500 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Don Quixote\nAircraft: 1 x SBD-3 Loadout: 3 x 500 pound bombs\nFuel: 100%\nTarget: Land on Castaway Island\nTarget location: D/2\nDistance to target: 10 miles\nAltitude: 500 feet\n\nIt's good to have the squadron back in the South Pacific.  The northern Pacific battles are important to the war effort, but they are hard on the men and even harder on the ships and aircraft.  \n\nBy the way, COMSINCPAC has just notified us that our war bond drive we held during the sqaudron's R&R was the most successful one the USN held this year.  Rear Admiral Beardsley will be sending out a commendation for the whole squadron.  Well done!\n\nThanks again for volunteering for this hazardous mission.  It's time for you to head for your plane as we are almost at Castaway Island.\n\nYour rear gunner for these missions is an odd little fellow, but he spent a lot of time on this little island and knows it like the back of his hand.  He insists that the destroyed base here is a perfect place to launch single plane raids against that Japanese coast watcher hiding somewhere in this chain of islands.\n\nI know you have been having a lot of trouble understanding him, but with a little practice you do get used to his accent.  I know it sounds like Rodney the way he says it, but his name is Randy.  He's a bit touchy about that.  Anyway, the scuttlebutt is that he is a helluva cook and an even better mechanic.  He's the perfect guy to send on this mission with you.\n\nYour plane is fully fueled and loaded out with three 500-pounders.  You have food and water for the next two days.  That puts you 2,500 pounds over the max landing weight for an SBD, but we have no choice; you need to carry all your bombs, fuel and supplies with you.  \n\nNow a few pointers for your landing.  With all that extra weight, not to mention three live bombs on your belly, you want to put her down very gently.  Stay to the left as you approach the landing strip; there are a lot of destroyed aircraft and vehicles on the right hand side of the strip.  Once on the ground, Randy says you can taxi into the hangar off to the right about halfway down the main runway.  It's the only building in good enough shape to allow you to hide your plane.\n\nRemember, the sub will be here to pick you up tomorrow at noon.  Don't be late as they can't stay on the surface very long.  Once the sub picks you up, it will take at least a month for you to get back to us.  It will take longer if you miss the sub and have to swim to us!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach Castaway Island\nSecondary Objective: Land on Castaway Island and taxi to hangar\n\nNOTE: The next 4 missions will start with some poor frame rates.  This is caused by the "set dressing" to make the base look destroyed.  The missions will play fine after the "set dressing" is finished - please be patient.\n
