Description June 7, 1943\nTime: 1537\nWeather: Clear\nTemperature: 95F\nClouds: 1,500 feet\n\nBase: Castaway Island\nAircraft: 1 x SBD-3 Loadout: 1 x 500 pound bomb\nFuel: 90%\nTarget: Recon and targets of opportunity\nTarget location: E/4\nDistance to target: 15 miles\nAltitude: 1,000 feet\n\nThe plan to launch your first armed patrol at noon had to be abandoned when it took a lot longer to prepare the plane for your first mission.  It was decided that you and Randy would take up one bomb at a time, but unloading the two wing mounted bombs proved more difficult than you imagined.  It didn't help that almost nothing works at the base.  Randy warned you the base was a mess, but that was an undesrstatement.  While you pondered the problem of removing the bombs, Randy got one of the derelict trucks running and used it to haul supplies into the hangar.  He fashioned a bomb storage bunker out of sandbags scavenged from around the base.  Your two extra bombs are stored there.  He then found four 55-gallon drums of water for drinking, cooking and bathing.  He also found time to build an outhouse.  Of course, all of these things are inside the hangar to ensure that no Japanese recon planes will spot them. \n\nRandy has also proved invaluable in other ways.  His obsession with safety saved your life when you were offloading the starboard 500-pounder.  If Randy had not insisted on placing chocks on the SBD's wheels, you would have been crushed when a 55-gallon drum fell over and rolled into the landing gear of the SBD.  Fortunately, because of the chocks, the plane couldn't roll over you.  He insisted that the aircraft have chocks in at all times from now on, so you will need to remove them before taxiing out of the hangar.\n\nTurn right after takeoff and head northeast to your first recon waypoint.\n\nWe expect that the coast watcher is hiding somewhere to the north of this airfield.  Exactly where is unknown.  The radio signals from this area are incredibly short; typically 2 or 3 seconds long.  That is not nearly long enough for the coastwatcher to send enough information about our ship movements, so he must be using the radio to send a signal that he has information to pass along.  Then a fishing boat, or possibly a submarine, comes by and gets the info and heads out to sea before passing along the full message.  The waters around the island are very shallow, which means any boats approaching the island would be sitting ducks if you spotted one.  \n\nGet up there and look around.  Check out Ngeregong Island and then check out Eil Malk.  Randy just needs to move the truck to the far side of the hangar and then he will join you in the plane for takeoff.  Be sure you pull deep into the hangar at the end of the mission.  We don't want anyone spotting your aircraft.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach recon sector E/3\nSecondary Objective: Destroy any target of opportunity\n
