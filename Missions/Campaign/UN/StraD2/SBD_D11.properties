Description February 22, 1943\nTime: 0645\nWeather: Hazy\nTemperature: 4F\nClouds: 1,600 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 1 x SBD-3\nLoadout: 1 x 250 pound bomb\nFuel: 50%\nTarget: Locate downed B-25 crew\nTarget location: AF/24\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 1,000 feet\n\nSeaman Dubbowski flew one mission with us after returning to duty and was seriously injured by a flak burst.  He was hit in the right leg and will probably lose the leg below the knee.  And that was the leg that hadn't lost any toes to frostbite.  He was also hit in the throat and the doc says he'll never speak again.  At least he's alive.\n\nA B-25 on a regular recon patrol did not return to the army airfield last night.  The army asked us to keep an eye out for the missing bomber.  During his 0400 recon flight this morning, Ensign Parker spotted some wreckage on the small penninsula in sector AF/24.  The visibility was poor so early in the morning, but he identified the crashed aircraft as a B-25.  He also spotted some red recognition panels in the shape of an 'X'.  Hopefully, this is the B-25 that went down yesterday and not another aircraft that may have crashed weeks ago.  There is a good chance at least some of the crew is still alive today.\n\nThe main reason the army wants us to find the plane is because it was carrying a highly classified camera.  They don't want this camera to fall into enemy hands.  Therefore, if you find the downed aircraft and the crew is dead, you are to use the single 250 pound bomb you are carrying to destroy the B-25.  Dump the bomb prior to returning the carrier if you do not use it.  Make sure that the crew is dead before dropping the bomb.  That means a low pass so that you can survey the wreckage and spot any survivors.  Fly 285 degrees.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach sector AF/24\nSecondary Objective: Locate the crew or destroy the downed aircraft\n
