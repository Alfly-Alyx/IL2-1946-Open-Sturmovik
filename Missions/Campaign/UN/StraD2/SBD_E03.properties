Description June 8, 1943\nTime: 0530\nWeather: Clear\nTemperature: 85F\nClouds: 3,500 feet\n\nBase: Castaway Island\nAircraft: 1 x SBD-3 Loadout: 1 x 500 pound bomb\nFuel: 65%\nTarget: Coastwatcher hut\nTarget location: E/4\nDistance to target: 20 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\n\nAfter you went to sleep last night, Randy swam the ten miles over to the enemy island (he hadn't told you that he won two gold medals in swimming during the Berlin Olympic Games).\n\nBy the fire from the burning wreckage of the fishing boat he was able to spot the coastwatcher's hut.  He saw the survivors from the fishing boat salvaging some weapons from the wreckage and fortifying the coastwatcher's hut with them.  They moved two heavy machine guns, half a dozen rifles and at least ten crates of food and other supplies into the hut.  The hut is just at the edge of the clearing facing the destroyed fishing boat.\n\nOn the swim back he caught a sea bass and cooked it up for breakfast.  After you eat, return to the area with a 500 pound bomb and destroy the hut and its occupants.  If they spot you, expect heavy MG fire as you dive on the target.\n\nRandy will join you in the plane as soon as finishes smoothing out several bumps in front of the hangar with the bulldozer he pulled out of the swamp several hours ago.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach sector E/4\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the coastwatcher's hut\n
