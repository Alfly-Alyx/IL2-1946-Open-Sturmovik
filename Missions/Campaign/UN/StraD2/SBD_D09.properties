Description February 19, 1943\nTime: 0535\nWeather: Clear\nTemperature: 14F\nClouds: 4,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 1 x 500 pound bomb\nFuel: 50%\nTarget: Submarine\nTarget location: BE/25\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 12,000 feet\n\nI know you all hate all these early morning recon flights.  Keep in mind that we are doing this to protect the carrier.  With the loss of the Arctic Tern we have no choice but to stop any attacks as far from the Polar Viper as possible.  With only one escort, our odds of survival are slim if a jap sub gets close to us.  One of those recon flights paid off this morning.  \n\nEnsign Parker spotted a sub on his 0400 recon flight..  He is holding position near the enemy.  Follow a course of 005 degrees to reach Ensign Parker.  Now get up there and get that sub before he gets us!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach sector BE/25\nSecondary Objective: Submarine\n
