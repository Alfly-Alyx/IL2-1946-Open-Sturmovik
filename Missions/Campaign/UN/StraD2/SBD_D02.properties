Name SBD_D02
Short SBD Campaign SBD_D02 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 5, 1943\nTime: 0958\nWeather: Poor\nTemperature: -7F\nClouds: 3,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 4 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 1 x 500 pound bomb\nFuel: 50%\nTarget: Radar near Airfield\nTarget location: BC/18\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nI hope you noticed it cooled off a bit today.  That's right boys its seven degrees outside.  Seven BELOW zero.  Seaman Dubbowski didn't listen to me and it looks like he will loose a few fingers and toes from the frostbite he got yesterday.  You other rear gunners need to watch the temperatures and keep warm as best you can.\n\nI gave you the talk on crash landing and bailing out during the last briefing.  To summarize that brief,  don't do it.  Today I need to brief you on carrier defense.  If you ever encounter enemy strike aircraft heading for this ship, you are to abort your mission immediately and defend the carrier at all costs.  I really should't have to remind you that if this ship goes down, you don't have a place to land.\n\nBack to today's briefing.  Nice job hitting the airbase two days ago.  The army guys should be safe for a few days while the Japs try to piece together their bombers and airfield.\n\nYour target for today is the radar and weather station near the airbase.  We need a direct hit on the building to destroy it since it is a reinforced concrete structure.\n\nExpect heavy AAA as they know we are out here somewhere.  If you get a fuel leak, head home as soon as possible!  With your limited fuel, leaks can be... correction, leaks WILL be deadly!  I can't say how many enemy fighters will be up to intercept you.  It all depends on how much damage you did during your last attack.  Fly 210 degrees again and good luck.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Radar/Weather Station\n
