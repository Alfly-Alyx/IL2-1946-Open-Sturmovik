Name * Straight Down Some More
Description A Single Player Campaign for the SBD (game version 4.04m or higher)\n\nEarly 1943\nYou have already completed two tours of duty in the South Pacific (see "Straight Down") and for your next tour of duty you will be heading to the northern Pacific on board the Polar Viper.  The Polar Viper is a Casablanca-class carrier which has been heavily modified for arctic operations.  Her bow has been strengthened to handle ice up to eight inches thick, she carries 50% more fuel than a standard escort carrier, and all her external gear will function down to 30 below zero.\n\nLike her namesake, she is small, tough, deadly and hard to find.  The real polar viper has been known to kill polar bears with a single strike.  We expect this viper to be just as deadly to our enemy.\n\nYou may select any rank you want to play this campaign.  The campaign has been structured so that you will always be assigned to "flight 1" no matter what rank you start with.  I strongly suggest "map icons" be turned off so that the missions have an element of surprise.  You should also play with limited ammo and fuel.  Mini-map on will be useful in some missions.  Pay attention to the briefings for target, weather and interceptor info; the breifings are "usually" accurate.
