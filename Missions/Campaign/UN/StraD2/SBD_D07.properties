Short SBD Campaign SBD_D07 by Zeus-cat\n
Description February 14, 1943\nTime: 1341\nWeather: Snow\nTemperature: 31F\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 4 x FM-2\nLoadout: 3 x 250 pound bombs\nFuel: 35%\nTarget: Icebound freighters and cargo\nTarget location: AX/18\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 4,500 feet\n\nAs most of you know, one of our escorts, the Artcic Tern, was lost with all hands during the Japanese attack this morning.  Most men went down with the ship, which sank almost immediately after being hit.  A few  men made it overboard, but the bitterly cold water took them before they could be picked up.  We recovered 17 men after the attack.  Unfortunately, all were dead from exposure before we pulled them out of the water.  \n\nThere can be little doubt that the intended target of the attack was the Polar Viper.  The near blizzard conditions this morning caused the jap dive-bombers to attack the wrong ship.  I know you all want to go hit that jap airbase today in revenge, but our target is still the freighters and their cargo we couldn't get to this morning.  Flight 1 will target the northern freighter.  Flight 2 will target the southern freighter.  If the cargo has been unloaded from the ships, attack it instead.  The ships will be crushed and sink soon enough.  \n\nYou have permission to search the area at low level and strafe any vehicles heading across the ice.  Search the area east and northeast of the ships.  Pressure ridges in the ice that are at least 40 feet high will make it impossible for the vehicles to head south or west.  \n\nBefore I forget, visibility is still crap!  As I briefed you this morning, climb to 4,500 feet to make your attack and fly course 200.  Adjust your attack accordingly if the visibility isn't good enough at that altitude.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the cargo\n
