Short SBD Campaign SBD_E04 by Zeus-cat\n
Description June 8, 1943\nTime: 1135\nWeather: Clear\nTemperature: 95F\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nBase: Castaway Island\nAircraft: 1 x SBD-3 Loadout: 1 x 500 pound bomb\nFuel: 25%\nTarget: unknown\nTarget location: E/4\nDistance to target: 20 miles\nAltitude: 500 feet\n\nLooks like mission accomplished!  You were certain that the bomb you dropped demolished the hut and anyone in it, but Randy insists that you load up the last 500-pounder and head back to the target area before heading to the rendezvous point.  You think it's a waste of time, but this crazy Aussie (is there any other kind?) has certainly earned your respect.  You decide to humor him and load up the last 500-pounder and fill up the ammo trays for the 50's in case you need to strafe something.  Randy says to come in low and have a good look at the area near the hut and in the bay for any activity.\n\nThe Gato class submarine, USS Long John Silver, will be in the middle of sector E/2 at 1200 hours to pick you up.  Ditch your faithful SBD as close to the sub as possible.  It's a shame to abandon her as she has done her job so well, but when you rejoin the carrier you will be issued a brand new SBD-5.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach sector E/4\nSecondary Objective: Destroy any targets of opportunity\n\nFor more fun and adventure with Randy on Castaway Island, download Dubbo's "Castaway" campaign from airwarfare.com\n
