Description February 21, 1943\nTime: 1645\nWeather: Hazy\nTemperature: 30F\nClouds: 4,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Polar Viper\nAircraft: 9 x SBD-3 and 4 x P-40E\nLoadout: 3 x 250 pound bombs\nFuel: 50%\nTarget: Three Bridges\nTarget location: AH/24, AF/25 and AE/25\nDistance to target: 20 miles to first target\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nThe brass decided that we should work with the army boys on a few operations since we put that jap base out of action.  We moved to sector AI/21 last night and we will be operating near the army airfield for the next few days.  In another act of cooperation, we will have an escort of P-40's from the base instead of our usual FM-2's.  Rendezvous with your escorts in the middle of sector AJ/23.\n\nThe targets for today are three bridges in sectors AH/24, AF/25 and AE/25.  Enemy ground forces have been spotted using these bridges and we want to put an end to whatever they have planned.\n\nOne flight is assigned to take out each bridge.  Flight 3 will take out the bridge in sector AH/24.  Flight 2 will take out the bridge in sector AF/25.  Flight 1 will take out the farthest bridge which is in sector AE/25.\n\nEach flight will return to the ship after hitting their target.  Since we clobbered the enemy base we shouldn't encounter any enemy aircraft.\n\nWe have all been waiting for Seaman Dubbowski to return to duty.  I m happy to report that he will be joining us today.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach all three target areas\nSecondary Objective: Destroy all three bridges\n
