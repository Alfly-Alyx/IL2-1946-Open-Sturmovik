Description MISSION 17:  Taffy 2\n\nDATE:  October 25, 1944\n\nTIME:  3:30 p.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Hazy\n\nUnbelievable.  At first we thought they were coming in too close, making sure their bombs hit us.  Then we realized it was a mass suicide attack.\n\nSeveral of our ships have been damaged, a few sunk.  One of the CVEs from Taffy 3 has been like a magnet to them:  the poor bastards have been hit multiple times.\n\nIt's your turn to go up and meet the next wave.  Again, they're coming in from the north northwest.\n
