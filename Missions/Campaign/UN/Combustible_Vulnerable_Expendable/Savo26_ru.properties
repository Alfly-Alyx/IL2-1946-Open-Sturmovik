Name Savo26
Description MISSION 26:  West of Mindoro\n\nDATE:  January 30th, 1945\n\nTIME:  5:30 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb. Bombs\n\nAn enemy convoy was late getting started from the Palawans last night.  One of our PBYs spotted it at daybreak.\n\nYou will escort Avengers to the target.  Concentrate your bombs on the thin-hulled cargo ships.  The Avengers will use their torpedos on the escort warships.\n\nAfter this mission you'll be heading back to Ulithi.  The Savo Island will be taking on a new aircrew, and you--lucky you--will most likely be heading back to the States for a while.  If you're lucky, this god-awful war will end before you have to come back for a business trip to Japan.\n\nDon't get yourself killed on your last mission!  \n
