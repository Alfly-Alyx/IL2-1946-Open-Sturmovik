Description MISSION 14:  Taffy 2\n\nDATE:  October 25, 1944\n\nTIME:  7:50 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb.  Bombs\n\nThis is not good.  The CVE group north of us--Taffy 3--has been under attack by enemy battleships and cruisers for the last half-hour.\n\nEvidently the Japanese, bluffing with carriers, has successfully lured our main carrier force away from Leyte.  The only thing standing between the enemy battleships and our invasion forces in Leyte gulf right now are our three CVE groups.  It's not our kind of fight.\n\nTaffy 3 has been fighting for their lives.  They don't even have the proper weaponry to fight the huge battlewagons.  Avengers are dropping depth charges on them, while Wildcats are flying at them unarmed to keep the anti-aircraft guns busy!\n\nWe've been ordered to throw everything we have at the enemy force.  If the Japanese get through us, it could be a disaster.  Go drop your bombs on the first Japanese ship you see.  Be prepared for intense AA fire.\n
