Description MISSION 1:  Softening Up Peleliu\n\nDATE:  September 15, 1944\n\nTIME:  7:00 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb. Bombs\n\nPeleliu seems like it might be tougher than the brass thought.  I hope they're right when they say it'll take only four days for our boys to take it.\n\nThere's a hell of a lot of AAA and small arms fire coming up at our planes on the horizon, though.  I don't like the look of it.  Some of our pilots report that the island is a lot more hilly and craggy than we thought it would be, too.  The Japanese will no doubt know how to use that to their advantage.\n\nWe're strapping bombs to our Wildcats this morning.  Our mission is to help take care of some of that artillery and AAA on the ridge in the center of the island.\n\nThe Marines are getting ready to go in.  We've got to make their trip as unexciting for them as we can.\n\nATTENTION:  For this and all subsequent missions, please select the following skin for your aircraft--\nWW_FM-2_VC-27_NM.bmp (Markings ON)\n
