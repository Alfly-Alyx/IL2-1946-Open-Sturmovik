Description MISSION 2:  Patrol Over Invasion Force\n\nDATE:  September 15, 1944\n\nTIME: 8:30 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nIn the last month, we've pretty much destroyed every enemy aircraft and airbase on the big northern island of Babelthuap.  Japanese air activity has therefore been light over Palau.  The Japanese are skilled at masking the true extent of  their strength, though.\n\nOne of our Catalinas has just spotted a group of single-engined aircraft traveling towards our invasion force. \n\nThe Marines are starting to go in on the LVTs.  We can't allow enemy aircraft anywhere near our vulnerable troops.  Your job is to stay above the landing zone, standing guard.\n
