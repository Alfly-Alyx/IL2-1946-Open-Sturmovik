Description MISSION 11:  Patrol Over Beaches and Shipping\n\nDATE:  October 24, 1944\n\nTIME:  9:00 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Hazy\n\nOur troops have consolidated their hold on the entire eastern side of Leyte.  The western side may be a harder nut to crack.  The Japanese have dug themselves into fortified positions in the highlands and on several ridges on the northwest quarter of the island.  They are also strong at the town of Ormoc.  It's not going to be easy going.\n\nEnemy air activity has been relatively light so far.  However, spotters to the north have reported large enemy formations gathering over Luzon and Mindoro this morning.  We can guess where they're heading.\n\nYour job is to fly patrol over the beaches and shipping.  You're pretty sure to get some air-to-air action today.\n
