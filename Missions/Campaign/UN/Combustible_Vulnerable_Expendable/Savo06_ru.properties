Description MISSION 6:\n\nDATE:  September 23, 1944\n\nTIME:  9:20 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Murky\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb. Bombs\n\nPeleliu has become a nightmare for our Marines.  I don't think the folks back home have any idea how bad this is.  There's nothing for it but to keep flushing the Japanese out, cave by cave, and killing them all.  They'll never give up.\n\nFor us, it's been a tedious couple of weeks.  This morning ought to be interesting, though.  A Catalina has spotted a well-concealed enemy airstrip on Babelthuap, which the Japanese have managed to keep in good supply.\n\nThe task of destroying the base and any shipping in the area has fallen to our Avengers.  We'll also carry bombs on our Wildcats for targets of opportunity.  If enemy fighters show up, our main priority is to protect our bombers.\n
