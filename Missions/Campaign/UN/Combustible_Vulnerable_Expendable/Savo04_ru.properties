Description MISSION 4:  Bomb Bloody Nose Ridge\n\nDATE:  September 16, 1944\n\nTIME:  6:30 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Morning Haze\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb. Bombs\n\nOur Marines have nearly secured the airfield on Peleliu.\n\nThe Japanese did not defend the beachhead as strongly as we had expected.  Instead, they've burrowed hundreds of caves and a tunnel system into the craggy ridge in the middle of the island, for an "in depth" defence.  They're going to make us fight for every inch of this worthless piece of rock.  It's going to be hell clearing them out of there.\n\nAll we can really do to support the Marines is to keep on pouring the hurt on the enemy positions on the ridge.  Obviously it's not doing much immediate good.  They're dug in deep.   At least we can make life miserable for them.  The Corsairs and Hellcats are using napalm on them.  I'd never seen it till now.  It's a gruesome weapon.  We can actually smell burning flesh in our cockpits if we stay over the ridge long enough.\n\nOur planes have been loaded with 100 pound bombs for this mission.  Go in and hit whatever you can on the ridge.  Watch out for AAA!\n
