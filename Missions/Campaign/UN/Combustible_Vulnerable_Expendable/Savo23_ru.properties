Description MISSION 23:  Strike on Del Carmen Field\n\nDATE:  January 10th, 1945\n\nTIME:  7:30 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Murky\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb. Bombs\n\nThe invasion force met little resistance on the beaches yesterday and the weather was beautiful, but now the wind is picking up and the waves are getting bad.  We've gotten a hell of a lot of men onto Luzon, but we might have to halt the landings for a while.\n\nIn the meantime, enemy aircraft have been pestering us from airfields on the corridor towards Manila.  Today we'll pay a visit to Del Carmen airfield, just south of Clark, and drop some eggs on it.\n\nWatch out for Army pilots, who've also been working on ground targets in the area.  Feel free to strafe any ground targets you see on the way home.\n
