Description MISSION 18:  Patrol Convoy Lanes to Leyte\n\nDATE:  November 24, 1944\n\nTIME:  8:00 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nThose weeks of rest and refitting at Manus were a much needed relief.\n\nAfter all that action off Samar, this escort work is nice and boring.  We've had hardly any action out here in the deeps off Leyte.\n\nThis morning our Avengers went off to check on a submarine threat.  They're not back yet.  But now our radar has picked up a small blip to the northwest, heading in our direction at about 2000 meters.  It may be an enemy recon plane--or it may be something worse.\n\nGo check it out!\n
