Description MISSION 13:  Patrol Over Beaches and Shipping\n\nDATE:  October 24, 1944\n\nTIME: 5:30 p.m.\n\nWEATHER: Clear\n\nDodging all these flaming Japanese airplanes starts getting on the nerves after a while.  Hardly an hour goes by without a new swarm of enemy aircraft buzzing in, hell-bent on taking some of us with them.\n\nThey've gotten a few of our ships, but all in all it seems like a waste of potential pilots.  Our radar doesn't catch the ones who come in at wave-top level, so we have to be vigilant.  They could do some real damage if they got through our defences.  \n\nOnce again, it's your turn to go up and watch for incoming enemy aircraft.  Let's hope that things quiet down tomorrow.\n
