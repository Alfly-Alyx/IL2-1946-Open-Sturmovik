Description MISSION 19:  Strike Airbase on Mindoro\n\nDATE:  December 10, 1944\n\nTIME:  7:30 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Clear\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb. Bombs\n\nNo matter how hard our engineers work on them, the airbases on Leyte just aren't good enough for our purposes.  We need adequate support for our upcoming invasion of Luzon.  Mindoro and its airbases are the answer.\n\nWe're heading towards San Jose, a town on the western side of the island near one of the better deepwater ports.\n\nWe have five days before the amphibious assault begins.  Today you're going to hit the airbase near San Jose.  AAA and vehicles will be your main concern.  Watch out for enemy fighters.\n
