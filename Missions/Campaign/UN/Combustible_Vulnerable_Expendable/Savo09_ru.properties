Description MISSION 9: Support Over Leyte Beaches\n\nDATE:  October 20, 1944\n\nTIME:  10:00 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb. Bombs\n\nThe party is on.  After a tremendous naval bombardment this morning, the troop ships started heading in.  It was an awesome sight.\n\nThe troops on the northern beaches are tasked with taking the town of Tacloban and its vital airfield.\n\nRecon aircraft have reported that some rusty enemy warships are bottled up in the small Tacloban harbor.  We don't know whether they can even move, but we can't risk having their guns so close to our ground troops.  \n\nOur Avengers are heading in to go after the ships.  Your job is to go in ahead of them to suppress enemy AA fire coming from the airbase and inner harbor area.  After using your bombs, feel free to strafe targets of opportunity around the airbase and town.  Just don't let the Avengers go home alone!\n
