Description MISSION 12:  Patrol Over Beaches and Shipping\n\nDATE:  October 24, 1944\n\nTIME: 11:00 a.m.\n\nWEATHER: Good\n\nThe Japanese are throwing everything they have at us today.  It's a chaotic mix of airplanes, old and new.  Some of their pilots are very good, others fly like they have three hours behind the stick.\n\nOur radar is picking up another wave coming in from the north, above Samar.  It's your flight's turn to go up again.  This is shaping up to be a long day.\n
