Description MISSION 7:  Goodbye to Peleliu\n\nDATE:  September 30, 1944\n\nTIME:  5:30 p.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Light Haze\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb. Bombs\n\nThank God, tomorrow we leave this hell.\n\nI feel sorry for the G.I.s, who have pretty much taken over now from the Marines.  The way things have been going, it's going to take them weeks to clear this island.\n\nTomorrow we head to Manus to rest and refit.  Then, from what we hear, we're heading into a big one--the invasion of the Philippines.  \n\nBefore you get there, though, you've got to get through tonight's mission.  Surprise--it's another bombing-strafing run on Bloody Nose Ridge.\n
