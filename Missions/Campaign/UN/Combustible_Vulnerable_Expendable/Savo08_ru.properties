Description MISSION 8:  Kicking Down the Door\n\nDATE:  October 17, 1944\n\nTIME:  8:00 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nLOADOUT:  Two 100 lb. Bombs\n\nThe excitement is palpable.  Everyone knows that this is a big moment in history.  Our forces are so dominant that the end can not really be in doubt.  The Japanese are not going to give up, though.  We're in for a tough fight.\n\nI can only imagine how the Japanese commanders must feel when they see battleships which were at Pearl Harbor streaming towards them at the head of a thousand-ship armada!  It is an amazing feeling, being part of such a powerful force.  No wonder MacArthur confuses himself with God sometimes.\n\nOur first job is to neutralize enemy forces on the small islands which guard the entrance to Leyte Gulf.  \n\nUse your bombs on any hardened targets, and then strafe targets of opportunity.  While over the target, you're also responsible for covering the transports and landing craft.\n
