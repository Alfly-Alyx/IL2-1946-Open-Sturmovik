Description MISSION 16:  Taffy 2\n\nDATE:  October 25, 1944\n\nTIME:  12:15 p.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nThis day just won't end.  After launching more than six waves of aircraft towards those monstrous warships, we thought we might get some rest.\n\nBut now radar is picking up a formation coming in from the north at different heights.  As much as we might hope it's a flock of geese, it's probably not.  Time to get back into the sky.\n
