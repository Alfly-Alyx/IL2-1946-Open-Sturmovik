Description MISSION 5:  Patrol Over Peleliu\n\nDATE:  September 18, 1944\n\nTIME:  11:00 a.m.\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nWe took Angaur, the little island directly to the southwest of Peleliu, with very little trouble.  \n\nPeleliu is also mostly in our hands, too...at least in terms of square feet.  Marine Corsairs are now flying ground attack missions from the airstrip.  But nothing we do seems able to dislodge the Japanese from the higher ground.  The Marines are calling it "Bloody Nose Ridge."  Their losses are mounting quickly.  This place better be worth the trouble.\n\nWe've been flying circles over the island constantly for the past three days, guarding against incoming enemy aircraft.  It's a tedious business, because nothing much has happened.  Occasionally a high-flying "Dinah" recon plane will come over from the Philippines to check us out.  Even our Corsairs have trouble catching them when they have such a height advantage. \n\nToday we're flying another patrol over the island.  Avengers, Hellcats and Corsairs have been pounding it all day.  Watch for enemy planes that try to sneak in under the radar.\n
