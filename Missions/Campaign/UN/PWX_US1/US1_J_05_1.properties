Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nPacific Ocean,\n250 miles northwest of the Rotuma Island.\n\nFebruary 8th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nOur battleship group was sighted by enemy planes!\n\nBefore you shot down the enemy reconaissance planes one hour ago they were able to report our battleship's position over radio.\nAt the time this happened, we got a message of one of our early reconaissance SBDs, that enemy ships were detected not far away.\n\nWe didn't recieve the precise position and no data about speed and course, so we're not just able to launch an attack against them.\nThe two planes are missed until now.\n\nNow we have to take into account that the enemy could launch an attack against our battleships.\n\nThey need air cover...\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nSecure the airspace over our battleship group.\n\nTime: 05:50\nAltitude: 3000m\nFlight: Yuri- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear morning.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
