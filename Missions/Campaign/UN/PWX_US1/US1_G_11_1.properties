Only a handful fighters are getting up from there. Somewhat stronger is the enemy at Tulagi.\nA couple of floatplane bombers must still be estimated to be anywhere around there.\nThese planes are a threat for our carriers.\n\nSo we have to concentrate our efforts on Tulagi now. The next raid is ordered to shut off the last enemy air defense and to attack the installations which are important for operating the float bombers.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nEscort our bombers to Tulagi.\n\nTime: 10:15\nAltitude: 9000ft\nFlight: Raven- Three\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
