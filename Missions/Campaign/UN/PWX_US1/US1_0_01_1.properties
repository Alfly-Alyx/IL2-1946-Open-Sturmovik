As you thought!\n\nIn the first hour of your date you got some doupts if you really were in control of the situation.\n\nIn the second hour you had no doubt that it was a nice new expierience to give the control into the hands of this beautiful girl wth this wonderful voice.\n\nSometime between the second and third hour she gave you a little kiss and you were surprised how interesting everything was what she told you\n\nWith the beginning of the fourth hour you were a little boy with red ears and an idiotic grin on your face.\n\nAt the end of the fourth hour you brought her back to her parent's home and just in the moment the fifth hour began, she wished you a happy birthday.\n\nThen she kissed you!\nOoooh Ray!\nThen a storm broke out.\n\nNot one of the sort you would perhaps think now.\nA very different type of storm broke out.\n\nYour car's door was flinged open.\nIce cold iron was pressed against your temple.\n\nA voice, cold as the iron, hissed:\n'Sarah... into the house.. .Immediately!'\n\nFrom your right you heard the sound of an opening car door. You slowly turned your head to the left.\n\nilluminated by your weak car interior light you saw a dark red pyjama from which's arm a Cal. 0.45 Colt Government was pressed against your head.\n\nSarah's dad.\nThe General!\n\nQuickly the cold iron pressed your head back to look straight ahead.\n\nSarah disappeared out of your car's headlights.\n\nOoooh Ray!\nWhat a tough luck.\n\nIn the next moment the cold voice was close at your ear. \nIt asked you for your name, rank and unit.\nFull of fear you gave all relevant informations which are needed to ruin your career.\nThen the dark cold voice whispered something about a horny cat which will die if it tries to play with his daughter's balloons. \nAnd it hissed something about the vulnerability of dirty little horny cat's balls.\n\nThen, as quick as it came the red pyjama disappeared in the dark.\n\n\nYou immediately returned to your barracks on Ford Island.\n\nSince you woke up in the morning you were waiting to be called to your officer.\nBut nothing happened.\n\nIs it possible that the story ends here?\n\n\nThe first real landings on a carrier are standing on the plan for today....\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nLand on the Lexington's flight deck.\n\nTime: 10:15\nAltitude: 1500ft\nFlight: Rainbow- Three\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
