March 18th, 1942\n\n==================\n\nSITUATIONAL REPORT:\n\nYesterday the first day of the battle for Tarawa brought no decision. \nBoth, Tarawa and the Enterprise Group were attacked two times. So was a Japanese carrier group which was detected abaout 400 miles southwest of Tarawa.\n\nEnemy:\nThere are reports from the second raid against the Japanese battlegroup that a second carrier arrived in the afternoon. Identified markings on planes which attacked the Enterprise in the evening seem to confirm this informations. So it has to be taken into account that the enemy is operating with at least two fleet carriers.\nA landing force has to be estimated to be near too.\nAllthough reports from our first raid indicated, that the enemy carrier was hit, the remnants of the second raid didn't confirm this information. It has to be estimated that the enemy is still fully operational with two carriers.\n\nEnemy strength:\nAt least two carriers with normally about 80 planes each.\nThe Japanese lost about 40 bombers and 18 fighters during the yesterday operations. So it is estimated that the enemy still has at least 100 planes operational.\n\nOne battleship and two cruisers were sighted along with a couple of destroyers. It has to be taken into account that there will be more naval forces with the landing force.\n\n\nUS- Forces:\n\nTarawa:\nThe greater part of the of the Tarawa Air Group's planes are lost in two attacks against the enemy carrier group. There are 3 F4F, 9 P-39s, 3 TBF-1, 6 SBDs, 4 B-25 and 2 B-17 left operational.\nBetio airfield itself was badly hit in two attacks. The airstrip is still operational.\n\nEnterprise Group:\nThe Enterprise was hit by one bomb and one Torpedo. during the second attack from the enemy's carrier group yesterday. Through these hits 3 TBF, 6 SBD and 4 F4Fs were so hardly damaged, that the planes had to be written off.\nUntil today's morning the repairs were brought to a state where the ship is fully operational again.\nDuring the defense of the Enterprise 5 more F4Fs were lost. From reconnaissance missions 3 SBDs didn't come back. Several planes of the various types are under repair.\nThe Enterprise Air Group has 19 F4Fs, 18 SBDs and 13 TBFs left operational.\n\nSo, our combined air units consist of 31 fighters, 24 dive-,  16 torpedo bombers and 6 bombers. Enough forces for a further attack on the enemy. \n\nNow it's clear that both sides will have to reconnoitre the position of the opponent's carrier group.\nThis is the time for forward fighter area control missions to interrupt the enemy's reconnaissance.\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nForward Fighter Air Control.\n\nTime: 07:31\nAltitude:  15000ft\nFlight: Coconut- Three\n\nWeather forecast:\nStormy early morning. Satisfying visibility.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
