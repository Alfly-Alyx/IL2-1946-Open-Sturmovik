Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nPacific Ocean\n800 miles southwest of Hawaii\n\nFebruary 13th, 1943\n\n=================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nFive days have passed since the carrier battle on the 8th.\nAll in all, the outcome of the battle can be described as a draw.\n\nA cruel draw for the air groups of both carriers.\n\nIf it's true, that the Japanese, like us, had sent their last remaining planes into the attack at the 8th' evening then the battle ate the great majority of the air group's airmen and material.\n\nAlthough both carriers were hit, partially badly, the ships survived the battle. Not so the air groups.\n\nIt seems that the fact, that the first attacks went against well defended battleships the losses of both side's bomber forces were so serious that the final and decisive raids against the carriers didn't succeed.\n\nOnly one day of intense battle cost your squadron 23 planes lost, three planes damaged and 19 pilots dead or missing, and 3 wounded. The dive- and torpedo bomber units have lost many more.\n\nNow you're on the way back to Pearl Harbor. \nThere your squadron will be reinforced-\nFor the next slaughter?\n\n\nMission Orders:\n--------------------\nCombat Air Patrol forward the carrier group.\n\nTime: 05:55\nAltitude: 3000ft\nFlight: Catball- One.\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSlight morning haze. Fresh winds.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
