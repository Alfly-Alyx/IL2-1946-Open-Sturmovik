Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nBetio Island Airbase, Tarawa Atoll...... \n\nJune 4th, 1943\n\n==================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nTask Force 44.2 is beeing attacked!\n\nThe Hornet is seriously damaged.\n\nLike the old famous Preussian military thinker General von Moltke said:\n'No military plan survives the first minutes of contact with the enemy.'\n\nThis whole operation is standing under a dark star.\nBetio Island was numerous times attacked but the airfield seems still to be operational. Although a great number of planes were destroyed on the ground and in the air, the Japanese are still able to launch air strikes.\n\nNow the Saratoga Group is beeing detected and attacked. From where are the Japanese taking all these planes?\nWe shoot down at least as many fighters as we loose. We should have a big numerical superiority and this battle of attrition should deplete the enemy fighter force. But still the air is full of them.\n\nIt's impossible that they all are coming from Tarawa. There must be a Japanese carrier in the area.\n\nSome of our reconaissance planes are missing.\nA sign for enemy fighters at places where nobody estimated some to be.\n\nAdmiral Spruance has ordered a strengthening of the reconaissance.\n\nWe have so many questions.\nAnd as it seems the Japanese have many more answers today.\n\nThe enemy air raid has weakened the fighter defense over Task Force 44.2.\nThe Essex Fighter Group is ordered to support the defense of TF 44.2.\n\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nSecure the airspace over Task Group 44.2\n\nTime: 07:15\nAltitude:  4500ft\nFlight: Blue Alpha- One\n\nWeather forecast:\nSunny and clear\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
