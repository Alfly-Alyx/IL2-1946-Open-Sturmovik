Reaching this our today evening's position without any losses is a great success.\nAlthough at least the Essex was spotted twice, no enemy bombers were able to come close to the group.\n\nThe Betties which closed our group in the morning were terribly shot together while out of sight of the ships and turned home. At least a dozen of the enemy bombers didn't make it home.\n\nEven if the Japanese do know now that we're coming it's too late to save Tarawa from beeing attacked by the combined force of three carrier's air groups.\n\nIn one hour the sun will dawn.\nThen the Japanese won't have anything more than an impossible chance to harm us.\nWhen the sun rises our planes will just be over Betio Island to attack the enemy prior of taking off.\n\n\nFor the last light of the day you assigned yourself to today's last forward air patrol mission.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nForward Air Patrol.\n\nTime: 17:30\nAltitude: 10000ft\nFlight: Bad Cat- One.\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear evening.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
