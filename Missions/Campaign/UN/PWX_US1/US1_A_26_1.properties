Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\nHawaii Islands,\nOahu, Pearl Harbor.\n\nAugust 27th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\nSituation:\n\nHappy Birthday!\n\nOne year ago you had a wonderful evening with Sarah and it was peace.\nIt was that day when your life changed.\nWhen you woke up you remembered Sarah again.\nYou would like to see her again and yesterday evening you tried to find her. But you had no luck.\nNobody couldn't or didn't want to tell you where she is.\nYou won't see her again.\n\nThe attack of the japanese floatplane fighters on Admiral Nimitz' plane at the 5th came as a total shock to the head command.\nHow could this be possible?\nThousands of miles away from any japanese base, without the risk of sending a carrier into american waters.\nHow could this be possible.\nSome think that the japanese used submarines to fuel up the fighters at several places until they reached Hawaii's waters.\nBut how could they know that Nimitz was on the way?\n\nThe military intelligence service started a big investigation to find out from where the Japanese got the informations about Nimitz' flight.\n\nThe admiral thanked you and you men personally for saving him.\n\nOn the 10th you recieved the order to transfer your squadron to Kauai. \nThere we are operating two airfields.\nOne at the southern coast and one, a little mystic, on top of a mountain.\nThe head command wants fighters on the island for a forward security screen against any other japanese surprise.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nLand at Hilltop Field.\n\nTime:18:38\nAltitude: 6000ft\nFlight: Bad Cat- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny evening.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
