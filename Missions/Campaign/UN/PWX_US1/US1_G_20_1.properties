At the end of the struggle for the Southhill 1210 dead bodies and 21 heavily wounded Japanese were found. Not one single Japanese gave up.\nThe Marines had to take great losses too.\nAs long as a Japanese soldier is alive he is a deadly threat. Great material superiority has to be brought to effect to defeat the enemy.\nAn ugly war of attrition.\nBefore the war the Japs were believed to be backward and primitive. That's clearly not true.\nIn our western eyes they're somewhat archaic. \nBut not backward or primitive. \nWe will take Guadalcanal. That's for sure. But we will have to pay a high prize for it.\n\nThe Carrier Air Units lost nearly the half of their planes. \nAdmiral Spruance decided to send two of the carriers back to Pearl Harbor. In the morning the carrier group with the Wasp and the Hornet left the battlefield. The remaining planes of the group transfered to your carrier group and were allocated to the Enterprise and the Saratoga.\n\nSoutheast of the Lunga Airfield a small height is defended by a Japanese stronghold. \nThe Marines called for air support.\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nAttack the enemy positions with bombs.\n\n\nTime: 17:22\nAltitude: 1500ft\nFlight: Raven- Three\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny, strong winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
