On the base you saw three brandnew fighter types.\nWhen you came to Wheeler at the 19th, you were welcomed by the commander of the Marines Fighter Squadron VMF-113, Major Pat 'Rosie' Rosenberg.\n\nHe is the leading fighter ace of the Marines and a really great guy. Although a dirteater, a Marine, the man became immediately your friend.\nHe told you that your squadron is about to be the second unit to recieve the F4U too and that his best squadron members would train you and your men on the new ride.\n\nAnd he's not the only one.\nIn these days Wheeler is housing more aces than any other place in America.\n\nFrom the Army Air Force the members of the best two squadrons are here:\n\nThe 7th Fighter Squadron aces\nWillard 'Monkey' Buhler with 57 aireal victories,\nEric 'Vampire' Dolphy with 43 kills and\nDiego 'Torrero' Marsalis with 32 victories\nThey are testing a new plane type too, a wonderful looking twinmot fighter, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. The most beautiful plane you ever saw.\n\nThe 44th Fighter Squadron aces are testing another new Army Air Force Fighter Type:\nThe P-47 Thunderbolt. It's surely the biggest single engine fighter in the world.\nIt's commander, Major Ary 'Angel' von Ylmond is a mysterious man. A little bit like a saint. Angel!\nHe is America's top ace with 67 kills.\nWith him at Wheeler:\nDan 'Dragon' Coltrane with 44 victories and\nTerence 'Red Devil' Dix with 36 kills.\n\nThe men of both squads are somewhat strange. Both squads came from New Guinea. It seems that the place changes the minds of men.\nHowever, strange or not, they are great airmen and even greater comrades.\nAnd.... never drink with Major 'Monkey' Buhler....\n\nThe most time in the evenings you spent with the \nMarines from VMF-113. \nRosenberg assigned to you his fourth flight's leader as your instructor for the F4U: \nCapt. Alex 'Archer' Brandt.\n\nAlthough his plane is wearing only four kill markings you quickly learned to respect this man.\nHis plane is wearing only four victory markings and you were astonished why Pat talked about him as his best pilot. \nWhen you heard that he achieved his 'only' four kills with a dive bomber and not with a fighter you became curious. \nHe is nine years older than all the others, but as you quickly learned, a very capable fighter pilot.\nHe was the pilot you heard about, who flew that famous General to his encircled men.\nA real Time Life story.\n\nYou didn't read it, but you should have done.\nThis famous General was nobody else than General Bannert.\nSarah Bannert's father!\n\nYou told Alex the whole story and that you wish to see Sarah again. \nAt the end Alex grined and said that he will take a look at you in the coming days to see, what kind of man you are. Then he will decide if you're worth to get another chance with the general's daughter.\n\nAlex should become a politician. \nAlthough he's lower in rank he has you in his hands.\n\nFor today he gave you the 'order' to train carrier landings with him...\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nLand your new F4U on the Essex.\nBe careful. It's not so easy with it like with the Wildcat.\n\nTime: 10:00\nAltitude: 5000ft\nFlight: Archer- Two\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\n
