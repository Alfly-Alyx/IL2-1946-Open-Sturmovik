Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nBetio Island Airfield, Tarawa Atoll...... \n\nApril 4th, 1943\n\n==================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe Japanese carrier Hiryu sunk.\n\nBut anyway, this was a black day.\nAnd it's not just over.\n\nThe Essex is leaving the battlefield.\nThe Japanese were well prepaired. \nVery well.\nHalf an hour ago we got the report that a second Japanese carrier was sighted. Before we got the exact position, the contact with the reconaissance plane was lost.\n\nTask Group 44.0 faced a very much underestimated enemy who was nearly three times as strong as estimated.\nJapanese fighters were everywhere. \nEverywhere in numbers.\n\nEvery air strike we conducted was opposed by enemy fighters in strength. Our losses were awful.\nMay the Japanese losses been high too, we were badly surprised.\n\nThe main target, to destroy the Japanese capability to launch air strikes from tarawa against our supply shipping wasn't achieved.\nWe lost two desperately needed carriers. The Japanese lost one.\n\nWe ran into a trap. They knew that we were coming and they managed to bring their carriers to the Atoll just in time.\n\nIn these minutes one of the Saratoga's destroyers is reporting a greater number of enemy aircraft flying at low altitude into the direction of our group.\n\nPerhaps we can end this battle with a small surprise.\n\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nFly towards the enemy plane group and attack them.\n\nTime: 17:36\nAltitude:  3000ft\nFlight: Blue Alpha- One\n\nWeather forecast:\nSunny and clear late afternoon.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
