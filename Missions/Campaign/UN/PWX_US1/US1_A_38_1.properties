The new F6F Hellcat.\n\nAt the first moment you were disappointed, bacause you were anxious that it would be like the Wildcat. You just bacame familar with the F4U, which you very much liked and didn't want to make a step back.\nBut when you flew the Hellcat, you recognized it's great potential immediately. \nIt's fast, very fast.\nAnd although it's much looking like the Wildcat, it's by far superior to it.\nIt's a great plane and you love to fly it like you loved the F4U. \nFor the new pilot the F6F is better. It has much more forgiving flight and landing characteristics than the somewhat tricky Corsair.\n\n\nAfter the desaster in the Coral Sea you were given some time to rebuild the squadron.\n\nYou recieved the new planes and new pilots and your squadron was at full strenght again just after ten days.\n\nAfter three weeks since your return from battle the beauty of Oahu makes much of the fear and horror of the war forgotten.\nSomething you have to remember when you're training these young green rookies. \nSoon they will face grim Japanese fighter pilots.\n\nThe training is going on.\nToday ground and ship attack missions flown in strength are on the plan....\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nAttack the anchored ships north of Oahu with bombs.\n\nTime: 15:30\nAltitude: 2000ft\nFlight: Cascade- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nCloudy. Strong winds.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
