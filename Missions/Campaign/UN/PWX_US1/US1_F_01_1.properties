Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++  CLASSIFIED ++++++++++++++\n\nMidway Islands / Kure Atoll\n\nJune 3rd, 1942\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe battle in the Coral Sea south of Guadalcanal went unsatisfying.\nThe sinking of the Zuikaku for the prize of the loss of the Lexington was a bad trade.\nEven if the earlier sinking of the Kaga is taken into account the numerical superiority of the Japanese carrier fleet in the Pacific holds every American operation under pressure.\n\nOur intelligence is estimating that the Japanese Navy is planning to launch an operation against Midway. Admiral Nimitz ordered the remaining carriers to counter that threat.\nAll preperations were made when two days ago an American submarine spotted a Japanese Carrier Group near the Marianas on course to the south.\nTo counter an eventual threat at New Guinea or Australia,the Saratoga was redirected to the Coral Sea, where it shall form up with the Wasp.\n\nNow our force to guard Midway contains only two carriers: The Yorktown and the Enterprise.\n\nBut, will this guard really be needed?\nWith the sighting of the enemy carrier group sailing south it's very questionable that any Japanese naval forces are really on the way to Midway.\n\nAdmiral Nimitz is still believing this. And so you're on board of the Enterprise on the way to Midway.\n\n\nAt around 11 o'clock the group will reach Midway\nTraining flights are on the plan.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nTraining flight along the plotted course to Midway and back.\n\n\nTime: 08:00\nAltitude: 3000ft\nFlight: Patriot- Three\n\nWeather Forecast:\nStrong winds, hazy.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
