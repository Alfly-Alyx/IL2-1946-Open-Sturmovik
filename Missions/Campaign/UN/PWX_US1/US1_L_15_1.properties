Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern Solomons\nGuadalcanal / Tulagi / Savo\nUSS Essex.\n\nAugust 15th, 1943\n\n=================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe battle seems to have ended.\n\nThe last sighting of the enemy carrier showed that it was sailing west.\nThe same with the two carriers in the north. They have set course to the west too.\n\nIf it's the end, then a look at the outcome is allowed.\nAgain a carrier was lost. The Yorktown. The second carrier with this name which sank.\n\nThe Japanese have lost a carrier too and a battleship. Another battleship was reported to be damaged.\n\nTaken into account that we have lost a cruiser too this seems to be a light advantag for us.\nBut if one look a littele deeper onto the facts, the battle eneded not to our favour.\nThe enemy carrier was a smaller one, capable of operating only about 50 planes. The enemy battleship which was sunk was an old and obsolete one.\nThe most favourable point is that Lunga stayed fully intact for the whole time\n\nWould the Essex and the Lexington not have been so close to Guadalcanal, the Japanese would have achieved their goal. \n\nAgain both sides lost many many planes.\nMany pilots, many men, many families beloved sons.\n\nYou made good use of the quiet time.\nThen you were called to your plane.\n\nOne single radar contact sighted.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nIdentyfy the unknown radar contact.\nWeapons free if contact is hostile.\n\nTime: 18:24\nAltitude: 4500ft\nFlight: Cascade- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear late afternoon.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
