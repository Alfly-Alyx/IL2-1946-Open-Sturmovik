Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nPacific Ocean,\n420 miles west of Howland Island\n\nFebruary 6th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nYesterday you were instructed about the ongoing operation.\n\nSince the last autumn the northern coast of New Guinea is occupied by the Japanese.\nIn the last months a fierce battle is raging there.\nThe combined US and Commenwealth forces are trying to keep off the enemy from building up a position at the south coast of New Guinea.\n\nShould the Japanese be able to occupy Port Moresby or  the Milne Region with it's air bases they could launch an operation against Australia.\n\nTo prevent this the continious flow of supplies to the New Guinean front must be kept up.\n\nThis is very difficult, since the Japanese took Tarawa and Wake Island from where their air forces are able to threat our supply convoys to New Guinea.\nEvery week several allied supply ships are beeing sunk by enemy air attacks.\n\nThe Essex is ordered to patrol the supply routes to interdict enemy air activity.\n\nFour supply convoys are on the way to New Guinea at the moment. They are following the Essex group.\nParallel to the Essex group a battleship group is sailing as a surface security force for our carrier.\n\nIn the coming weeks you will help to secure the supply ways to New Guinea.\n\nSince yesterday morning you are flying patrols over our ships...\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nPatrol over the battleship's path.\nYou're free to attack any enemy air activity you encounter.\n\nTime: 05:00\nAltitude: 9000ft\nFlight: Catball- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear morning\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
