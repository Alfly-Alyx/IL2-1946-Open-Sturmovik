Short Attack Wake Island\n
Description Date: October 5, 1943\nLocation: Pacific Ocean, Northeast of Wake Island\nTime: 0545\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Clouds at 5000 feet\nMission: Raid on Wake Island Airfield\n\nBrief:\nThe time has come to get a little payback for what the Japanese did to our boys on Wake Island last year. You have all heard the stories, so I will not repeat them now, but you are to be the first American forces to return there since the defeat and occupation by the Japanese Army.\n\nYou will take off just after first light and stay low to avoid the Japanese radar as long as possible. The SBDs will go in first from west to east and make their run down the channel between the Islands of Wake. The fighters will follow and strafe the AAA positions and any aircraft on the airfield. You can rejoin to the southeast of the Island and form up for the return to the ship. We will plan the next raid after we can evaluate the results of this one, so we will look forward to seeing how it goes.\n\nPlease keep in mind that you are very likely to encounter Japanese fighters this morning, and we have replaced the red border with blue on our "star & bar" insignia just to make sure there is no room for confusion. If you guys see any red "meatballs" out there, don't get buck fever and let that trigger finger freeze up!\n\n             ** Select skin F6F3_VF9.bmp **\n
