Short Raid on Roi\n
Description Date: December 4, 1943\nLocation: Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands\nTime: 0600\nWeather: Scattered Clouds above 3000 feet\nMission: Combat Air Patrol / Airfield Strafing Attack\n\nBrief:\nThe Marines had a very difficult time at "Bloody Tarawa", but we did what we could to help. They have finally cleaned out the last of the resistance from the Island so we are heading back to Pearl.\n\nOn our way back, we will stop by the Marshall Islands to pay a quick visit to Kwajalein Atoll. This is the central base for Japanese Army and Navy fighters in the area and an invasion is scheduled for the near future. With that in mind, we will launch a strike to take out whatever planes and shipping we can catch in the open.\n\nFighters will rendezvous with the SBDs & TBFs en route to the target. The first group will provide high cover and the second group will strafe ground positions ahead of the bombers to keep the AAA gunners occupied while they make their runs.\n\nThere will be a rescue submarine on station at grid coordinates L-23 if you have to ditch. This is approximately 15 miles east northeast of the Island. Take off time is 0900. Any questions? No?... OK, let's go.\n\n        ** Select skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n
