Short HVAR Rocket Test\n
Description Date: June 10, 1943\nLocation: Barber's Point, Oahu Hawaii\nTime: 0800\nWeather: Scattered clouds at 3000 feet\nMission: Experimental HVAR rocket test\n\nBrief:\nI know you have all been enjoying your time here in Hawaii, but we have some real work to do today. A couple of our Hellcats have been fitted with mounting rails for the new experimental 5" High Velocity Aircraft Rockets. You guys are going to get to give them a try and submit your evaluations on their effectiveness and ease of use.\n\nImmediately after takeoff, you will proceed northwest up the coast and look for a grounded freighter on a small island just off shore. There is a lighthouse right next to it where observers from the Armory are waiting to see the results of the test firing. \n\nAfter expending your rockets, you will proceed east and land on the USS Essex for debriefing. Double check the electrical connections and the fuses in the arming switches before you take off and make sure you know where your launch button is on the instrument panel. I will see you aboard the Essex in about an hour... a piper Scout plane is due in to pick me up for the ride out to the ship shortly.\n\n              ** Select skin F6F3_43.bmp **\n
