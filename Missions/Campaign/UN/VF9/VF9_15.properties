Description Date: September 1, 1943\nLocation: Pacific Ocean, approximately 150 miles northeast of Marcus Island\nTime: 0500\nWeather: Scattered Clouds and Low Fog\nMission: Bomber Escort to Marcus Island\n\nBrief:\nGood morning gentlemen! The time has come to take the war to the Japanese and show them they are vulnerable to the power of the United States Navy! You may have heard that this is not a very important target, but that is not true. This is a perfect opportunity for us to test our tactics and more importantly, to test the Hellcat in combat. Marcus Island is a major enemy base and even though we have already gone over the AAA defenses at length, we still do not know what types of aircraft are based there. You will need to be ready for anything to happen.\n\nThe general plan is exactly what we have been practicing all this time in training. The SBDs will go in first and the fighter escort will stay above to make sure any defending fighters cannot get to our bombers. If there are no enemy aircraft to deal with, the fighters will dive in and strafe the AAA positions while the bombers make their getaway. You guys are as ready as you are going to get so be careful joining up in the dark, and we will see you all when you get back.\n\n             ** Select skin F6F3_43.bmp **\n
