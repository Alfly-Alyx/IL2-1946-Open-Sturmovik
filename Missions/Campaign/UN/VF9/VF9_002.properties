Name VF9 Training 2
Short Gunnery Training\n
Description Date: May 18th, 1942\nLocation: Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia\nTime: 1400\nMission: Gunnery Practice\n\nBriefing:\nOK boys, time for some fun today. You finally get to fire those .50 calibre guns on your birds and see what they were really made for.\n\nAfter takeoff, you will follow your waypoints and rendezvous with the R4D tow plane that is pulling a target glider. The standard procedure is to approach from above and to the side. That way, you can be sure you do not hit the tow plane when you fire at the target. Whichever one of you gets the most hits on the glider will get a pass to go into town this weekend!\n\nAfter that, we have some ground targets set up at the little emergency strip located just to the west of here. There are target markers laid out on the ground for you to follow so be sure to watch for them. We have personnel already there to grade your strafing runs. I will see you when you get back & then the next pair will give it a try. Good Luck.\n\n                    ** Select skin "F4F3_USN" **\n
