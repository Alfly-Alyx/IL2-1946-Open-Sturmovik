Name VF9 22
Short Tarawa Close Air Support\n
Description Date: November 20, 1943\nLocation: Just South of Betio Island, Tarawa\nTime: 1000\nWeather: Scattered Clouds at 1000 meters\nArming: 2x 500lb bombs\nMission: Close Air Support\n\nBrief:\nYou will assist the Marines landing on Betio Island. They are under heavy fire from concealed enemy positions, and the tide has stranded many of the Higgins Boats on the reef. They are getting torn to pieces by the enemy mortar, machine gun and artillery fire so take out any enemy bunkers you can identify.\n\nThe worst of the fire is coming from the airfield perimeter and directed towards the troops landing near the jetty on the north shore. The destroyers have attempted to mark the enemy locations with phosphorus shells so you should see gray smoke in the area to indicate the hot spots.\n\nYou will be armed with 2 500lb bombs which should make quite an impression on the enemy bunkers. Do not drop your ordnance within 500 yards of the beaches as they are packed with Marines. If you see any return fire from positions on or near the shore, strafing runs with machine guns only are authorized. That's it so let's get going!\n\n        ** Select skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n
