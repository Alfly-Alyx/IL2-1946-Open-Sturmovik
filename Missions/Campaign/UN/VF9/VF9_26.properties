Short Return to Roi\n
Description Date: January 29, 1944\nLocation: Kwajalein Atoll, Marshall Islands\nTime: 0545\nWeather:  Heavy Clouds with base at 4000 feet\nMission: Combat Air Patrol\n\nBrief:\nWelcome back to combat operations gentlemen, I hope you enjoyed your time off in Hawaii. This will be your first mission with the "Fast Carrier" Task Group 58.2. We are returning to Kwajalein Atoll for another 2 days of ground attacks against the Japanese airfield on Roi. Although our first raid on this enemy stronghold was effective, they have continued to maintain a strong fighter force around Kwajalein that threatens our Carrier operations further north.\n\nYour primary mission today is the destruction of enemy aircraft on the airfield at Roi. You will refuse air to air combat unless absolutely essential, and focus on the task at hand. The weather is not great, so it would be a good idea to keep one group above the cloud cover to guard against enemy fighters while the other group executes the strafing runs.\n\nMan your planes, take off time is 0630 sharp.\n\n \n        ** Select skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n
