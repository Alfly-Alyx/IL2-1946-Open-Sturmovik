Short Saipan Raid\n
Description Date: February 23, 1944\nLocation: Southeast of the Marianas Islands\nTime: 1600\nWeather: Overcast with Rain\nMission: Ground Attack\n\nBrief:\nAll right guys, one more time! This will be our last mission together before the Essex heads home for refitting. We have completed our tour and it is time for a break, but don't get complacent just yet. The Cat O'9s have tallied a respectable score over the last year, and we have one last chance to add to it.\n\nToday we will raid the Marianas Islands and try to take out as many enemy planes as we can in preparation for the next amphibious invasion. The weather is lousy and it is raining, so all we can do is hope for a break in the clouds over the target area.\n\nOur target is the airfield on the southern tip of Saipan. We should find plenty of aircraft on the ground, and with this weather it is doubtful that we will see much in the way of airborne opposition. We have managed to scrape together a few of the 5" HVAR rockets and those of you armed with them will be making your strafing runs first. Maintain a flight of fighters as high cover until you are sure there are no enemy fighters to contend with, and then you are all free to beat up whatever ground targets you can find.\n\n              ** Select Skin F6F3_VF9 **\n
