Name VF9 10
Short Anti-Submarine Patrol\n
Description \nDate: November 11, 1942\nLocation: Atlantic Ocean\nTime: 1100\nWeather: Good visibility with scattered clouds\nArming: 2x 100lb bombs\nMission: Submarine Patrol\n\nBrief:\nThis is the first time I have had the pleasure of speaking with most of you since the Armastice was signed this morning, so .... Congratulations! You have all done an outstanding job and our mission has been sucessfully completed. I am sorry to say that we have learned a few hard facts about our business, but I hope that our missing companions will return when this is all sorted out.\n\nAt the present moment, a pack of submarines is shadowing the Fleet as we withdraw. They are most likely German and obviously have not agreed to the Armastice, so we must do what is necessary to protect ourselves. You will be taking turns launching on patrol in search of these Wolfpacks. We will put up individual elements of 2 fighters armed with bombs and as many SBDs as we can keep in the air. If you spot any submarines, keep them busy with what you have and call for the bombers on the R/T. The subs usually surface to fire their torpedos, so they should be vulnerable to a skip-bombing attack. I know this is a new technique for most of you, but the general idea is to make a broadside run at high speed and minimum altitude with a 2 second delay on your frags. Release about 100 yards from the target and pull up and away. Remember that they have a Flak cannon on the bow, so it would be wise to throw in a few jinks and kick in some rudder on the way out. That's all for now, so check the flight schedule on the way out and I will see you around the ship.\n\n           * Select skin F4F4_Torch *\n\n
