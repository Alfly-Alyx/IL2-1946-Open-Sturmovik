Short Truk Recon\n
Description Date: February 17, 1944\nLocation: Truk Atoll, Central Pacific\nTime: 1600\nWeather: Clear\nMission: Recon Flight\n\nBrief:\nHello gentlemen, come on in and have a seat. I have selected you two as volunteers for a special mission this evening. After reviewing your personel files, I see that you both have training in photo reconnaissance. That makes you volunteers, and what we need is a few medium level oblique camera shots of the enemy airfields on Moen & Eten Islands.\n\nThe enemy fighter strips have taken a real beating today so we don't expect any opposition at this point. Your planes are spotted and ready for takeoff and you already know how to operate the camera equipment on board. This will be the last sortie of the day, so you shouldn't have any other traffic in the landing pattern when you return. We will see you in the wardroom for dinner when you get back.\n\n              ** Select Skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n\n
