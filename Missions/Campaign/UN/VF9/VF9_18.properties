Short Raid on Rabaul\n
Description Date: November 11, 1943\nLocation: North of Bougainville Island, Bismark Sea\nTime: 0700\nWeather: Low Overcast with Scattered Showers \nMission: Raid on Rabaul Harbor and Airfields\n\nBrief:\nGood morning guys. It's a beautiful day to go flying, isn't it? I know you have all heard by now that the guys from the Saratoga took a real beating on the 5th over Simpson Harbor, but we are going back again anyway. The Japanese Navy is assembling a task force there at the moment for a counterattack against our invasion forces on Bougainville. Since most of our own ships are assembling for the invasion of Tarawa Atoll, it is up to us to prevent the Japanese task force from making it out of Rabaul.\n\nAll available fighters will escort our entire strike force at first light to the target area. Primary targets are Japanese Naval vessels. The fighter escort will stay with the bombers all the way to target and strafe any likely targets as well. Do not break away from your escort duty to chase the Japanese fighters. They will try to sucker you away from your task so they can pick you apart one by one.\n\nWhile you are all away, we have arranged for the Corsairs from VF-17 to provide air cover over the fleet, so you should expect to see them airborne when you return.\n\n        ** Select skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n
