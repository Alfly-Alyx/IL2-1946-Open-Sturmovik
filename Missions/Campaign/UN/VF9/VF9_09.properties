Short USAAF Deployment\n
Description Date: November 10, 1942\nLocation\n Casablanca\nTime: 1300\nWeather: Good visibility with scattered clouds\nMission: Combat Air Patrol\n\nBrief: All right boys, we have to keep up the pressure on the Vichy Air Force. The Army flyboys are planning to launch their P-40s from the USS Chenango and fly them to the airfield at Port Lyautey which is still very much in dispute. The ground echelon was only just now able to reach the airfield and some of the heaviest fighting has been in this area.\n\nYour mission is to make sure the Vichy fighter pilots cannot disrupt the transfer of Army fighters to their new base.\n\n           * Select skin F4F4_Torch *\n\n
