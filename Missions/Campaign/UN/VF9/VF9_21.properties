Description Date: November 19, 1943\nLocation: Just South of Betio Island, Tarawa\nTime: 0900\nWeather: Scattered Clouds at 500 meters\nMission:Fleet CAP\n\nBrief: You are assigned fleet cover while SBDs strike enemy artillery positions on Betio Island. I know you all think it's a boring assignment to fly circles around the carrier, but you never know what the Japanese are up to. They may try and sneak a surprise attack in on us while we are occupied elsewhere. Maintain your patrol pattern and watch out for enemy aircraft attempting to approach the fleet at low altitude.\n\n        ** Select skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n
