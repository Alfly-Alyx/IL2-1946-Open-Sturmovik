Short Bomber Escort\n
Description Date: November 9, 1942\nLocation: Casablanca\nTime: 1700\nWeather: Good visibility with scattered clouds\nMission: SBD Bomber Escort\n\nBrief:\nAs most of you are aware, the French Battleship Jean Bart is still firing at our fleet from Casablanca Harbor. The ship was never completed prior to the beginning of hostilities with Germany, and she was moved here for safekeeping by the Vichy Government. I am afraid she is not going to be safe after all.\n\nWe have sent a number of sorties against her today but so far, despite a couple of good hits, she still has one main turret firing. We will try one more time today to see if we can put her out of action.   \n\nTwo flights of fighters will escort two flights of SBDs armed with 1000 lb bombs. One direct hit should do the job with those babies, so let's make it happen this time!\n\nBombers will go in from 10,000 feet and make their runs while the fighters watch for enemy fighters. If the air is clear, one section of fighters can strafe the flak positions to keep their heads down while the bombers make their way off target. \n\nBe advised that the wind direction has changed due to a weather front moving through the area. We have come about and you will be taking off to the west. Target bearing is to the southwest. That's all, so get going.\n\n           * Select skin F4F4_Torch *\n\n
