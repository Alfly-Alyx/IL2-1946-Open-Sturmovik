Short Short Field Landing Practice\n
Description Date: May 15th, 1942\nLocation: Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia\nTime: 0900\nMission: Short Field Carrier Landing Practice\n\nBriefing:\nI am glad to say that training has been going well and all of you have transitioned into the F4F fighter without too much trouble. We have set up a practice landing area just to the south of here, and we will be taking turns shooting carrier style landings to get warmed up for our carrier qualificaion.\n\nNumber four will go first. You must land between the white and red markers on the runway and come to a stop within the designated area before taking off again and returning to the field here. The LSO's are standing by to grade your performance, so make it nice. \n\nI'll see you when you get back to go over any problems you may have with the aircraft and then we will continue with our training syllabus.\n\n             ** Select skin "F4F3_USN"  **\n
