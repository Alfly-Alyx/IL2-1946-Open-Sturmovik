Short Night Landing Qualification\n
Description Date: June 28, 1943\nLocation: Barber's Point, Oahu, Hawaii\nTime: 1900\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Darkness\nMission: Night Carrier Landing Qualification\n\nBrief:\nGood evening... This is the night you have all been eagerly looking forward to. You will prove your mettle by landing your Hellcat aboard ship in the dark. This exercise is dangerous, but necessary. There may come a time when you have no choice but to make a nighttime landing and the most likely scenario is that it will be after combat, you will be dog tired and worn out and there will be no lights aboard ship in the combat zone. This is your chance to do it right while you are relaxed, calm, and in friendly waters. Next time it may not be so easy.\n\nYou should be able to line up on the white wake of the Carrier or even the wake of the plane guard destroyer that will be right alongside. Then you MUST trap in the first set of wires. After landing on the moving carrier at sea, you will be required to take off again and return to the harbor here. You will then land aboard the Essex which is anchored just south of our airfield. As you fly into the harbor, we have a guard boat stationed at your IP for the final approach. If you can fly over this ship at 1000 feet and 90 knots with your gear and flaps down, you should be able to line up on the carrier and bring it in for a straight approach. Take your time and if you get a wave off, just come around and try it again. The ship will keep the lights on for you as long as it takes....This time. Good Luck.\n\n          ** Select skin F6F3_43.bmp **\n
