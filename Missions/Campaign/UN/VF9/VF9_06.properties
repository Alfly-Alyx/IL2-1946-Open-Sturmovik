Name VF9 6
Short Raider Intercept\n
Description Date: November 9, 1942\nLocation: Casablanca\nTime: 1000\nWeather: Good visibility with scattered clouds\nMission: Combat Air Patrol\n\nBrief:\nI need two volunteers to go on an unscheduled patrol over the landing beach in 15 minutes. The Phantom Strafer was reported again as soon as we cleared the area this morning, so I am sending a single element in right after our 2nd strike turns back for the ship. That gives you about 15 minutes to get your gear and man your planes.\n\nYou must maintain radio silence and fly along the beach at about 2000 feet and watch below for the strafer. Let's see if we can get this guy this time.\n\nAll right, you two in the back with your hands raised, get going and bring me back some good news!\n\n                    ** Select skin F4F4_Torch **   \n\n
