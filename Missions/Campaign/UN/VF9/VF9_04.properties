Name VF9 4
Short Airfield Attack\n
Description Date: November 8, 1942\nLocation: Casablanca\nTime: 1700\nWeather: Good visibility with scattered clouds\nMission: CAP / Airfield Attack  \n\nBriefing:\nI know you are all tired and some of you have already flown three missions today, but we are going up one more time. We have made some progress in the Cazes area, but we still have to prevent the aircraft at Fedala from launching a counterattack. Our reconnaissance section reports the Vichy Air Force has a group of Douglas bombers ready to launch against our fleet.\n\nYou will preceed a flight of SBDs assigned to attack the airfield. Your fighters will keep the AAA positions busy while the dive bombers take out the aircraft on the ground. It is essential that they not be allowed to take off, or you may not have a ship to come back to.\n\nIt would be a good idea to hurry and get airborne now so you can make it back before dark. With all the submarines lurking in the area, I can assure you there won't be any lights on deck after dark.\n\n                   ** Select skin F4F4_Torch **\n\n
