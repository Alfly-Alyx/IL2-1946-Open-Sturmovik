Name Cat O'9 Tales
Description \nWelcome to the United States Navy. Now that you have your "Wings of Gold", you are all officially 1st Lieutenants and Naval Aviators.\n\nYou lucky gentlemen here with me now will be assigned to VF-9, the Cat O'9s Squadron.\n\nWhen you arrive in the combat zone in the near future, remember that your unit symbol, the Cat O'9 Tails, is an instrument of the United States Navy designed to punish wrongdoers and inflict pain upon those unlucky enough to stray along the path of evil. You have been thoroughly trained to fulfill this assignment and proven your ability to do what is required.\n\nYour next stop will be fighter training at Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. Good Luck!\n\n
