Description Date: February 17, 1944\nLocation: Truk Atoll, Central Pacific\nTime: 0900\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Clouds at 3000 feet\nMission: Fighter Sweep\n\nBrief:\nGentlemen, we have arrived at Truk Atoll.... "The Gibraltar of the Pacific". The main anchorage is located just to the west of our current position, and it is the largest Japanese Naval Base in the central Pacific. We are here to make sure it is not a safe haven for the enemy any longer!\n\nWe will be launching fighter sweeps all morning and targeting Japanese fighters in the area to clear the way for the dive bombers. This is just the type of mission you have all been grousing about not getting to fly, so now is your chance to shoot down those Zekes you've been dreaming about. Those of you who are assigned CAP over the fleet will be on fighter sweeps later in the day, so don't worry about missing your chance.\n\nOnce we are able to neutralize the fighter cover over the enemy Naval positions, the  dive bombers and torpedo planes will be able to do their work without interference. Then we can make sure that the Japanese Navy is no longer a threat to our surface fleet. Let's go get some!\n\n              ** Select Skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n\n
