Description Date: November 8, 1942\nLocation: Casablanca\nTime: 1100 hours\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Clouds\nArming: 2x 100lb bombs\nMission: Combat Air Patrol\n\nBriefing:\nI hope you all had a chance to grab a sandwich, because some of you will be taking off again right away. We need to provide air cover for the transport ships and keep our eyes out for any threats to the beachhead. If you spot any enemy ships trying to break out of the harbor, it is imperative that you do everything you can to stop them.\n\nYou also need to keep an eye out for enemy aircraft. The Vichy Air Force has been quite active this morning and we have numerous reports of stiff resistance in all sectors. Although most of the damage to our fighters on the first mission today was from ground fire, some of our boys are missing after getting into dogfights with the French fighters. You know what to do, so let's get moving now.\n\n          ** Select skin F4F4_Torch **\n\n
