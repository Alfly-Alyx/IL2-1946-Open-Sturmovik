Short Return to Wake Island\n
Description Date: October 6, 1943\nLocation: Northeast of Wake Island \nTime: 0800\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Clouds at 4000 feet\nMission: Combat Air Patrol\n\nBrief:\nAs you guys already know, yesterday's raid was a success, but we didn't come out unscathed. I have discussed the results with the other carriers in the task force and altogether we have confirmed 22 Zekes shot down and 12 Hellcats lost. About half of our guys that didn't make it back were lost to the AAA on the Island. We have destroyers searching for a few of them, so we are hoping that they may still turn up.\n\nToday's mission will be a little different from yesterday as we will only send 2 flights of fighters to attack the airfield and you will join up with a flight from the Lexington en route. We are fairly confident that we have severely damaged the enemy's ability to fight back, but that is no reason to take chances. They may still be able to put up a few flights of fighters if they spot you on radar. If you do not encounter any Zekes, strafe the airfield and try to destroy as many aircraft on the ground as possible. We will most likely pull the Task Force out after this mission, so let's make it count!\n\n             ** Select skin F6F3_VF9.bmp **\n
