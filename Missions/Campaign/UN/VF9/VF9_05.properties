Short Airfield Attack\n
Description Date: November 9, 1942\nLocation: Casablanca\nTime: 0700\nWeather: Good visibility with scattered clouds\nArming: 2x 100lb bombs \nMission: Airfield Attack\n\nBriefing:\nGood morning boys, I hope you all slept well because we are in for another action packed day.\n\nThis mission will be a low level strafing attack on Cazes airfield. We will get an early start and try to eliminate whatever opposition is still left from yesterday.\n\nYour first priority is to take out any enemy aircraft left intact at the airfield. Secondary targets are the antiaircraft positions, and of course you will engage any fighters you might encounter in the air. We have sifted through the action reports from yesterday, and there were numerous encounters with the French pilots flying the Hawk 75s. We intercepted a few  Pz63 reconnaisance planes but we still have not seen much in the way of the French Dewoitines.\n\nOh, by the way... if any of you happen to spot a single dark colored fighter strafing the beach, make sure you catch the bastard. The Army guys have reported that a lone black fighter keeps showing up and raining lead on them every time there are no Navy fighters overhead. He is becoming a real nuisance, so they have asked us to try and get rid of this sneaky "Phantom Strafer" for them. \n\n             ** Select Skin F4F4_Torch **\n
