Short Tarawa Close Air Support 2\n
Description Date: November 21, 1943\nLocation: Betio Island, Tarawa\nTime: 1030\nWeather: Scattered Clouds at 3000 feet\nMission: Close Air Support\n\nBrief:\nThe Marines are having a hell of a time digging the Japanese out of their bunkers on Betio Island. There is a large enemy complex in the center of the island just southeast of the airfield that will require some close air support to eleminate. The Navy ships sitting offshore are having trouble taking it out. Since the trajectory of their guns is so flat, the shells just skip over the emplacements or go right over the island. SBDs will be armed with 1000lb bombs and fighters will strafe ahead of them to take out any exposed AAA positions. Your target will be marked by white phosphorus artillery shells so look for the grey smoke. The friendly positions should have deployed white cloth panels in front of their positions so you can see their locations and avoid firing into them.\n\nTake off time is 1100 so if there are no questions, man your planes!\n\n        ** Select skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n
