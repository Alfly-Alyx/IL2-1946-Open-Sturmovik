Short Escort SBDs to Tarawa.\n
Description Date: November 18, 1943\nLocation: South of Betio Island, Tarawa\nTime: 1100\nWeather: Cloudy with limited visibility\nMission: Escort SBDs to Tarawa\n\nBrief:\nOK boys, we got an easy job this time. The Marines are going to land on Betio Island tomorrow and we are going to soften it up for them. We have a Battleship and a couple of Destroyers shelling the Island, and they are doing a fine job of it. As soon as their barrage lifts, we will go in with dive bombers and look for anything that might be left. The airfield on the Island is the only one within range, so we don't anticipate any enemy fighter cover today.\n\nEscort fighters will strafe AAA positions while the bombers drop ordnance on any bunkers that are visable. Let's take care of business guys, this should be a piece of cake compared to Rabaul!\n\n        ** Select skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n
