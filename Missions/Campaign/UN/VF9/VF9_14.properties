Name VF9 14
Short Akutan Zero\n
Description Date: July 9, 1943 \nLocation: Barber's Point, Oahu, Hawaii\nTime: 1000\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Clouds at 3000 feet\nMission: Zero Test Flight\n\nBrief:\nGood Morning guys... I am sure some of you have heard the rumors of a captured Japanese Zero that was recovered in Alaska and taken to San Diego for flight testing. Well, I have a surprise for you. Not only are the rumors true, but that Zero has been brought here by ship and the mechanics have just finished prepping it for flight! You guys will have a chance to fly the "Akutan Zero" and even fire the guns at an experimental rocket powered target drone we have been testing. A word of warning about your targets today boys... the fuel in those things has a habit of blowing up if you hit it right, so don't get too close before you pull the trigger, OK? Just fall in behind the B-17s as they fly over the base and they will drop the drones for you.\n\nAll of you need to get over to the hangar area and get a pre-flight cockpit check before you can take it up. Since we are scheduled to ship out to the combat zone soon, the Brass thinks it is a good opportunity to let you become familiar with the handling qualities of the primary enemy fighter type. The chances are good that the next time you see this aircraft, it will be with a Nippon pilot at the controls trying to blow your head off!\n\nThe word from the test pilots is that it climbs and turns like there's no tomorrow, but the controls get extremely stiff at high speed and it is slower in a dive than the Hellcat. You all need to go see for yourself, just be careful and try to bring it back in one piece so everyone else can get a turn.\n\n     ** Select skin Akutan_Zero.bmp **\n
