Short Night Intercept\n
Description Date: November 20, 1943\nLocation: South of Betio Island, Tarawa\nTime: 1830\nWeather: Clear & Dark\nMission: Night Bomber Intercept\n\nBrief:\nThe radar operators have picked up a flight of enemy aircraft inbound towards the carrier group. Since the Japanese have not been able to get close to us during the day, they have resorted to night attacks.\n\nWe have not recieved our dedicated night fighters yet, but we have to try and prevent these intruders from reaching the carriers with what we have available. One element will take off immediately and try and intercept them to the south of the carrier group just outside of the defensive fire umbrella.\n\nI am afraid we cannot turn on running lights due to the danger from enemy submarines in the area, so your night landing qualifications are going to come in handy tonight. Remember your instrument scan and watch out for one another. It is easy to get vertigo up there on a dark night like this, so you will have to trust your instruments and ignore what your body is telling you. Take off is at 1900 hours, so we will see you back here for breakfast.\n\n        ** Select skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n
