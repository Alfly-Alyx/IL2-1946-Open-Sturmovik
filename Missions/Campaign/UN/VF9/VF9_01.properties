Description Date: November 8, 1942\nLocation: Straight of Gibraltar\nTime: 0630 \nWeather: Hazy with ground fog\nPlane/Arming: F4F-4 with .50 cal Machine Guns\nMission: Combat Air Patrol\n\nBriefing:\nGood morning Gentlemen... As you have already heard, we are now steaming offshore from Morocco in North Africa. Today is Dog Day for "Operation Torch" and the time has come to open a third front against the Axis powers. That is why we are all here. At precisely 0700 hours, you will take off from the carrier and assist the Army troops going ashore. \n\nYour specific assignment is to provide cover for the Navy SBDs attacking enemy fortifications in the landing area. We have reports that the Vichy French troops are resisting the invasion heavily, and I know many of you are concerned about shooting at our former allies. We have all read stories about Eddie Rickenbacker and the Lafayette Escadrille, but I assure you that they will shoot you if you don't get them first.\n\nWe will be heading for Cazes airfield, so keep your eyes peeled for enemy fighters. They have quite a few American Hawk 75s and French Dewoitine 520s available. Now I don't have to remind you guys to stick with your sections and stay in pairs. Good luck to you all!\n\n               ** Select skin F4F4_Torch **\n
