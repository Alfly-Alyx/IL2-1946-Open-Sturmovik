Short Truk SBD Escort\n
Description Date: February 17, 1944\nLocation: Truk Atoll, Central Pacific\nTime: 1300\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Clouds\nMission: Ground Attack & Escort\n\nBrief:\nWe have begun launching attack missions with single flights of Hellcats accompanying an equal number of SBDs as quickly as the fighters can be refueled and re-armed.\n\nI have a bonus for you guys this time around as well... Your planes are currently armed with 6 High Velocity Aerial Rockets each. These rockets should make the job of knocking out ground targets a little easier, so we will expect you fighter guys to go in on the target first and at least take out the AAA positions before the dive bombers make their runs. I seem to recall that a couple of you got to test these when we were training in Hawaii, but for those who have not, fire the rockets in a shallow dive and pull off target at no less than 500 feet!\n\nYour target for this mission is a sea-plane base marked on the map here. There are 15 to 20 float planes reported to be based there, so the priority is to take out as many of these as you can first. Obviously if you encounter any airborne bandits they will need to be dealt with as well. That's it for now, Good Luck.\n\n              ** Select Skin F6F3_VF9 **\n\n\n
