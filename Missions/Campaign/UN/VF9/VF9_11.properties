Description \nDate: March 25, 1943\nLocation: Gulf of Paria, Venezuela\nTime: 1000\nWeather: Scattered Clouds at 3000 feet\nMission: Carrier Shakedown\n\nBrief:\nIt just occurred to me that this is your first official flight briefing aboard the newly commissioned USS Essex. Since we have been training in our new Hellcat fighters and worked through carrier qualification, you have all done an outstanding job and adjusted splendidly. Since the weather is CAVU and the Hellcat has a lower landing speed than the Wildcat, I don't forsee any difficulties with launching and trapping today.\n\nWe are relatively safe here in the Gulf of Paria, so we have arranged for a local fishing boat towing a barge to provide you with a target for some strafing practice. They are currently located just to our northeast, but make sure you approach from a 45 degree angle so we don't have any ricochets striking their boat.\n\nAfter your gunnery runs, return and land on deck. The LSO's will be grading your approach and landing from this point on, so make it nice for them.\n\n                  ** Select skin "F6F3_Early"  **\n
