Short Battleship Battle\n
Description Date: November 10, 1942\nLocation: Casablanca\nTime: 0800\nWeather: Good visibility with scattered clouds\nMission: SBD Bomber Escort\n\nBrief:\nGood Morning Boys! \n\nWe got some good hits on the Jean Bart yesterday evening and put her guns out of action for a while, but I am afraid this is one stubborn target. The foreward main turret has resumed firing at us and we will be going back one more time.\n\nIn addition to escorting the SBDs, there is an ammunition train reported in the station which may be bringing in more shells for her main guns. If the Battleship has no ammunition, she can't continue firing so you should take care of that once the bombers have done their work. Be careful about secondary explosions and don't press your strafing runs in too close. A few of our missing pilots seem to have bought the farm by not pulling out of their dive soon enough and running right into the target. Both flights of fighters will strafe ground targets before returning to the ship with the bombers. Let's do it !\n\n           * Select skin F4F4_Torch *\n\n
