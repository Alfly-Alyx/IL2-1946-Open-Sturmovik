Short SBD Campaign SBD C8\n
Description October 15, 1942\nTime: 0535\nWeather: Good\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 4 x SBD-3\nLoadout: 3 x 500 pound bombs\nTarget: Damaged submarine\nTarget location: BN/27\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 4,500 feet\n\nEnsign Walden drew the short straw and had to pull the early morning recon flight for our squadron.  He took off 40 minutes ago and has already reported a target.  Two Japanese submarines are in the middle of sector BN/27.  It appears one of them is damaged and undergoing extensive repairs.  This may be the submarine that put a torpedo into the Heavy Cruiser Dayton two days ago.  The escort vessels certainly dropped enough depth charges trying to get that sub.\n\nEnsign Walden reported seeing bright fire between the subs.  Our guess is that means they are trying to weld something to repair the sub.  The damaged sub may not be able to dive, so this is a great chance to take out at least one sub, maybe two!\n\nFly 315 degrees to reach the target.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Sink at least one submarine\n
