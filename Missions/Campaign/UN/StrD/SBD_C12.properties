Short SBD Campaign SBD C12\n
Description October 30, 1942\nTime: 0448\nWeather: Good\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 12 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 1 x 1,600 pound bomb\nTarget: Heavy Cruiser Rodan\nTarget location: BT/29\nDistance to target: 35 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nI know its darn early, but you guys have been griping for days about not seeing any action.  Well I have great news for ya.  Last night the Heavy Cruiser Rodan was spotted by a long range PBY operating out of Port Stanmere.  She was about 400 miles from our position last night at 2000 hours.  We altered course at that time to intercept.   The Rodan is now only 50 miles away and headed towards us!\n\nShe is operating alone and is acting as a surface raider, much like the Germans intended to use the Bismark.  Make sure she joins the Bismark at the bottom of the sea!\n\nThe Rodan should be in sector BT/29.  Make your heading 025 degrees.  Good luck gentlemen.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Sink the Rodan\n
