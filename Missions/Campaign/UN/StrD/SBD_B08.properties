Name StraightDownB8
Short SBD Campaign Mission B8\n
Description May 18, 1942\nTime: 1057\nWeather: Poor\nClouds: 2,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 2 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Japanese artillery positions on Mt. Tapotchau\nTarget location: BR/53\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\nBomb Delay: One second\n\nThree batteries of enemy artillery have been set up on the heights of Mt. Tapotchau.  From that location, they can shell every position we hold on the island.  The army wants us to destroy as much of that artillery as we can.  \n\nExpect a fair amount of AAA.  Those guns will be out in the open on top of that mountain and they will certainly be well protected by AAA.  Expect enemy aircraft to be protecting that position as well.  \n\nAs you all know, the ship suffered some minor damage in the torpedo attack this morning.  We were already low on ordnance and spare aircraft parts before the attack, but we had to flood the starboard magazine and the aircraft workshop to extinguish a fire and avoid an explosion.  Our supply of bombs and spare parts is now critical and we can't repair the aircraft damaged in this morning's attack.  We can only put up 6 SBDs split into three flights.  All flights are to drop their bombs and get out.  We can't afford to lose any pilots or planes.\n\nFlight 1 will attack the closest battery (most southern and furthest from the peak).  Flight 2 will attack the battery furthest to the east.  Flight 3 will attack the northern battery near the peak.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the enemy artillery\n
