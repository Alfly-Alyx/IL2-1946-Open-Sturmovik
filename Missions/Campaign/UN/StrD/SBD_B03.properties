Short SBD Campaign Mission B3\n
Description May 16, 1942\nTime: 1053\nWeather: Hazy\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 2 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Hidden Japanese base\nTarget location: BR/54 (northern edge of forest)\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\nBomb Delay: Zero seconds\n\nFirst of all, good job on bustin' up the Japanese armor this morning.  We lost a lot of our own tanks and trucks, but once you guys dropped your eggs and took out a few of theirs, the guys on the ground were able to hold off the attack.  \n\nThings are by no means going our way on the ground, but things are better than they were at first light.  I have a feeling we are going to be damn busy the next few days supporting the Army, so grab some shut eye and food whenever you have the chance, but that ain't gonna be right now.  We are going back up as lady luck has decided to smile on us this morning.  \n\nIt looks like we know where the hidden Japanese base is.  One of our recon flights spotted a fire in the clearing on the northern edge of the forest.  Against all orders they made a low-level pass and saw that a Japanese fuel truck ran into a tree and caught on fire.  They also saw a few tents hidden under the trees in the same area.  That was 20 minutes ago, so we need you guys to get in the air and attack before they have a chance to move.\n\nWe are sending up two flights to pound the base and one flight of Wildcats for air cover.\n\nJust to let you know, one of our recon planes spotted a Japanese plane about 150 miles north of the island.  The Jap plane was a carrier-based aircraft so we can expect company in the air, probably tomorrow.\n\nMake your course 040 degrees.  Fly up the road on the west side of the island until you get to the northernmost forest.  Look for the small clearing (lots of sand in the clearing).  You may also still see the fire.  Flight 1 will target the near side of the clearing and flight 2 the far side of it.  You are under strict orders to attack the base.  Our guys on the ground desperately need us to hit that base hard!  Ignore AAA and any targets of opportunity - hit that base!\n\nIt is unlikely that you will see any vehicles or tents hidden in the trees so just target the entire area around the clearing.  So far we have encountered little in the way of AAA, so pray that your luck holds out.  \n\nOne last thing.  Ensign Collier!  Your crew chief wants me to tell you that the next time you barf all over your cockpit YOU will be cleaning it up.  \n\nDismissed!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the hidden Japanese base\n
