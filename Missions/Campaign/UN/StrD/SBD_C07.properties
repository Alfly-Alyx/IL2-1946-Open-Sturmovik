Description October 11, 1942\nTime: 1755\nWeather: Good\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 3 x 500 pound bombs\nTarget: Oil Tankers\nTarget location: BJ/22\nDistance to target: 35 miles\nAltitude: 7,500 feet\nBomb delay: none\n\nThe weather has kept us grounded for over a week, but with great weather this morning has also come a great opportunity.  We have just decoded a flash report from the Gato-class submarine USS Sea Horse.  Here is the message:\n\nAttacking convoy... Location: north west corner of BJ/22... Convoy 6 tankers, 2 Nowaki class destroyers... Heading 035 degrees... Speed 8 knots... Time: 1732... 2 tankers on fire... Destroyers spotted us - starting their attack run... Diving...\n\nGentlemen, we are close enough to join in on the fun!  Set a course of 085 degrees after takeoff and maintain an altitude of no higher than 7,500 feet for maximum visibility. \n\nIf you spot any burning tankers you should immediately change course to 035 degrees and climb to 10,000 feet.  Do not attack the burning tankers, they will go down soon enough!  The surviving ships will be fleeing at top speed, which for tankers is only about 14 knots.  If the destroyers are still busy chasing the Sea Horse, the tankers will be easy pickings!  Make sure you keep a safe distance from the burning freighters if you decide to do a fly-by on your return.  They could explode at any moment!  That is all.\n\nWhy are you still sitting here?  GO!!!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Sink the Oil Tankers\n
