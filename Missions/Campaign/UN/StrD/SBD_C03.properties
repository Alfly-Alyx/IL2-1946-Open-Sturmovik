The USS Sea Horse spotted a Japanese convoy consisting of four troop ships, one destroyer and three patrol boats heading due west.  The convoy was spotted in sector BT/29.  Based on course and speed the convoy should now be in BS/29.  \n\nLaunch as soon as possible and fly 355 degrees to intercept the convoy.  Flight 1 attack the farthest troop ships and flight 2 attack the nearest troop ships.  Ignore the escorting ships.  \n\nWe are not providing an escort as there are no enemy carriers known to be in the area.  Call for assistance from the CAP over the carrier if you need it.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Sink troop ships\n
