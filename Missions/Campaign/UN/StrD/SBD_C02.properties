Description September 21, 1942\nTime: 0453\nWeather: Good\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 2 x SBD-3\nLoadout: 3 x 500 pound bombs\nTarget: Crippled Freighter\nTarget location: BP/9\nDistance to target: 40 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\nBomb delay: 1 second\n\nI know you guys are itching to get in some action.  It's been 8 days since we scuttled the Haney, but I think you will like what I have for you and agree that it was worth the wait.\n\nA crippled Japanese freighter has been spotted by one of our submarines on patrol.  The USS Sea Horse was maneuvering for a torpedo attack when two Japanese tin cans and a second freighter showed up.  The Sea Horse was forced to break off the attack and take up a postion outside the range of the enemy tin can's hydrophones.  \n\nThe Sea Horse decided it was too dangerous to make an attack, so they snuck away a sent a short radio message giving coordinates for a target.  We picked up the radio message on the Sitting Bull and altered course to intercept.  A flight of Wildcats was sent to the coordinates and the target was confirmed.  They are now flying a holding pattern keeping an eye on the Japanese.  Look for the Wildcats as you near the target area.\n\nYou and Lt. Powell will each take three 500 pounders and head for grid BP/9.  Sending just two of you should give you a decent chance of remaining undetected until you are on the bomb run.  \n\nA word of warning: the Sea Horse thinks the freighter is carrying something dangerous.  The transfer of cargo from the crippled freighter to the new one is going very slowly.  Obviously they don't want to drop or damage whatever they are moving.  If the freighter is carrying ammuntion you need to drop your bombs higher than normal and get the hell away from there as quickly as you can.  Even one hit will take out an ammo ship and you two pilots are the best pilots we have.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Sink the Crippled Japanese Freighter\n
