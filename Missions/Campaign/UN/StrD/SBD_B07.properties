Short SBD Campaign Mission B7\n
Description May 18, 1942\nTime: 0618\nWeather: Poor\nClouds: 2,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 3 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Japanese artillery positions on Mt. Tapotchau\nTarget location: BR/53\nDistance to target: 20 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\nBomb Delay: One second\n\nThree batteries of enemy artillery have been set up on the heights of Mt. Tapotchau.  From their position, they can shell every position we still hold on the island.  The army wants us to destroy as much of that artillery as we can.  \n\nExpect a fair amount of AAA.  Those guns will be out in the open...\n\nSCRAMBLE... SCRAMBLE... SCRAMBLE\n\nIncoming enemy aircraft!  Blueberry Three, flying CAP east of the island, reports they have just engaged a large enemy force; a squadron of torpedo bombers escorted by an unknown number of fighters.  A flight of Jap fighters has engaged Blueberry Three, but the rest of the enemy planes are headed this way!  \n\nThe Wildcats of Blueberry One, Two and Four will remain on station in their patrol areas.  We can't risk pulling them off station to have the Japs sneak a squadron of dive-bombers past them!  \n\nThe only planes available to defend the carrier is the strike group.  Wildcats launch, fly 075 degrees and engage any enemy aircraft you find, but your priority is enemy fighters. \n\nSBDs will launch, fly 075 degrees and engage the torpedo bombers.  Disrupt their attack as best you can.  If you can force a Jap plane to dump a torpedo, move on to the next plane.  Kills are not important; just make damn sure no Jap torpedoes hit the ship!!!  \n\nWe can't take the time to unload your bombs, so dump them once you are clear of the ships.\n\nPrimary Objective: Intercept the torpedo bombers\nSecondary Objective: Protect your carrier\n
