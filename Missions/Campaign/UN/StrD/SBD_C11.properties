Description October 21, 1942\nTime: 0716\nWeather: Good\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 4 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 3 x 500 pound bombs\nTarget: Submarine and secret weapon\nTarget location: BH/21\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nThe failed attack on the light cruiser exhausted the supply of the Sea Horse's torpedoes.  She decided to head back to Pearl for refit and resupply.  On her way she encountered a very strange site.  A Japanese submarine that had surfaced in the dead of the night had most of the crew on deck disasembling a large structure that had been built just behind the conning tower.  The Sea Horse decided to remain submerged and watch the enemy crew.  \n\nOnce the structure was disassembled a small plane was visible inside.  The crew then installed what could only be desribed as some sort of train track.  Apparently this plane was to launch off the sub by using this track.  The report from the Sea Horse states 'was'  because the Japanese crew ran into a problem and had to disassemble the track and place it in the water on some floats next to the sub.  Apparently, they had anticipated a problem and equipped the track with floats.  The original track appeared to be ready hours ago, but then the unknown problem was developed.  The rebuilt track took hours longer than the original plan and the sub is still on the surface at 0716.  I'm sure the plan was for them to launch this aircraft before dawn so the sub could submerge and be out of danger.  \n\nThe Sea Horse XO thinks this is some sort of secret weapon and that the target for the weapon is the Sitting Bull.  We aren't going to wait to find out!  The Sea Horse took plenty of pictures for some intelligence guy to figure out what this thing is.  The target is in sector BH/21.  Takeoff and fly 100 degrees to reach the enemy sub.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the secret weapon\n
