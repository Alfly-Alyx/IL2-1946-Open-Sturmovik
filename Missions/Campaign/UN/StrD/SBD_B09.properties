Short SBD Campaign Mission B9\n
Description May 19, 1942\nTime: 0547\nWeather: Rain\nClouds: 2,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 5 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 2 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Japanese Destroyer\nTarget location: BR/53 (far side of the island)\nDistance to target: 35 miles\nAltitude: 15,000 feet\nBomb Delay: Zero seconds\n\nI have some good news and bad news.  The good news is that we didn't lose any pilots this morning.  The bad news is that Lt. Bowser's plane is out of the fight until we get some spare parts.  Somehow, the lieutenant was able to bring his plane back for a safe landing despite the fact that he was missing his rudder and right elevator.  Anyway, we are now down to five operational SBDs.\n\nGentlemen, I hate to say it, but if we lose any more aircraft we will be forced to withdraw from this battle.  To top it off, this next mission won't be easy.  An enemy tin can has left the Japanese task force and moved in close to the island to bombard our guys.  The artillery you guys took out yesterday was damned effective against our ground troops and the Japs must have figured a tin can was a good substitute.  \n\nHere's the plan: Take off and follow a course of roughly 040 degrees until you get to Mutcho Pt/Tanapag Harbor about halfway up the west coast of the northern island.  That is the site of the seaplane base we were building before the Japs landed.  Turn due east to cross the island.  The enemy destroyer should be right off the coast.  Make your approach altitude about 15,000 feet to minimize the danger from any AAA.  \n\nExpect the destroyer to have air cover from the carrier and possibly float planes it may have launched.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the enemy ship\n
