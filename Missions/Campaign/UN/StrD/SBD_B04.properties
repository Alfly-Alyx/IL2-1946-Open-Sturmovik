Short SBD Campaign Mission B4\n
Description May 16, 1942\nTime: 1810\nWeather: Hazy\nClouds: 2,800 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 2 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Hidden Japanese base\nTarget location: BR/54 (eastern edge of forest)\nDistance to target: 35 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\nBomb Delay: Zero seconds\n\nThe Japs set a trap for us and we fell for it.  There was nothing there except a whole hell of a lot of AAA.  And that raid this afternoon cost us dearly.  We lost four aircraft and two of the crews are still missing and presumed dead.  The missing crews are Ensigns Thomas and Ryder, Seaman First Class Snyder and Seaman Second Class Leep.  Lt. Cmdr. Culley was seriously wounded, but he managed to bring his plane back to the ship.  Unfortunately, it was so shot up we had to push it over the side.\n\nWe are going after that supply base again.  We just have enough light to get you up, hit the target and get you back to the ship.  Because of the losses this afternoon we can only put up six planes in the strike group, but you will have a full flight of Wildcats escorting you and a second flight north of the island.\n\nMake your course 050 degrees.  Like this afternoon, fly up the road on the west side of the island until you get to the forest on the north end of the island.  The clearing on the east side of the forest is where the Japanese are actually hiding.  One of the recon aircraft will drop a flare as you approach.  For reference, there are three rivers immediately to the south of the target area.\n\nAgain, it is unlikely that you will see any vehicles or tents hidden in the trees so just target the entire area around the clearing.  Expect a fair amount of AAA.  \n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the hidden Japanese base\n
