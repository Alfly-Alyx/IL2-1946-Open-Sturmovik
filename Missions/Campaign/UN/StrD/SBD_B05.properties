Short SBD Campaign Mission B5\n
Description May 17, 1942\nTime: 0708\nWeather: Clear\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 3 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Japanese ground forces\nTarget location: BR/54 (road on western side of island)\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 2,000 feet\nBomb Delay: Two seconds\n\nLt. Col. Bellware has radioed in that he and his men continue to fall back on the ground.  The enemy has managed to take almost the entire northern third of the island.  However, a small force of soldiers has managed to hold off the advancing enemy on the northern-western side of the island.  Early this morning they realized they had been surrounded overnight.  Low on ammo and food, they will be making a breakout attempt this morning.  They have asked for air support to destroy any Japanese forces that try to stop the breakout. \n\nSince fighting during the breakout will be at very close range, we need to come in low to make sure we don't attack our own guys.  Flight 1 head north of our guys to destroy any japs coming from the airfield.  Flight 2 will clear the way in the south so our guys can cross back to our lines.\n\nThe XO reports all boilers are up and running so we can take a full loadout of three 500 pounders.  Make sure you set a bomb delay as we will be coming in low.  You have permission to strafe enemy vehicles if AAA is not a major threat.\n\nKeep an eye out for Japanese aircraft.  The enemy carrier should be close enough to launch fighters and strike aircraft.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy Japanese ground forces\n
