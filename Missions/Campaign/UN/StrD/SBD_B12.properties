Short SBD Campaign Mission B12\n
Description May 20, 1942\nTime: 1744\nWeather: Thunderstorm\nClouds: 4,500 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 8 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 3 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Bridges\nTarget location: BQ/53\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\nBomb Delay: One second\n\nDamn good job hitting the enemy on the beaches this morning!  Great work.\n\nI regret to report that Lt. Col Bellware's men came across the wreckage of Lt. Thomas' SBD last night.  We had hoped that they had crash-landed and were on the island somewhere.  However, the lieutenant and his gunner, Seaman Snyder, were both still in the wreckage when the aircraft was found.  The colonel reports that the men were given a proper burial. \n\nLt. Cmdr. Culley feels that the Japanese will regroup from our attack and make an attempt to get off the beach and head south.  Its too dangerous to go back to the beach, but the commander thinks he has a better idea to slow down the Jao assault.  If we take out the bridges at Garapan, just to the south of the landing beaches, the Japs will be forced to go north and then go behind Mt. Tapotchau.  With all the rain and mud that could take them a full day.  That will give us all the time we need to get the colonel and his men off the island.\n\nFlight 1, take out the southern bridge.  Flight 2, hit the northern bridge. Flight 3, hit any targets of opportunity.  \n\nFor those of you who have never attacked a bridge before, go for the ramp that runs up to the bridge.  Near misses will still destroy the bridge that way.  If you go for the span over the water a near miss will probably cause no damage at all.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the bridges\n
