Short SBD Campaign SBD C1\n
Description September 13, 1942\nTime: 1337\nWeather: Clear\nClouds: 3,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 4 x SBD-3\nLoadout: 1 x 1,600 pound bomb\nTarget: Abandoned US destroyer\nTarget location: BQ/2\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nLt. Col. Bellware and his men were successfully evacuated from Island 419.  The brass decided to have your task force escort the evacuation fleet back to Pearl Harbor and then get a minor refit before heading back to battle.  That turned out to be a good idea.  A torpedo attack from a Japanese submarine almost hit the LST carrying the colonel and his men.  A massive depth charge attack by the destroyers chased the sub away.  Two days of exhaustive air patrols turned up nothing.\n\nOnce back at Pearl, the task force was given two weeks R&R for a job well done.  Quite a few guys got medals for their action on the ground and Lt. Col. Bellware received a Silver Star.  A few medals were even handed out to some of the aircrews.  Regrettably, most of these were awarded posthumously.\n\nAfter the R&R, we all had several months of shore duty while the ships were repaired and upgraded.  There was a rumor that we might get new planes, but the few SBD-5s we saw were headed to other squadrons.  At least our SBD-3s were overhauled and a few of the worn out crates were even replaced.  Sailing orders were issued and on October 14th we left Pearl for another tour of duty. \n\nOur task force has grown.  In addition to our carrier, we now have the heavy cruiser Charleston, four destroyers and the submarine USS Sea Horse.  We are supposed to meet up with the rest of the fleet, but first we have been sent to take care of a rather unpleasant task.  The USS Haney, a destroyer escorting convoy KL127 was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine.  A valiant effort was made to save her, but the explosions and fires caused too much damage.  The crew abandoned her and she is now adrift.  The Sea Horse is having problems with her air compressors and can't fire torpedoes so she can't sink the Haney.  Your flight of four SBDs is tasked with sinking her before the Japanese can capture her.  Takeoff and fly due west for 25 miles to find her.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Sink the USS Haney\n
