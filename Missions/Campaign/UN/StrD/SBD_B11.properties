Short SBD Campaign Mission B11\n
Description May 20, 1942\nTime: 0654\nWeather: Thunderstorm\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 8 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 3 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Bridges\nTarget location: BQ/53\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\nBomb Delay: One second\n\nThe supply ship arrived late last night.  Unfortunately, the storm is slowing down our resupply efforts.  A few spare parts for the aircraft have been transferred to us, but its too risky to transfer bombs or anything large, like the crates with replacement aircraft.\n\nLt. Col. Bellware reports the situation on the ground is dire.  He doubts he can hold out much longer and has requested that the walking wounded be evacuated immediately.  The more critically wounded will have to wait until the weather breaks.\n\nThe supply ship they sent us is actually an LST and will be used to evacuate the colonel and his men.  We've all done our best to hold the island, but the enemy is too strong.  Its time to save our men for another day.  \n\nLt. Cmdr. Culley wants to buy as much time as we can for the colonel's men.  Although the thunderstorm is causing our guys problems trying to get to the beach, its far worse for the Japanese.  All of their equipment is bogged down in the soft sand and mud in their landing zones.  We are headed back to their beach to pound the crap out of them.  \n\nEveryone will take a full loadout of 500 pounders, but you will only have 50% fuel.  No enemy aircraft are expected over the target due to the severe weather.  Hopefully, the enemy won't be expecting us to be in the air either.  Flight 1 will hit the southern landing area.  Flight 2 the center landing zone and Flight 3 the northern landing zone.  \n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the enemy vehicles\n
