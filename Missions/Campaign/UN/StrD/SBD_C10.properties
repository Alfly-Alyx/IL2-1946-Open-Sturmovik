Name SBD_C10
Short SBD Campaign SBD C10\n
Description October 20, 1942\nTime: 0747\nWeather: Good\nClouds: 4,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 12 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 1 x 1,600 pound bomb\nTarget: Light Cruiser\nTarget location: BI/22\nDistance to target: 35 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nThe Sea Horse reports they fired a full spread of torpedoes at a light cruiser last night.  The cruiser was travelling at high speed and at a large angle to their course.  It was difficult to calculate the firing solution in such a short time, but they got a good solution and used a full spread of 6 torps; so it almost certain that one of the torps should have hit the target.  The captain thought it could be the stupid detonators on their Mark XIII torps.  This wouldn't the first time that they have failed to detonate when the torp struck the target.  The enemy ship didn't even slow down to investigate the torp attack and they must have seen the torps pass by the ship.\n\nThe Sea Horse estimates that the cruiser was travelling at 34 knots and was on a course of 225 degrees.  That course would bring it close enough to us to make an attack in sector BI/22.\n\nGo get her boys!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Sink the light cruiser\n
