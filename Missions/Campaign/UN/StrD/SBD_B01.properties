Description May 15, 1942\nTime: 1807\nWeather: Good\nClouds: 3,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3\nLoadout: 3 x 250 lb. bomb\nTarget: Japanese supply dumps\nTarget location: BR/54 (northern section of the northern island)\nDistance to target: 30 miles\n\nThis is it boys!  Your first chance to show us what you are made of.  Our guys are taking a beating from the Jap amphibious forces that landed on the northern coast of the island.  They overran the airfield early this morning and we were forced to abandon it.  Fortunately, the Japanese invasion fleet was forced to withdraw when our task force arrived and we have air superiority - for now.\n\nTo support their attack, the enemy has established two supply dumps on the beach near the airfield.  If we can hit these supply dumps, the Japanese attack could be stopped dead in its tracks.  Its getting late so get in the air as we only have time for one strike tonight.  \n\nTakeoff and climb to 10,000 feet.  Make your course 030 degrees.  Flight 1 will attack the supply dump near the burning hangars at the southeastern edge of the airfield.  Flight 2 will attack the supply dump to the northwest.\n\nTarget the trucks and supplies first, then strafe the landing craft if there is no AAA defending the area.\n\nPrimary Objective:\nReach the target area\n\nSecondary Objectives:\nDestroy the Japanese supply dumps\n
