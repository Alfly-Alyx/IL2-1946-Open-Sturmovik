Name StraightDownB6
Short SBD Campaign Mission B6\n
Description May 17, 1942\nTime: 1136\nWeather: Hazy\nClouds: 1,700 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 3 x SBD-3\nLoadout: none\nTarget: Locate downed SBD crew\nTarget location: BQ-BR/51 (road on western side of island)\nDistance to target: estimated 20 miles\nAltitude: 200 feet\n\nWe lost three aircraft this morning.  The pilot of the Wildcat bailed out over the island and was rescued by some of the army guys.  We hope to get him back on the ship in a day or two.  The SBD crews weren't as lucky.  Lt. Clark lost a wing to AAA diving on the target.  Neither he nor his gunner could bail out before...  \n\nEnsign Barr and Seaman Kendall ditched somewhere to the east of the large southern island.  Their last radio contact was garbled and we don't know exactly where they are, but it sounded like they could see the island as they went down.  \n\nWe are launching three SBDs to search for them.  Ensign Milano will search north of the island.  Ensign jg Park will search south of the island.  Your search area is the area east of the center of the island (BQ/51 and BR/51).  Keep your altitude below 500 feet and look for an oil slick.  SBDs leave nice big oil slicks when they sink so that should help you find the crew.  Do your best to find them, we might be looking for you tomorrow!  Good luck gentlemen.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the search area\nHidden Objective: Locate the downed crew\n
