Short SBD Campaign Mission A1\nPractice\n
Description April 17, 1942\nTime: 1351\nWeather: Clear\nClouds: 3,000 feet\n\nLoadout: 1 x 250 lb. bomb\nTarget: Broken down jeep\nTarget location: DE/66 (western most tip of the island)\n\nListen up!  After three months of training, this is your final practice mission.  Takeoff and climb to 10,000 feet.  Follow the flight path we have laid out for you.  Your target is the one on the very tip of the island.  The other aircraft will be bombing the target about a mile inland.  Don't bomb the wrong target - again!  \n\nAfter the bomb run, continue out to the USS Generic for one more practice landing.  The ship is on its way to the combat zone and you will be going with her.  Your gear has been collected and already moved out to the carrier.\n\nYou will be flying over several truck convoys and some busses just after takeoff.  Some Navy bigwigs are heading out to view your practice bomb runs.  They appear to be running late, but that's their problem.\n\nPrimary Objective: Successful carrier landing\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the jeep on the target circle\n\nPressing Control F2 will allow you to see the target if you have External Views enabled.\n
