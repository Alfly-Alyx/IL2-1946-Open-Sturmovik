Short SBD Campaign Mission B2\n
Description May 16, 1942\nTime: 0535\nWeather: Good\nClouds: 4,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 2 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Japanese armor\nTarget location: BR/54 (area southeast of forest)\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 10,000 feet\nBomb Delay: Zero seconds\n\nBoiler #2 is acting up and the XO has been forced to shut it down.  As a result, we are limited to two 500 pound bombs each as the the ship can't make enough headway for us to take a full load of three 500 pounders.  You also will be restricted to 50% fuel to save weight until the boiler is fixed.\n\nHere is the situation on the ground.  Lt. Col Bellware is in command of the army troops and he reports that you guys did a good job of pounding their supplies on the beach, but the japs had already moved a lot of stuff into the woods, including a large number of tanks.  As a result, his forces on the ground are facing a much larger force than anyone thought the japs had landed last night.\n\nFirst thing this morning the jap tanks came out of the woods and hit our guys with every thing they had.  They pushed them back over a mile.  Right now a large force of jap tanks are on the road that runs to the east of the forest on the northern edge of the island.  They are making a fast run down the road in hopes of getting behind our guys.  You gotta stop 'em!\n\nNo enemy aircraft have been sighted by the submarines or the CAP north of the island, but we are providing you with an escort just to be safe.\n\nMake your course 030 degrees.  Fly to the west side of the island and then turn due east once you are opposite the forest.  Exit the target area by flying out to sea and return to the ship.  \n\nFlight 1 will target the lead tanks.  Flight 2 will target the second group and so on.  Our guys are in the middle of the fight, so make sure you have targeted the enemy before you release your bombs!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Distroy the Japanese armor\n
