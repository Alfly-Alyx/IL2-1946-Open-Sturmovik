Description October 17, 1942\nTime: 1437\nWeather: Hazy\nClouds: 4,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 4 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 3 x 500 pound bombs\nTarget: Seaplane Tender\nTarget location: AY/24\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nEnemy seaplane activity has increased dramatically recently.  A recon flight over the base we destroyed three weeks ago indicates it has not been put back into service.  We didn't know where these seaplanes were operating from until the Sea Horse, once again, provided us with the answer.  To show our thanks, the captain has ordered the transfer of 10 gallons of ice cream from our freezer to the Sea Horse the next time we rendezvous.  No room for such luxuries on a sub and they certainly deserve a reward of some kind.\n\nThe seaplane tender and several seaplanes have been spotted in sector AY/24. \n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Sink the seaplane tender\n
