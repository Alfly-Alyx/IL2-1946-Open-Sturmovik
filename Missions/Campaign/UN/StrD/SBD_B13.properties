Short SBD Campaign Mission B13\n
Description May 17, 1942\nTime: 1011\nWeather: Clear\nClouds: 2,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 6 x F4F-4\nLoadout: none\nTarget: Protect evacuating troops\nTarget location: BQ/52\nDistance to target: 20 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\n\nLt. Col. Bellware has radioed in that the evacuation is going well and is ahead of schedule.  Your bombing of the bridges yesterday has effectively stopped any Japanese ground forces from interfering with our wthdrawl from the island.\n\nTo keep our guys safe from air attacks, two flights of SBDs and two flights of Wildcats will patrol the area.  Wildcats will engage any enemy fighters that show up.  If any ground attack aircraft show up, the Wildcats and SBDs should engage with the primary goal of disrupting the attack.  Shooting down enemy planes is secondary to getting them to dump their bomb early and running for their carrier.\n\nRemember, Kates and Vals are especially vulnerable to hits in the fuel tanks.  Come up from below and give 'em a burst in the belly and you have a good chance of taking one down.  SBD drivers, don't forget to let your rear gunners in on the fun too.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the patrol area\nSecondary Objective: Protect evacuating troops\n
