Description A Single Player Campaign for the SBD-3 in the PTO.  Most missions are carrier based.\n\nYou may choose any rank you want.  The higher the rank you choose to start with will determine which aircraft in the flight you fly.  The lower ranks will put you in the wingman positions (aircraft 2 or 4), the higher ranks will put you in the lead (aircraft 1 or 3).  However, you will always be in flight 1 of squadron 1 as all other friendly aircraft are in squadrons 2, 3 or 4.\n\nEarly 1942\nThe war in the Pacific is going poorly for the United States and the other Allied forces in the months after Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese are taking island after island and the Allies, although fighting stubbornly at every opportunity, are being pushed back everywhere the Japanese decide to plant the flag of the Rising Sun.\n\nMany of the ships sunk or damaged at Pearl Harbor will not join the war for many months, but the work of raising and repairing them has begun.  Bloodied, but not beaten, the U.S. Pacific fleet is prepared to fight back.  You and the other men of your dive-bomber squadron are part of this task force about to embark on the great battle for the Pacific.  You have been assigned to Task Force Samson, a large battlegroup consisting of four aircraft carriers, five heavy cruisers, twenty-six destroyers and numerous auxiliaries heading for Midway to confront the Emperor’s forces.  Today is the last day of your training.  After today's mission you will be off to join the war. \n\n\nLess than a month from today your destiny awaits... The Japanese conquest continues.  On an island so remote it has no name, only a number, the war is no longer a headline in the newspapers.  At 0327 on May 14, 1942 the war became personal for the men on Island 419 when the Japanese juggernaut came ashore.  In a daring move, the Japanese landed a small amphibious force in early in the morning and attacked the only base on the island.  The small airfield on the northern end of the island was quickly overrun and destroyed.  Some of the soldiers and airmen were captured or killed in their sleep, but many others got away.  The airfield, its planes and AAA guns were all lost.  A few of the valiant defenders sacrificed themselves in a fight to the death to allow their brothers in arms a chance to load a number of trucks with small weapons and supplies and make their escape.  This rag tag collection of pilots, maintenance men, cooks and clerks headed south under the command of Lt. Col. Bellware to find a place to mount a defense and hold off the attackers.  Upon hearing the account of the brave actions on Island 419, the brass has decided to send your carrier and two destroyers to go to the aid of the defenders.  Your small force has been designated Task Force Zeus.  You are to aid the defenders as best you can, evacuating them only as a last resort.  The brass wants the enemy stopped cold in their tracks!\n
