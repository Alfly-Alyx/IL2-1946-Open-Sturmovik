We have refueled and armed the dive bombers for a quick strike against the destroyers.  \n\nNinety minutes ago they were on a bearing of 310 degrees from us.  Range is probably about 35 miles if they maintained the same course and speed.  Flight 1 reports that it is doubtful they were spotted by the Japanese, so surprise will be on our side gentlemen.\n\nWe have a large strike group, so circle and form up before heading to the target.  You will have a flight of F4Fs escorting you.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the Japanese Hunter-Killer Group\n
