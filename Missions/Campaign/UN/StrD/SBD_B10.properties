Short SBD Campaign Mission B10\n
Description May 19, 1942\nTime: 1022\nWeather: Clear\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Little Big Horn\nAircraft: 6 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 2 x 500 lb. bomb\nTarget: Japanese troop ships\nTarget location: BQ/54\nDistance to target: 25 miles\nAltitude: 13,000 feet\nBomb Delay: Zero seconds\n\nThe weather was so severe earlier that we can't confirm that you sank the enemy destroyer.  It doesn't really matter as she is gone and our guys don't have to worry about being shelled any more.\n\nHowever, the supply situation is now critical.  A supply ship that rendezvoused with the main task force a week ago is now being sent to us.  We won't get much, the main force was in need of supplies just as much as we were, but anything will help.  Until it shows up we will make do with what we have - which ain't much!\n\nThe Japanese must know we are desperately short on supplies as they attempting a landing on the western shore of the northern island.  We gotta stop 'em.\n\nSome good news for once.  Lt Cmdr. Culley is fit enough to return to desk duty on a limited basis.  He will be planning all of our missions until he can return to flight status; and he planned a nice one for us this afternoon.\n\nTakeoff and fly 005 degrees to the landing area.  Go in higher than before, at least 12,000 feet this time as the landing will be covered by heavy AAA from the destroyers.  Flight 1 will attack the first troop ship  (southernmost).  Flight 2 will attack the middle ship.  Flight 3 will attack the northernmost troop ship.  Ignore the enemy destroyers, the troop ships are the target we must destroy.  You are not authorized to strafe the landing craft, as we can't afford to lose even a single aircraft.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the enemy troop ships\n
