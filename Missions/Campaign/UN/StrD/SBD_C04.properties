Name SBD_C04
Short SBD Campaign SBD C4\n
Description September 28, 1942\nTime: 0655\nWeather: Thunder\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 8 x SBD-3 and 4 x F4F-4\nLoadout: 3 x 500 pound bombs\nTarget: Seaplane Base\nTarget location: unknown\nDistance to target: 30 miles\nAltitude: 11,500 feet\nBomb delay: none\n\nWe now know that the Rufes we encountered yesterday came from a seaplane base on Island 337.  That was one of the islands that only received a single flyover from one of our recon aircraft six months ago.  Intelligence deemed the island useless for military operations.  Apparently, the Japanese decided it wasn't so useless.\n\nWe are not sure where the base is located, but our guess is that it is probably on the far side of the chain of small islands.  The big island is totally unsuitable for seaplane operations due to reefs and other obstacles just under the water.  \n\nConsider this mission an armed recon mission as you will have to find the target on your own.  Fly 290 degrees and start in sector AY/24 and follow the western coastline all the way up to AZ/26.  Good luck gentlemen... and good hunting.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the recon area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the Japanese seaplane base\n
