Description October 2, 1942\nTime: 0945\nWeather: Hazy\nClouds: 5,000 feet\n\nCarrier: USS Sitting Bull\nAircraft: 1 x SBD-3\nLoadout: none\nTarget: Search\nTarget location: unknown\nDistance to target: unknown\nAltitude: 4,500 feet\n\nThe brass wants us to conduct a search for a hunter-killer group of Japanese destroyers stalking our submarine fleet in this area.  We have lost contact with two subs and a third is returning to Pearl after being seriously pounded during a depth charge attack by the hunter-killer group.\n\nWe are launching 16 dive bombers to search the area around the fleet.  This is a search only, no bombs will be carried.  If you spot the enemy hunter-killer group do not radio a report back to the ship!  Note their position, speed and bearing and then break off contact and return to the Sitting Bull immediately.  We would prefer that the Japanese not know we are looking for them.\n\nThe aircraft flying the southern search patterns are just launching now.  Flight 1, you will fly out on a course of 310 degrees.  Head out 60 miles to the edge of BK/29, then turn south and fly 10 miles.  Return to the ship on a course of 125 degrees.  Flight 2... \n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the search area\nHidden Objective: Destroy the Hunter-Killer Group\n
