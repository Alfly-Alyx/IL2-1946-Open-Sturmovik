Description SEAFIRES FAR EAST   ======\n  \nOkinawa 1945 ; Bad weather conditions kept us two days at the ground and last night we were attacked by Japanese bombers , one of the freighters was hit we leave them savely at the shore of one of the Kerama  islands along with the wounded men, Good thing though that the US marines already captured these islands. \n \n\n\nBRIEFING:\n\n OK its another bombsorty but we' ve got no other choice, we have to repeat the bombing of the harbour of Naha and the Japanese base nearby, airsuperiority is needed without any question.! so target everything whats on the ground and focus especially on the parked  planes \n\nTime; 08;15\nWeather; Hazy\nClouds at 500m\n\nA\n
