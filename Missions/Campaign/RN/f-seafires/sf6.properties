Description SEAFIRES FAR EAST   ====Convoy-Attack mission\n  \n  Okinawa 1945 ;  The rescue mission was a  total succes and our CO was pleased and proud at the same time, for a moment we felt realy good.....but the next morning reality puts us back with two feet on the ground , the war is still going on...\n\nBRIEFING:  Listen up we are the first to attack on this convoy-mission,   Mechanics equiped your planes with rockets and you'll be flying and performing an extreme low level flight attack !  \n\nIMPORTANT: ,Because we need to have the most recent information the strike altitude will be given when you are crossing the little island of Ukubaru Shima, a sub is stationed there and your wing commander will be notifide how low you will be flying towards your target so pay attention to your altitude indicators and be carefull you don't collide with your fellow-pilots.. Once again be carefull  !\n\n.... another thing!.. we just got the message that from Tsuga Shima ,kamikaze boats are heading towards our fleet we are forced to use heavy artillery while you are starting up your engines . \n\nTime; 17;47\nWeather; Clear\nClouds at 800m\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nA\n
