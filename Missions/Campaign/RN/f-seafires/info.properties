Name *[1945 Okinawa] Seafires-TASK FORCE 57 

Description \n\ Semi Historical Campaign \n\n\      OKINAWA 1945 OPERATIONS TASK FORCE 57 \n\n\   The British Pacific Fleet- Task Force 57  supported the American US Marines to assault the Hagushi beach of Okinawa on L_DAY  [1 April 1945]  .      The story line of this action filled campaign is based on the missions and operations prior to the landing of  L-DAY.  You'll be flying a seafire under the command of the carrier HMS Indefatigable who had joined Task Force 57 in November '44  The campaign  stops after the grand and succesfull landing of the US Marines on the beaches of Okinawa          \n\n\n\                   IMPORTANT!;  choose lowest rank                            DIFFICULTY SETTINGS!; Disable 'Limited fuel'and'No instant success'\n\When you are having troubles with starting from the carrier, just hit auto-pilot.       \n\n\  Although the missions are not historically accurate, the coast landing on OKINAWA and its preparations ,prior to the landing'' have taken place. I took the liberty to make this campaign as if it realy happend the way I described the missions . [ my excuses to the purist among us ]\n\n\          JUST AN ADVICE; Because these missions are highly detailed [ harbours,moving vehicals,trees,buildings, active artillery ect...] I advice you to set your video settings lower than you are used to [I also include a single mission so you can adjust your video settings before you start the campaign], sure when you have a super pc get it on PERFECT with forest on 3 and water on 4 !.\n\ TO enjoy the full scenery you should use AUTO PILOT and EXTERNAL VIEWS before you get into battle .\n\n\And although I tried to be realistic I appoligize for incorrect markings, settings and language, my knowledge has it limits.\n\n\                   ENJOY         \n\                                       Miker8          \n\n\   Special thanks to Istvan Csizmadia VPmedia for giving me advice.\n\n\
