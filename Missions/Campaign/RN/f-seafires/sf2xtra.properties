Description SEAFIRES FAR EAST   ======\n  \n  Okinawa 1945 ; Oh..Yesterday was bad, we experienced the agony of an unsuccesfull strike and to rectify this mistake we must bomb the airbase of Naha and Kakibana to weaken enemy airsupport in the future.Their potential threat wasn't reccognised untill the attack on Yontan yesterday, the mistake have cost us a lot of good men... \n\nBRIEFING  :\n\n NOW LISTEN UP MEN :As you know our first strike on the island wasn't entirely a succes mainly because zero's from Naha  were interfering our bomb-runs . Its necessary that we strike this particular airbase to weaken further hostile airsupport and resistance in the future.When you are in range, target at the planes on the ground and prevent enemy planes from getting airborn.\n\nTime; 017;10\nWeather; Good\nClouds at 1500m\n\n\n\n\nA\n
