Description SEAFIRES FAR EAST   ======\n\nOkinawa 1945 ;Just 24 hours ago we strafed the base of Naha so now we are going to strike the base of  Yontan for the second time. Moral is good but I sense a little tension among my fellow pilots... \n\nA                [  AIRSTART!! AIRSTART!!]]\n                ====================\n\nBRIEFING;\nOK pay-back time !!.as you know,our first strike didn't do the job entirely,  mainly because of the interference of Japanese planes who were comming from Kakibana [ NAHA  harbour], so we provide you with more air cover. Hopefully it won't be needed cause the attack yesterday on the base Kakibana was succesfull, still watch out for enemy planes...!\n\nTime; 12;30\nWeather; Good\nClouds at 1000m\n\n\n\n
