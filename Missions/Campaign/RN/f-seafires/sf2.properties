Description SEAFIRES FAR EAST   ======\n\nOkinawa 1945 ;One ship was lost and a few ships were damaged by Japanese kamikaze planes  but most of the repairs could be done at sea afterwards,... still, the loss of our casualities grieves us and a few of my mates were very silent the rest of that day....                \nThe recon mission however indicated that the Japanese are refueling the airbase Yontan, We have been informed that imediate action has to be taken and I'm aware that this wil be our first important strike on the island.\n\nA                \n                ====================\n\nBRIEFING;\n\nAmerican F-4u's are already on their way, they are the first to strike the Japanese airfield Yontan. You'll be performing the second strike with bombs . Now listen,  the Americans are using the same frequency so no chit chat on the radio while the first bomb-runs are performed.Be shure to aim at the targets first before you engage combat with the Zero's! It is important to destroy their convoys aswell',in fact these will be your first objectives and the fuel-depots are secundairy targets\n\n   AIRSTART- AIRSTART-AIRSTART !!!\n\n\nTime; 5;30\nWeather; hazy\nClouds at 700m \n\n
