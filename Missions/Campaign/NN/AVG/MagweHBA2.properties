Description Burma\nApril 2nd 1942\n0608 hours\n\nToday you begin your interdiction of enemy troop and supply movements.\n\nA probable target was detected last night by the two departing AVG pilots- a seaplane base near a town, close by your flight plan yesterday\n\nYou have charted the course to this target on your maps, and marked the target area with a Recon marker. Your plan is to bomb and strafe, then clear the area immediately, so that the enemy cannot follow you home\n\nAfter your attacks, you have planned to leave the area, flying North before turning back to base in an attempt to fool ground observers as to your destination\n\nAttacking this base, so close to your own, should buy you and your wingman an extra day or two of operations, should you damage it severely enough. The two 250lb bombs the pair of you are carrying should do the trick...\n\n**Player should select '000Player' as skin**\n
