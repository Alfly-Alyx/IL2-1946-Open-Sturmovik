Short Occupy IJA fighters while your squadrom intercepts bombers\n\n
Description April 8th 1942\nAVG airbase Magwe, Burma\n1247 hours\n\nI'll make this short. An incoming raid earlier this morning snuck by the bamboo telegraph and attacked Lashio. I'm not sure how much damage was done or who dropped the ball.\n\nTake a look at your maps. The recon marker shows were we plan to intercept the raid as it returns to base. You don't have much time to get to altitude on this one; get there fast and wait for the enemy. Gain as much altitude as you can but remember that time's key in this one.\n\nThe Japanese force lost two bombers over Lashio apparently from a mid-air collision, which leaves about two dozen left. The bombers are escorted by ten to twelve Type 97 fighters- remember that these planes are much, much more maneuverable than yours, although slower.\n\nWe have diverted two flights of our planes to make an intercept on the bombers, and we are launching two flights from here to assist;  your flight will take off and intercept the fighters. You don't have to shoot them all down, just keep them off the backs of the flights that will ambush the bombers. I can't stress enough that dogfighting the Type 97 is suicidal, and that you will outnumbered three to one. Use your speed advantage. Draw them away from the bombers, do whatever it takes, have them chase you to China and back, I don't care. Knock them down if you get the chance but keep them busy. Without their escorts, the bombers should be sitting ducks.\n\nEveryone got that? Shark Red 1 will lead the flight that screens the fighters from the bombers. Shark Blue flight will be in the vicinity to assist if needed, or to attack bombers that straggle behind the main force.\n\nThe visiblity is only fair today with a slight haze. The cloud layer starts at about 3500 feet, so you'll probably see the enemy at fairly low altitudes. Questions?\n\nAlright, let's get to it\n\n**player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n
