Name Observation over Dian
Short No pictures of the fish!\n\n
Description May 9th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n1425 hours\n\nWell I'll make this one short. Reports of small observation planes are becoming more regular lately, and we have another sighting out over Dianchi. Since your flight is on alert this afternoon, you'll have to go take a look-see and find out  what's what. It's probably just more fishermen spotting one of our Chinese Air Force training flights again but be on your guard. The flight plan is on the map.\n\nThe only news that's come in on the radio is that unfortunately it's no rumor that Ben Foshee died on the 4th, the satellite airfield at Paoshan was hit hard and he lost a leg from shrapnel, while on the ground. He was on his way to the airfield when the Japs hit the town with bombers. Charlie Bond also got burned pretty bad after he had to bail out of his plane, but they tell me he'll be alright. We're not getting a lot of warning on some attacks lately; that's why we're checking out any reports of enemy reconnaissance aircraft. You'd better get going\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
