Name Kunming at dawn
Short Fly a dawn patrol over the AVG base in Kunming\n\n
Description May 2nd, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n0315 hours\n\nGood morning!\n\nI'm very pleased to see you all awake and anxious for this dawn patrol. As you know, our ground observers have a hard time locating marauding Japanese aircraft in darkness, except by sound, which makes patrols a necessity. Everyone takes their turn at it...\n\nIf you focus your attention to the map for a moment, you'll see this is just our standard local patrol over the airbase- far enough away to maybe catch a Japanese raider, and close enough to come to the airbase's aid if there are enemy planes you missed. You'll be flying at around 8500 feet. Clouds are thinly scattered around 3500 feet and the weather should stay clear and fine.\n\nCheer up- it's not so bad. A supply flight came in late last evening with fresh eggs. Duck eggs, but they are still eggs. Some of them were even un-broken. Also there's some grape juice that isn't two years old yet, butter, and some powdered milk. You'll be first in line for breakfast when you get back. You probably won't see a thing this early in the day anyway, so if you don't manage to put your planes down in a ditch, the two of you will be enjoying omelettes, toast and fruit juice after the mission. You won't even think about the sleep you lost today.\n\nMail also came in. Lots of newspaper stuff, and a few letters from banks, too. It's funny- our bankers know more about how well we're doing than almost anyone! \n\nThe papers say that some of the men in Doolittle's raid have been somehow captured by the Japanese; the Japanese claim they executed these "murderers" for their crimes. I don't believe they caught anybody. That's just a lot of big talk. I wish I'd seen their faces when those B-25s went past! Almost makes you envy those bomber boys. Almost. But anything that isn't a fighter is just another target, right? \n\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
