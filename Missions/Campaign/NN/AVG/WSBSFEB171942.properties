Short Knock out a Japanese airfield near the Burma-Thailand border\n\n
Description February 17th, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n0625 hours\n\nWell, good morning. If you look to the map, you'll see that today's first mission will take us all the way to within sight of the Thai border.\n\nDespite the efforts of Commonwealth troops in the area, several Burmese RAF airfields in various states of completion before the war have fallen into Japanese hands this week, and they have moved almost as close as the port of Moulmein.\n\nAlright, settle down, please. Yes, the Japanese have invaded far enough into Burma with ground troops to capture some abandoned airfields within our operational range. So far their foothold is small, but British Commonwealth troops are outnumbered and far from their supply lines. While we're still hopeful, we don't expect them to push the Japanese out of Burma. In fact, we expect Rangoon to come under pressure like never before and the Burmese Colonial Government may very well declare the city open, or allow it to fall without much resistance to prevent it's destruction. Our information is unclear as to what will actually happen. What seems unlikely is that even if Burma resists Japan's advances into the City, that they will be able to prevail. So the fight for Rangoon may be settled away from the battlefield. There is even talk of burning the oil reserves, millions of gallons, to keep it from the Japanese.\n\nPersonally, I expect the Governor to throw in the towel by the end of the month since the city is virtually deserted. Plans are being drawn up for our withdrawal. Magwe, further up the Irrawaddy River, seems like our first choice for a new airbase. It's already completed and is in a good location to keep us near the Burma Road. In fact, the RAF has No. 45 Squadron posted there, flying Blenheims, so supply and quarters should be good. \n\nOur plan tentatively calls for a gradual fall-back, hopping from one satellite field to the next, untill we have reached China and join the other Squadrons defending our supply routes over "The Hump" from India, over Northern Burma, and along the Burma Road itself. We'll keep you posted on that situation. Those of you who have been skipping the Current Events lectures may want to show up for a change tonight.\n\nAs for China, what the situation in Burma means is also unclear. Without Rangoon, all supply will be by air. Chennault already has the Burma Road well patrolled by First and Second Squadrons, but getting the supplies to the Road will be the tricky part. Burma is key to protecting India and the British still haven't given up, but they will need time to re-build their strength after recent setbacks. Japan wants Burma badly, to press the British back and give themselves breathing room.\n\nBut for today we'll start with pulling the teeth from this Japanese air field at Raheng.\n\nYou'll approach on the route indicated at around 5,000 feet, and attack by strafing, of course, since our Tomahawks still can't carry bombs. Some of our ex-Navy personell are working on a solution to that, and we have some old Soviet bombs, but for today, it's guns only.  \n\nWe have so many planes damaged that there's talk of us leaving what aircraft we have here for use by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons, and relocating the whole Squadron to Kunming by rail lately, so let's bring all the planes back today, alright? Those of you who have to take patched-up ships, remember what happened to Bob Sandell on the 7th. We can't afford to lose planes, but we damn sure can't afford to lose pilots like we lost Sandy. You all know how good Sandy was, don't think it can't happen to you. Bob Neale has replaced Sandell as 1st Squadron Leader, by the way.\n\nSurprise will initially be on your side. Make it count. Flak should be moderate but mostly low caliber machine gun emplacements. I'd say that heavy ack-ack couldn't have gotten into position yet, but the Japanese are nothing if not clever.\n\nTwo real concerns on this mission:\nFirst,  enemy fighters. Keep your eyes peeled- this is probably a fighter base, after all. Be on the lookout for enemy fighters, especially ones returning to the base during your attack.\n\nSecond, the weather. Plenty of ground fog, and low clouds this morning. It should clear up a bit by the time you get back, but the weather will make visibility poor during the mission.\n\nOne last thing: note where the front line is. You could get caught behind enemy lines if you are in trouble and don't pay attention to where you are. If you have trouble, get across to friendly lines. Unfinished and unused airbases are fairly common. Belly land in the lake rather than getting caught by the Japanese, or bail out over friendly territory if you have to.\n\nOK, so let's get going. We need about a 50% reduction in this airbase's capacity to have any hope of keeping Rangoon open a while longer.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n
