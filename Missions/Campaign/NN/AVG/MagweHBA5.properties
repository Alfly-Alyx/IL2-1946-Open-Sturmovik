Short Occupy a small, hidden AVG airbase behind enemy lines. Attack targets of opportunity en route\n
Description Burma\nApril 5th 1942\n0810 hours\n\nAnother Japanese depot has been located. Your targets are marshalling yards for truck convoys headed South to bring troops to railways in central Burma, so they may join in the advance towards China\n\nAs you sit and chart out your course, the drone of aircraft engines gets your attention...they are multi-engine planes, many of them\n\n...the Japanese have found your hidden base at last. Luckily your planes are already fueled. All attack plans are naturally cancelled. Your goal now is to escape the Japanese aerial attack that is certainly coming. Of course, an escape plan was made long ago:\n\nFly due East to the river, then due North, back to Magwe as fast as you can. You should have just enough fuel. You mark the area in which you should finally be safe with a recon marker, then you and your squad-mate dash for your planes, hoping to avoid being bombed on the ground...\n\n**Player should select '000Player' as skin**\n
