Short The Japanese are almost through in this area. Finish them off!\n\n\n\n
Description May 18, 1942\nSalween River gorge, Eastern Burma\n1450 hours\n\n                             ~!WARNING!~\n                             *!AIR START!*\n\nThe Japanese advances into Southern China have increased. Chinese ground forces are slowly being pushed back Northwards, and word came in that they have lost the last two major bridges that have slowed the Japanese onslaught. Despite Chinese attempts to demolish the key bridges, they still stand.\n\nEven now, as your flight navigates your P-40Es heavily laden with fuel and bombs over Burma, the Chinese 66th Army Division is fighting a desperate battle just North of the Burma/China border, opposing the "Red Dragons"- the Japanese 56th Division. If the Nationalist Chinese forces at the frontier between the two countries are defeated, virtually nothing stands in the way of the Imperial Japanese Soldier and the heart of China- which means a clear road straight to anywhere in China. Even Kunming would not be immune, despite the AVG presence.\n\nWhile Japanese forces press Northwards over the single road crossing the Salween River in an attempt to shove the Chinese aside and gain access to China's interior, reinforcements from Mandalay and Lashio bolster their strength. The Chinese cannot hope to hold out long. That single road is the Japanese Army's greatest asset, but also their greatest liability.\n\nYou make another course correction and review your mission breifing:\n\n"Gentlemen, take a good hard look at your Operations map. The point in the valley marked "Destroy Ground" is your objective. The Japanese Army has made a supply dump and temporary headquarters here, just South of the two main bridges across the Salween river. They feel it's a safe spot. The gorge is sheltered there, with cliff walls over 1,000 feet high on both sides of the road. They feel protected from aircraft here, with a mountain to the South, their Army to the North, and sheer cliffs shielding the East and West.\n\nOne bomb, gentlemen. One bomb in this little protected cleft would bring the whole works down. Tons of rock would cover the road, and maybe even destroy the bridge, which somehow stood up to Chinese attempts at destruction. We know it's damaged. One bomb would bring it down. Needless to say, that one bomb would also wipe out the Command Staff for the Japanese 56th Division.\n\nWhat would this do? This one bomb would sever the head of the Dragon. Without it's Commander and Staff, the Japanese 56th will likely falter and fall back. If we can also take out the bridge, the majority of the 56th's striking force will be isolated, cut off, and mopped up by the Chinese 66th in short order.\n\nThis defeat would cripple Japanese advances here. The Chinese will be able to re-group, and march South, sealing off this highway to China. If we do not hand them this defeat from the air, the Chinese cannot do it from the ground today. If that happens, if the Chinese are defeated here, then expect Japanese trucks outside your barracks doors by tomorrow night. We are only 230 miles away from your target, right here in this operations room.\n\nTherefore: your Primary target is the troop concentration by the Southernmost bridge at the target area. You should see tents, supplies, and vehicles there. Look carefully at the map! Identify this area and remember it well. We won't have a second chance at this. Only a miracle will stop the Japanese if the Chinese lose this battle. If you hit this spot hard enough, that cliff wall will do the rest.\n\nThis mission will be flown by our best dive-bombing pilots from all three squadrons. These men won't need any help finding their target- just let them do their thing.\n\nThird Squadron will provide escort- Olson, you will personally lead the escort, I want you to hand pick the other three pilots. The striking flight and it's escort will approach the gorge from the West as shown, at high altitude. Flight leaders- maintain control over your flights! Regroup after the attack.\n\nYou'll be taking four E models for the bombing run, and the escort will be made up of four of the older P-40s. Weather here is bad; it should clear after you refuel at Yunnayi and then make your way to the Gorge.\n\nI'm depending on this mission to succeed. After the bombing run, get out of there. You should be safe once you get to the point marked "Recon" at the North of the map, where the mission will end.\n\nAny questions? Any at all? OK, study that map and make this one count. This mission will be the most critical we ever run and China's fate as well as all our own depends on you today. Godspeed"\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\nnote- if player leads flight, do not assign ground targets to squadmates, it is recommended to let them bomb on their own. To avoid having squadmates crash into a mountain, it is advisable to leave the area immediately after the bombing attack, because the AI will circle and strafe\n\n\n
