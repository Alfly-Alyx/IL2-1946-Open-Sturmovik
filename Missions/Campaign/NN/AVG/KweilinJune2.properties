Description June 2nd 1942\nKweilin, Kwangsi Province, China\n0832 hours\n\nWell, welcome to Kweilin. We have a nice little arrangement here as you can see. This field is supposed to be the Old Man's main Eastern China airbase, and it's close enough to the truth for the job. Good ground facilities, plenty of food, a town not more than an hour's bicycle trip to the South, with markets, stores, and even a hospital. If it weren't for the Japanese trying to bomb the place, I wouldn't mind retiring here!\n\nYou'll get to know the area well enough. There's plenty of local landmarks and rivers to navigate with. They tell me that the rocks and cliffs around here are unique in all the world. There's nothing like it anywhere else. There's enough of them, that's for sure. Be careful when flying low is my advice. Oh, this airfield is at about 150 feet elevation by the way. \n\nThat brings me to operations here. We run an alert system a little different from other bases you might have been in...we don't have great radio equipment here, and our alerts are usually pretty urgent. See that pole next to the control hut? Well when there's an alert, take a look out to that pole. See it right there, next to the alert gong? The locals set that up for us, they call it the "Ching Pao". The more red balls you see on that Ching Pao pole, the closer the enemy is. If you see three balls, the Japs are either overhead or will be in five minutes or so. That gong's a piece of armor plate we bang on, since we don't have an air raid siren out here. Kind of quaint, I know, but it works well enough.\n\nEnough local flavor, there goes the alert now! Only one ball, let's see what's going on... We've got some reports of an unscheduled flight or two inbound, headed straight for us. Around here, any unscheduled flight is about 99% sure to be Japs. Take a look at the map for a minute.\n\nThe spot marked 'recon' to the East is where we estimate you can make contact with the unidentified planes. They're probably Japanese, since we here are the only friendlies around and no supply flights are due to come in from the East for five days.\n\nEnemy planes around here are usually I-97s, and Japanese Army type 99 Assault planes- those are dive bombers. We also get some Army Type 2 twin engined fighters sometimes. They are pretty fast, but you can out-manuever them easily.\n\nWell good luck, your flight's already headed to the flight line. Bag a couple for me this morning.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n
