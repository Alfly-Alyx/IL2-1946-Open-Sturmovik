Description March 9th 1942\nIrrawaddy River valley, East of Magwe, Burma\n1051 hours\n\n\n                          ~*!WARNING!*~\n                               ~Air Start~\n\nYou have succesfully evacuated the Rangoon area, and are now arriving in the area of Magwe, your new airbase, located along the Irrawaddy River. To Magwe's North lies Lashio, the Southern end of the Burma Road. \n\nYou are flying in a two-plane element, formed at the temporary airbase at which you refueled, to the North of Rangoon.\n\nSince leaving Mingaladon, the weather has turned increasingly bad. Thunderstorms have come and gone, and visibility has dropped. You are currently at 2800 feet, and have just come down through a slight overcast, which is clearing.\n\nOn your kneepad map, you have your route to Magwe outlined. You are to fly your current course until your first waypoint, Heho, a village at the bend in the Irrawaddy River. Then follow that river Northeast past two towns to a fork in that waterway, where the River splits. The Irrawaddy continues Northeast, and Magwe is the town sprawled on both sides of it's fork.  At Magwe, you must turn due East to find your new airbase*.\n\nYour notes tell you that the favored approach to the airstrip is from the East, and that the runway is at approximately 250 feet elevation. Mountains and hills in this area are noted as being much less in elevation as compared to those in Southern Burma.\n\nYour goal on this mission is to navigate to your new home and land safely. From this base you will be able to defend the Southern terminus of China's overland lifeline, and conduct raids against Japanese airbases in Northern Thailand.\n\nYour long term goals here remain the same as always: destroy Japanese assets while keeping your own survival and the survival of your Squadmates the top priority- dead pilots cannot defend China\n\n*Please note that as always, autopilot is available for navigation in this mission\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n\n
