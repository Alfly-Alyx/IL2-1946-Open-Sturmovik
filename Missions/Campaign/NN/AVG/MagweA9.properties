Short Attack an IJA airbase in Thailand\n\n
Description April 9th, 1942\nNear Kai Tak airfield, Thailand\n0743 hours\n\n                           ~!WARNING!~\n                            *AIR START*\n\nAfter much effort, RAF reconnaisance aircraft have located one of the bases in Thailand that mixed Japanese bombing and fighter units call home. Your objective for today: attack that airbase.\n\nYou have taken off from Magwe in the pre-dawn hours to conduct your raid. Gradually, as dawn crawls by, you can consult your kneepad map and your notes on the mission.\n\nThe base you're attacking today is home to a unit of Japanese twin engined bombers. Also stationed here is a small group of fighter aircraft, the Japanese seem to make good use of mixed-type  units. Defensive artillery is present, but is most likely small caliber. The strip itself is crushed gravel and grass, much like the ones you have been flying from, and it runs roughly from East to West.\n\nJapanese patrols in the area are infrequent, since this is essentially a rear area. Past recon flights have not seemed to evoke any response from the ground until visual contact is made, so the element of surprise should be yours.\n\nYou are flying in a three plane group today, and you have one 250lb bomb each. Your notes stress the need for vigilance against enemy fighters. You also make mental note of your fuel status: 60% fuel remaining. You can't stick around here forever and expect to get back to Magwe.\n\nYou should reach the enemy airbase by about 0800 hours, roughly from the Northwest, and from around 7,000 feet. Pick your targets, dive in, bomb, strafe, and recede from AAA range. Multiple passes are dangerous; make your first few count.\n\nWeather here is partly cloudy at around 5,000 feet. Visibility is only fair but might clear by the time you reach your target.\n\nYou will end your mission by leaving the target area, and reaching the recon marker on your map\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n
