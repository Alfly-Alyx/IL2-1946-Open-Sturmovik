Description April 18th 1942\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n1300 hours\n\nLoiwing is again the target of Japanese attention.\n\n This time it's more photo-recon aircraft, apparently escorted by I-97s. We can't allow the Japs to get good intelligence on our aircraft, our airfields, or our resupply situation, especially since we've got some new planes from the States in the area that Chennault's eager to keep safe from the Japs.\n\nShark Red flight will put two aircraft over Loiwing and destroy all enemy recon aircraft at once. Your route is on the map. That is all.\n\n\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n
