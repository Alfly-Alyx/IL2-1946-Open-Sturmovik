Short Magwe\n\n
Description March 24th 1942\nAVG airbase Magwe, Burma\n1051 hours\n\nWell, this is a big day. Thanks for volunteering\n\nIn case you've forgotten, you promised the Old Man a little dive bombing display once the ground crews figured out a way to hang bombs on our planes. Well we got the word last night- we're ready to go. Chennault flew in, and he's waiting out in the field to see how we do. Carrying a bomb could be handy once in while.\n\nI've made up a flight plan for you. Dead easy. Just fly the pattern I've marked out, dive on the target marker, and drop the egg on the Jap plane we rigged up out of canvas and wood. No trouble\n\nJust don't dive too steeply- they tell me the bomb might actually go through your propeller if you do that. And watch your airspeed, around 440 mph indicated you might lose an aileron or two. Maybe the tail. What are you looking at me like that for? Get going!\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n
