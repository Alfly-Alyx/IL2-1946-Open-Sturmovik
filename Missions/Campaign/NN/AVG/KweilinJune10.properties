Description June 10th 1942\nKweilin, Kwangsi Province, China\n1839 hours\n\nThere goes the alert! Two balls...reports from the North...a single small aircraft, low altitude. Maybe a recon plane. Following the river, heading South.\n\nOK, we're sending one plane out, who's on alert duty? Shark Red leader? Fine.\n\nHere's a mission map. Fly North and keep your eyes peeled. It might be tough to spot that small an aircraft at low altitude at this time of day. Fly to the recon point, and turn South. You should pick up the contact somewhere on your return trip if we've figured this right. Well, I'll walk you out to the flight line.\n\nHere we are. We just had news from HQ come in  before the alert, by the way. You're going back to Kunming tomorrow morning, Chennault's orders.\n\n**player should select '000Player' as skin**\n\n\n
