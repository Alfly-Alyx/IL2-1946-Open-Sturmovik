Description June 29th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n0835 hours\n\nGood morning. Please have a seat and look to the Operations Map.\n\nThis morning, we want to provide some close support to Chinese troops battling a Japanese advance over the border. As you can see, they are again hoping to repair a bridge to gain access to the relatively undefended Chinese interior.\n\nChinese troops are holding, but need assistance. Shark Red flight will take three P-40Es out to the location of the fight, just to the South of the recon marker on the map, and drop bombs on the Japanese troops there. Anti-aircraft fire is to be expected.\n\nWeather this morning is clear with high scattered clouds. Shark Red One will have two wingmen on this mission. The bombs the P-40s will carry today are relatively small compared to the larger Russian demolition bombs you've dropped before, make them count.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
