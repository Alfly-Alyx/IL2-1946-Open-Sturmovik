Name Leaving Burma?
Short Plans changed\n\n
Description April 26th\nLoiwing, AVG airbase Burma\n1325 hours\n\nWell, you don't need me to tell you what's going on. Our plans have been completely shattered. A large raid was able to slip by us earlier today, while all our serviceable planes were on patrol, and hit Loiwing hard this morning.\n\nEvery one of our new P-40Es was destroyed outright or damaged beyond immediate repair. Maybe we can truck some of them out. In addition, repair services here have been severely damaged, and the repair facilities at CAMCO have been suspended. \n\nTo make matters worse, a follow up raid is coming in. We have just three planes right now that can put up a defense. All others need repairs or replenishment of ammunition, fuel and oxygen that were destroyed during this morning's attacks.\n\nI know this is a big disappointment. Those new planes would have made some real trouble for the Japanese. We'll just have to make do with what we've got. These old Hawks have done the job so far, and they'll see us through whatever else the enemy can throw at us.\n\nThe attack is coming from the West, at around 10,000 feet. If you refer to your map, you can see the intercept point we've plotted for you, indicated by the recon marker. They are coming back to finish us off, your job is to hold them back. Remember, just damaging one of these planes enough to make the pilot jettison his bombs is as good as shooting him down in flames. Target leaders, as usual.\n\nAll non-serviceable aircraft have been pushed off the tarmac and hidden as best as can be hoped in such a short time.\n\nAfter your interception, return here at once, so we can patch up the planes we still have and make our flight to Kunming. I'll consider this mission successful if you just make it back in one piece- we need all the planes we can get now.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n
