Short We've been caught with our pants down! Repel the air raid!\n\n\n
Description June 27th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n0848 hours\n\nGood Morning. I'm sure by now you've all seen the new faces around the base. The 11th Bombing Squadron and it's B-25s, as well as the P-40 pilots of the 51st Fighter Squadron and their aircraft have finally arrived. The US Army's arrival here is the first sign that we will be disbanding soon- come July 4th, this airbase and all planes attached to it become part of the 10th Air Force is what I'm told. I guess we all know now why the Army was so anxious to have some of it's pilots serve with us these last few weeks.\n\nCommunication with the US military confirms that US Army commissions are available if any of you wish to stay here and join the USAAF. Five already have. After General Bissel's speech the other day, I'm surprised that even five elected to stay. Also, a few have expressed interest in work as transport pilots, and those positions have been officially confirmed as well. Off the record, I don't beleive a word of Bissel's bull about forcing us to join the Army. We each have a signed contract about our military status and where we'll serve. Personally I would like a rest back home in Los Angeles before shipping out again.\n\nToday, we will start by performing a routine patrol along the Chinese/Burma border. Reports of enemy activity there are growing. We'll use Combat Patrol Route One today. All available squadron aircraft will make this patrol, today it's 3rd Squadron's turn. Shark Red One will be the leader's callsign, and he will lead sixteen planes. Make your patrol at 8000 feet and return here for your next mission orders. The weather has turned sunny, with high clouds. \n\nQuestions? All right 3rd Squadron, report to the flightline at 0915. For those of you with no orders until this afternoon, mail has come in. You'll be interested to read in the papers that the German Army is being pushed back from the gates of Moscow by the Soviets. Bank statements have come in as well. See the Financial Officer to... excuse me a moment.\n\nAll orders are cancelled. Third Squadron, get your combat patrol flight up immediately! Japanese divebombers and fighters are approaching from the Northeast. Get your planes up and drive these attackers off. They will be here in under five minutes. Use as many aircraft as are ready. Get going!\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n\n\n\n
