Name Kwangsi Province Template by Chris Blair
Short This template simulates the area around Kweilin, in Kwangsi Province China, around 1942\n
Description June 8th 1942\nKweilin, Kwangsi Province, China\n0530 hours\n\nGood morning! We've got a two ball alert going on right now, another bombing raid. There are twelve Japanese twin engined bombers headed our way, approaching from somewhere to our South. Take a look here on the map.\n\nThey look like they are flying at about 9000 feet. No escort has been reported, but you know how that can go. OK, we've mapped out a rough patrol box to the South, as you can see. Get there quick, and fly that patrol box pattern. You won't have to make too many circles up in the sky I think. \n\nYou should spot the enemy sometime just before 0600 is my guess. The skies are pretty clear this morning, no problems with visiblity. Looks like Chennault's instincts were right again. OK, now move it!\n\n**Player should select '000Player' as skin**\n\n\n
