Name Moulmein
Short Photo recon over Moulmein\n
Description March 5th 1942\nRangoon, Burma\n1035 hours\n\nGood morning, men. Thanks for the escort down here the other day. That was some storm, wasn't it? Now that the weather has cleared I need a special mission run, and I need you to accomplish it.\n\nThe Japanese seem to be setting up the captured base at Moulmein as their primary staging area for the seige of Rangoon. Ever since it fell, we have been seeing more and more varied enemy aircraft.\n\nWe need a reconaissance of Moulmein and it's airfield, to see what the Japanese are preparing. The field istelf is typical of the RAF fields in the area- grass and dirt. It is situated just to the north of the town and port of Moulmein. As a secondary Burmese port, it can host a number of ships, which means that the Japanese can easily fuel their rapid advance up the coast to Burma. \n\nThree ships will fly this recon mission, all from 3rd Squadron- a photo plane, which you will pilot, and two escorting P-40s. Your photo plane is Erik Shilling's modified fighter. On this mission however, you will carry no ammo for your guns- the weight of all the camera equipment and film plus your ammo is just too much for safety. We need you to come back with that film, not stall out and pile into a mountain. You will have to rely on your speed and your escorts for protection.\n\nAreas of Japanese advance can be expected to contain anti-aircraft weapons. Expect it over Moulmein especially and watch for Japanese gunboats. You need to be at around 8500 feet for the camera to focus enough to give us good photos, which is a little low for comfort, I know. All you need to do is turn on the camera switches, and bank your plane 90 degree to the left, the camera will do the rest. Have a look at your flight map.\n\nWe have several areas of interest that we want you to recon- the first is a village that the British and Japanese are fighting over, just over the front line. The second, and most important, is the airfield at Moulmein. Lastly, the port of Moulmein needs to be photographed.\n\nThe weather is good with only a few scattered clouds. Your targets should have blue skies overhead. You need to do is overfly your targets and turn the camera switches on for ten seconds in a lefthand bank. That's all there is to it. If you run into trouble, run for home and let your escorts or our standing patrol handle it. Remember- your guns are empty, no fighting. Good luck.\n\n[Player note: of course, we have no photo equipment available in the sim. Simply flying over the recon markers closely is good enough for success]\n\n**Player should choose "PhotoPlane" as skin**\n
