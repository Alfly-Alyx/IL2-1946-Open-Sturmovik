Description May 12th, 1942\napproximately 50 miles West of Hanoi, IndoChina\n0658 hours\n\n                      ~!WARNING!~\n                      *!AIR START!*\n\n\nPeriods of driving rain and distant claps of thunder have welcomed you to IndoChina. Today you are escorting P-40Es from the 1st Squadron on an attack. Their target: The fighter and bomber base just outside of Hanoi.\n\nEver since the Japanese relieved the Colonial caretakers of IndoChina of it's management burden, Hanoi has been a major airbase for operations against China. The AVG mounts irregular raids against Hanoi, and other airbases in the country, in an effort to curtail bombing attacks.\n\nA small break in the weather around Kunming  has allowed an opportunity for a larger than usual attack: twenty aircraft will make the trip to Hanoi today and destroy as many grounded aircraft as possible. The poor weather around Hanoi has been an unexpected benefit- many aircraft will be parked and undergoing maintenance prior to your arrival- not many should be in the air- they will be on the ground with crews removing canvas jackets from engines and canopies. Their relief at a pause in the rain will be short-lived as your attack should come down around their ears just as the sun starts to break through.\n\nYour orders are to suppress any Japanese fighters that attempt to take off from the airbase. The flight of four Hawks you are in should handle that job with ease. In addition to the P-40Es carrying 1,000 pound bombs, 1st Squadron has a flight of escorts to accompany you. Their job is to protect the P-40Es from threats already airborne. Three flights of four aircraft each will undertake the actual bombing raid.\n\nYou are currently headed Southeast, at approximately 5,500 feet. In a few minutes, you should be able to spot a river. You are to follow this river to a nearby city- Hanoi, and the attack will take place at the airbase just to that city's North.\n\nAlthough the weather has begun to clear, clouds are still very low and may pose a visibility problem during the attack. You and your flight will need to be on hand when the bombs start falling, so beware of any distractions that may keep you from protecting the fighter-bombers.\n\nThe Chinese border lies not far to the North- you'll need to make it back across to friendly territory, on the route provided, to make the mission a success.\n\n**Player should select '000PlayerDisney' as skin**\n\n\n\n
