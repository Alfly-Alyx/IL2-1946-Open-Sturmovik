Short One of our supply flights is in trouble. Defend it! You're on your own this time\n\n\n
Description January 14th, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG Airbase, Burma\n0925 hours\n\nWe have an overdue CAMCO supply flight coming in. These C-47s are carrying prop reduction gears, tail wheel tires, thrust bearing sumps, and other parts for our planes and we need the spares badly. We are down to nine operational planes out of twenty-five right now, and five of those are patroling to the North, where they hope to ambush an expected Japanese raid on Rangoon. But there is another problem.\n\nThe overdue flight has just radioed that they are being followed by a Japanese float plane. They aren't under attack just yet we think, but the plane is shadowing them. It's becoming clear that this float plane is simply directing a Japanese fighter intercept of the cargo planes and will not initiate an attack of it's own, even though the CAMCO C-47s are unarmed.\n\nYou need to take one of our four remaining stand-by aircraft on the field and escort these C-47s to Toungoo, where they will make an emergency landing. They will re-fuel and finish their journey here after the enemy threat is removed.\n\nWe cannot spare more than one aircraft to fly this mission, we are that low on serviceable aircraft right now. Since Charlie Mott was lost on the 8th, we've been in a fix. Nobody knows what happened to him still, and worse, that crash you heard early this morning was another landing accident. At about 2 am, Pete Wright landed his damaged plane without being able to see, Prestone was spraying the cockpit. Pure accident, but he slid off the runway and piled into a car that Ken Merritt was sleeping in. Ed Rector and Tex Hill had been in the car too, only minutes earlier. They are all right, but Merritt was killed. Pete's taking it pretty bad. So we need those other planes here, in case the inbound Japanese raid to the North targets this airfield. Be extremely careful on this one, remember, you're all alone.\n\nYour intercept path will take you to the location we estimate the transports will be near in about half an hour. The C-47s are flying at around 5,000 feet and the pilots are getting increasingly nervous. It would make our situation here pretty bad if they got spooked and dumped their cargo to gain some speed, or worse yet- got shot down. We are already taking parts off of damaged aircraft just to keep our flyable ones in the air, and we can't keep this up for long.  Get there quickly!\n\nBack home, the newspapers say that the Fleet at Pearl is rising again- literally. They are raising and repairing all but two of the battlewagons that hit the bottom on December 7th. Once those Navy boys get back on track, the US can turn it's luck around in this war. The papers also report that Hong Kong really did fall to the Japanese on Christmas day, it's no rumor.\n\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n
