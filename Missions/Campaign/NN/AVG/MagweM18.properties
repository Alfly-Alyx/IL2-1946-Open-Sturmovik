Description March 18th, 1942\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n1140 hours\n\nWell, as you can see on the map, the Japanese advance North has continued...but it has also been stalled. Radio reports from British Forces indicate that the rugged Burmese terrain is finally slowing down the Japanese a bit. They tell us that Chinese troops have begun to move south into Burma to help defend this country against total Japanese occupation as well. Our friends at No. 45 Squadron also gave the enemy a rude surprise last night, by destroying several key bridges and a town they had captured and were beginning to garrison. Luckily, the Japanese moved most of the residents out prior to taking up housekeeping. Local guerrillas say the villagers were simply moved to a neighboring township, but that Japanese forces in the occupied hamlet got clobbered.\n\nSince the Imperial Japanese Army has penetrated almost a third of the way to China, the RAF wants to find out just what they are up to next. The stalled offensive finally gives them a good opportunity for some effective recon work in this area.\n\nNo. 45 squadron has several recce aircraft converted from standard Blenheim bombers. They have made a few sorties over the IJA lines, but they always seem to come under attack near Pindaya- close to the 'recon' icon you see marked on the map. Last sortie, they lost two Blenheims.\n\nToday they will try to do some photo op work again to gauge damage inflicted on Japanese targets bombed last night, but they have asked for assistance. \n\nShark Red One will be leader of a two plane element that will escort RAF recon Blenheims through this danger zone . The 'recon' marker is where no less than four seperate RAF aircraft- and one of our own- have been lost.  This is no coincidence so expect an attack from determined and skilled Japanese pilots.\n\nYour flight path will be at approximately 8,000 feet, while the Blenheims will conduct their photo op work at about 7,000. The route you will escort them on will cover several areas of interest, from potential routes for a British counterattack to lines of retreat and advance by Japanese forces. Weather is currently slightly hazy, with the ground fog typical of the area, but that should burn off soon. Clouds are scattered at over 5,000 feet, and visibilty should be very good during your mission.\n\nNews from China says that General Joseph Stillwell has been appointed Allied Commander in Chief of this theatre, at Generalissimo Chiang's request. Let's see what 'Vinegar Joe' can do here in this neck of the woods. Heck, we might even meet him when we get to China, you never know.\n\nOK, that's enough Current Events. Our news is so old, Stillwell's probably been in Asia for a month, anyway. Hop a jeep to the flight line. You can expect a fly-by of photo Blenheims in less than 10 minutes, so get your planes warmed up and in the air pronto. Good luck.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n
