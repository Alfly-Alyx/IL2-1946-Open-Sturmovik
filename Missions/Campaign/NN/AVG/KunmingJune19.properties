Short Make sure the US press gets away! Escort of C-47s\n\n
Description June 19th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n0730 hours\n\n\nWell, I hope we all enjoyed our moment in the Sun. It's not every day that newspaper reporters pay a visit, and the last few days probably made you all feel like budding Clark Gables. I'm sure you all will claim you got suntans from the flash bulbs when you get home. Now that you've lived the Hollywood dream, it should be a nice change of pace to get on with our job around here. It's too bad Lewis Bishop had to bail out over IndoChina just the other day, he would have loved this stuff. Sure hope he's OK after landing so close to the Japs...which reminds me about Tom Jones. Listen up, all of you.\n\nChennault has made it a point to tell Hill, Neale, and I that if a reporter asks you about training accidents, to refer them to either himself, your Squadron Leader, or somebody like John Williams in HQ section. It's bad enough Tom  crashed during bombing practice, so his family doesn't need to hear about his death from some off-hand remark quoted in the Times, is that clear?\n\nAnyway, let's look at the map. As you know, all those newspaper men and their crews are leaving today. They had wanted to stay until the 22nd when the USAAF shows up to begin preparations for taking over this airbase, but the weather boys have nixed the idea. \n\nThey need to leave today, and are scheduled to depart at 0810. As you can see, 3rd Squadron will provide an escort during take-off. Two aircraft from that Squadron will accompany two C-47s carrying the VIPs to the North, by the recon marker you see on the chart. Leader will be Shark Red One. At this point, that flight of escorting fighters will hand off escort duties to a flight from 1st Squadron, Shark White, which is conducting a patrol near the Burma/India border that happens to be on the C-47s flight path.\n\nProtection of these civilians is of course a top priority. Japanese fighters will not know, much less care, about the people on board those planes, and with the increasing numbers of day intruder flights the Japanese Army has been sending over this part of China, the escorting planes will have to be on the alert at all times.\n\nThe pleasant news is that ceiling and visiblity is unlimited today, with scattered clouds at 5000 feet. \n\nIt's too bad that we couldn't get more out of the reporters about what happened at Midway. Sure, we know the Japanese took a beating at the hands of the US Navy, but what really happened out there? They probably only know what they read in the papers, too. But one thing's for sure. The tide's finally turned for the US.\n\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n\n\n
