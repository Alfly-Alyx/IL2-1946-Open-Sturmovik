Short Intercept the bombers en route to Lashio\n\n\n
Description March 29th 1942\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n1152 hours\n\nAn inbound Japanese attack on Lashio has turned out to be larger than we thought. Ground observers have informed us via 'bamboo telegraph' that what was thought to be a small raid on Lashio has turned out to be double the strength we had estimated. Rail heads in the city are most likely the target. We have a patrol already out to make the intercept, but with twice the targets plus a fighter screen to deal with they will need help.\n\nI know we have very few combat ready aircraft right now, but with a supply flight coming in with spares and tools, we are going to chance sending almost all our fighters against this wave of attackers. I don't have to tell you how important every fighter we have is to us; not to mention your own lives. We have only nineteen pilots and eleven serviceable aircraft at the moment. Coming home after the mission is as important as making another kill. Use your heads out there. And go easy on your landings from now on. Three of our planes that are down for service have landing gear and tire problems. One of them has all three tires blown and I'm amazed it didn't ground loop. I know that crushed gravel and grass isn't what these planes were designed to land on, but that's all we've got, so baby the gear from now on. Clear?\n\nOK, turn your attention to the map, please.\n\nThe interception point is shown on your map by the recon marker. Fly to this point, and rendezvous with White 5's flight which is on-station awaiting the raid right now. You should have enough time to join them in their attack. Between your two flights, there will be eight aircraft to attack as many as two dozen bombers with an escort, although of course White 5 will retain control of his Section during the attack.\n\nThe Japanese are flying at approximately 6,500 feet. Try to reach 10,000 feet before you spot them to counter their fighter escort.\n\nWeather is fine and clear, with some scattered clouds over 10,000 feet to the South, but clouds in your area will be at over 30,000- perfect visibility.\n\nOK, I'll drive you out, let's go.\n\nWord from the States is that MacArthur has been ordered by Roosevelt himself to leave the Philippines despite his intention of staying, win or lose. It looks bad for the US forces there, particularly for the men trapped on the Bataan peninsula and on Corregidor. No, I'm not really sure where those places are either, there will probably be a map in a newspaper when the mail arrives. Thank God we're not there, though. Alright, here we are, good luck.\n\n**Player should choose "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n
