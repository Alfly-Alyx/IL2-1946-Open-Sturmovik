Description February 24th, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n0800 hours\n\nThe Allied situation here continues to suffer. The Japanese are steadily advancing eastward towards Rangoon, and I have been given word that the British and Colonial forces in Burma have been defeated at a major battle near the Sittang River bridge. Materiel and equipment is being evacuated from Rangoon, and Allied shipping is finding it near impossible to get to port there. Soon, no ships at all will come for fear of being trapped in the harbor, or worse, bombed if the Japanese ultimatum for surrender isn't acknowledged. Supplies have been getting unloaded and just left on the docks, because the local workers are leaving the city. Rangoon will fall soon if no outside help arrives. \n\nThe Chinese government has offered to send considerable troops as reinforcements, but the word is that British forces are more worried about getting the Chinese out of Burma after the war than they are about the Japanese right now.\n\n We are doing what we can, but without spares and effective communication with the British, we are more or less on our own. 1st Squadron will raid the Jap base at Moulmein today, while 2nd Squadron will provide a combat patrol over this field in case of attack.\n\nIn the 3rd Squadron, our focus has turned, as you may have noticed, from constant vigilance over Rangoon, to keeping pressure off of the roadways and rail approaches to our end of the Burma Road, so the goods and arms in Rangoon's warehouses can actually make the trip to China.\n\nToday we add another dimension to that task- assisting in a ground battle of sorts.\n\nPego, a town near the edge of Japanese expansion to our Southeast, is a major repository for war materiel, much like the warehouse district of Rangoon. Here, raw materials such as oil are taken from tanker trucks and put on railway tankers at the railhead nearby, for the trip to China. British garrison forces repulsed a small scouting force earlier today; doubtlessly a follow-up assault will take place, as the oil reserves there are a rich prize for the Japanese, who need oil desperately.\n\nThe Imperial Japanese ground forces will most likely be supported by air.\n\nFly to Pego, on the route shown on your map. Your altitude will be approximately 5,000 feet on your approach. Defend British positions and armor in the town from aerial attack. Beware of local anti-aircraft defenses; they will likely be small caliber but they can still shoot you down. Also remember that escorting fighters may be present if you spot dive-bombers, and that the rear gunner on a dive-bomber has as good a shot at you as you do at him.\n\nIf British forces can hold out for just a day or so, the remaining oil can be trucked out, even if the railhead falls the the Japanese.\n\nI hope you all have your bags packed, because we could be pulling out of here and relocating North any time now.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n
