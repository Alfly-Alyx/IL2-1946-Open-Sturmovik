Name Working on the Railroad
Short Defend rail traffic from Japanese raiders\n\n
Description February 6th, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n1810 hours\n\nBad news, boys, it looks like the Brits are going to be bottled up and trapped in Singapore, and the whole of Malaya has fallen to the Japanese. That means more of their troops can be sent here. On the other hand, British Colonial forces in Burma report they are near to forcing a showdown with the Japanese near the Sittang River. Hopefully they will be the victors. Keep your fingers crossed.\n\nAs you know, the Northbound rail system is the lifeline to Lashio, and Lashio is the Southern terminus of the Burma Road, which leads to Kunming- the only overland supply route to China.\n\nRecently at dawn and dusk, our ground observers have reported small, probably one or two seat single engine, slow moving Japanese planes at low altitude near railheads and bridges, apparently looking for trains to attack. The two areas most commonly visited by these aircraft are shown by the recon markers on the map.\n\nToday we start patrolling the railways as best we can, with special vigilance in these two areas.\n\nYour two plane flight will follow the route shown. Unfortunately, you'll have to stay pretty low in order to find your way and to spot trains under attack, and the areas you need to be most alert in have become increasingly cloudy.\n\nRail traffic is as important as the port at Rangoon to the war effort, and it's one of the big reasons we are here in Burma instead of up in Kunming with everyone else. With the situation at Rangoon, it's important to make sure all supplies already here get to their destinations, because we can't expect to get more.\n\nYou should get going before it's too dark for a landing when you return. Remember that earlier today a large number of Japanese fighters were engaged by the 1st Squadron over Rangoon and that any ground attack planes you see might be heavily escorted.\n\nAnother thing- we are starting to make more and more ground attack missions, although so far it's been mostly 1st and 2nd Squadron. We'll get the call soon enough. Listen, you both know about Tom Cole. He's been officialy listed as missing and presumed dead. His plane was hit by enemy ack-ack while strafing. When we get the call for these missions, remember not to take chances. We lost too many planes and more importantly, too many pilots last month. I need all of you back after every mission, understood? Fine, get going.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n
