Name Double Trouble
Short Twice the number of enemies are attacking! Help 1st Squad intercept!\n\n
Description June 12th, 1942\nAVG airbase, Kunming, China\n1038 hours\n\n\nFor several hours now, we have been tracking a group of twin engined Japanese bombers, by way of our ground observers in the 'bamboo telegraph' system. Approximately twenty Japanese medium bombers with no escort made up that group when it  was first spotted. First Squadron has made a maximum effort flight, twenty aircraft, to put up a strong fighter screen, and ambush these Japanese raiders, at the place on your map indicated by the 'recon' marker.\n\nIn the last hour, another group of Japanese planes- this time single engined divebombers- has been spotted and tracked in the same general area. Just recently, this group has been identified as having escorts, and in addition, this group of planes is headed directly for the place 1st Squadron has flown to in preparation for it's interception of the medium bombers. The dive bombers are about two dozen strong with an unknown number of escorts, perhaps anywhere from three to five fighters.\n\nNow we have gotten word that the twin engined aircraft 1st Squadron plans to ambush is escorted by at least six fighters. The most recent reports concerning the twin engined group suggest that a  number of single engined aircraft- undoubtably the fighter escort- is flying above them. \n\nInstead of a carefully laid trap for at most two dozen unsuspecting bombers, we will face up to fifty enemy attack aircraft, and an unknown number of fighters, but potentially upwards of a dozen.\n\nThird Squadron will take a flight of four aircraft and assist 1st Squadron at the recon point marked on the map. A flight from 2nd Squadron have been diverted from their regular patrol and will also assist. Expect the enemy to be flying at almost 10000 feet. Check your oxygen equipment regularly, and remember that conditions at these altitudes are perfect for carburetor icing at this time of year. Follow the route shown on your map, engage at over 10,000 feet if possible, and get there quickly. Weather conditions are only fair and the clouds are beginning to increase; you can expect them at 3500 to 5000 feet today.\n\nThese two groups of enemy aircraft are not joining accidentally. This looks like a concerted effort for a pair of smaller raids to bring an overwhelming number of attack aircraft over a target. Only one target in this area warrants that type of attention- this airbase. As usual, flight leaders are a priority. Damage great enough to cause a bomber to drop its bombs early is as good as shooting it down in this case, and remember- our planes and pilots are not as easily replaceable as some old hangars and trucks. Your survival is paramount.\n\nThird squadron's leader on this mission will be Shark Red One. Any questions? Good, let's get you out to your aircraft.\n \n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
