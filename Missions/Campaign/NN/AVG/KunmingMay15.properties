Short Protect the C-47s from attack\n\n
Description May 15th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n1628 hours\n\nTwo groups of fighters have been spotted this morning; one to the South and one to our Northeast. It's unclear as to whether or not they are making fighter sweeps or actively seeking ground targets.\n\nSince we have a flight of four C-47s coming in from India soon, we are sending your flight of four out to escort them home.\n\nJapanese fighters don't like to attack our transports over Northern Burma because of the extremely high mountain ranges and poor weather. They'd much rather catch our cargo planes over the relatively low, flat terrain of China.\n\nThe C-47s will be approaching from the Northwest, and will need to be escorted all the way from the recon marker on your map to Kunming.\n\nTake-off by 1630 hours and follow your flight path to the rendezvous, then take our boys home. They will be flying at around 7500 to 8000 feet or higher, depending on how bad the weather gets- and it's bad enough right now. Rain squalls have been moving through the area all day and visiblity isn't good below 8000 feet. Clouds are relatively low today as well.\n\nReach at least 10000 feet before you make your rendezvous, or you may miss the C-47s altogether.\n\nWe've all heard the news that General Stillwell has left his HQ in Burma and moved to India- on foot! I don't know all the details, but that pretty much ends any hope of keeping the Japanese bottled up in Burma. That means they'll be pushing hard to break into China from the South- unless we can do anything about it. The papers also say that on the 11th, the German air force destroyed at least three British destroyers off of Crete. I guess the Mediterranean is where a lot of the action is lately. The island of Malta is in the news a lot...a US aircraft carrier ferried a bunch of Spitfires to it's defenders. I hope things out there aren't as bad as the Press makes out. \n\nI also have some bad news. As some of you already know, John Donovan didn't come back from a mission over Hanoi on the 12th. He was hit by ground fire and crashed, no parachute was seen. We'll have to fill in his slot with somebody, which brings me to an announcement Chennault's asked all the Squadron Leaders to make: \n\nSome US Army pilots will be joining us soon, on detached duty. They'll be flying missions with us in our aircraft for a while. I know a lot of us here in the 3rd are Navy and Marine pilots, but you might know some of the Army pilots who are coming in, let's see, I have a list here...alright...well, Captain Baumler's been here a few weeks already, you all know him..here we are. US Army pilots on Detached Service to the AVG...should be coming in by June at the latest...OK...\n\nBarnum, Butsch, Carney, Carter, Cluck, Dumas, Griffin, Hitchcock, Krippner, Masters, Mikeworth...next page...Minor, Mitchell,Scott, Smith, Stratton, Stuart, and Wilkinson. Not quite twenty pilots. They are new, but they know the P-40, and they aren't AVG but you can bet they know their jobs. We're going to teach them the way we do them over here, and maybe break them of a few bad habits they learned in tactical training in the Army.\n\nAlright, it's nearly take-off time. Let's get out to the flightline and get airborne.\n\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
