Name Last Intercept from Magwe
Short Conduct another bomber intercept; expect escorts\n\n
Description April 25th, 1942\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n0542 hours\n\nGood morning. I see some of you even managed to shave today.\n\nBefore we begin with this morning's first mission, we are getting ready to make another move. This time to Loiwing, not too far to the North of here. At Loiwing, we will pick up new P-40E aircraft, fresh from the States, and then we'll finally make our trip to China. There's a story behind this though: the 10th AF will be going to India, not to Burma as we had hoped. \n\nThis airbase is becoming increasingly popular as a target for the Japanese. Effective immediately, all RAF personnel and aircraft will be re-locating to Akyab, near India. To some of us here that seems like the  last gasp for the British in Burma. Japanese attacks continue to gain ground as they move North, and continuation of our efforts here seems more and more like an unnecessary risk. It's plain the Japanese will be able to close the Burma Road, the question is when. One last announcement- Frank Swartz died in a British hospital yesterday. He was hit by bomb fragments while racing for his plane during a raid. I know it's tough to bear another loss, but we'll make sure we gives the Japs what's coming to them.\n\nToday, we just hope to postpone the closing of the Burma Road for a little while longer.\n\nSince well before dawn today, we have been getting news of another inbound raid. Reports indicate that eighteen bombers, escorted by four fighters, are headed this way.\n\nIf you turn your attention to the map, you'll see that your interception point is shown by the recon marker. Fly to this point at around 8,000 feet. The skies are hazy today, unfortunately that won't burn off before you can make your attacks. Keep your eyes open out there. Clouds are low, and ground fog is present over much of the area you'll be operating in.\n\nFour planes will make the intercept. After the attack, follow the course indicated on your charts to Loiwing. From there, we'll exchange these old birds for new ones, and then fly to China to re-join with the other two squadrons.\n\nAny questions? OK, let's get to it!\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n
