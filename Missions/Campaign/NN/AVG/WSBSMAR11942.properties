Name Escort the Old Man
Short Escort Chennault to Rangoon\n
Description March 1st 1942\nMingladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n0705 hours\n\nEven though a thunderstorm has all but socked-in the area, we're still flying a mission today. Should be cake, except for the weather.\n\nKen Jernstedt will be flying Colonel Chennault down to Rangoon this morning. He and the Colonel arrived in that light twin-engined job the Gimo got for him last winter, after everyone else had turned in.\n\nThe rumor is that Chennault is going to talk with the Governor, Sir Reginald Doorman-Smith, who is about to leave Rangoon and head for India. The word also is that they will discuss our fuel reserve status, since the Burma Oil Company's supply is going to be destroyed before the Japanese get to it. That's the rumor at least.\n\nWe need a pair of escorts, and you two are it. I don't think the Japanese will send any patrols out in this soup, but it's better to be safe than sorry. Chennault also needs some pilots down in Rangoon for a little mission he wants flown after the weather clears. He'll tell you all about it later, I'm sure, but pack your overnight bag for this trip, you could be there a couple days. You must be pretty used to flying down there and back by now.\n\nThe flightplan is on your map. The weather is really bad, the worst I'd ever fly in. Hit the parking brakes in your plane as soon as you're on the runway, or the tail might get blown to the side by the wind, and watch out on your landing, this storm's a bad one.\n\nClouds are low, and nearly a full overcast is present from here to the coast. Get airborne, escort the Colonel to Rangoon, land and see him for further orders. Like I say, at least one of you will be there a few days to take care of something the Colonel needs doing. As usual, if you go to Rangoon, bring a pistol and watch your backs. See you when you get back.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n
