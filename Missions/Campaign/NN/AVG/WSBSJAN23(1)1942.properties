Description January 23rd, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n1040 hours\n\n\nOur Warning Net has given us word of a Japanese raid headed towards our area. The target is likely Rangoon and it's airbase. As many as forty medium bombers have been sighted. The enemy is at approximately 5,000 to 7,000 feet, approaching from the East. There may be two waves of attackers, or maybe two groups have been seperated, or perhaps one group is catching up to another. One group may even be fighters.\n\nTake off immediately, and head for Rangoon. A flight of RAF Brewsters is already on station there. Your route is on the map, and you will intercept at an altitude of around 8,000 feet or higher, if possible. You'll be using a four-ship formation. All our other planes except two are grounded pending repairs or on patrol elsewhere, and those two stay here to defend the base.\n\nLocal anti-aircraft defenses are not strong, while targets for the Japanese are many. There is an important railroad that leads to the north that needs to stay running. This is the most important area to defend right now, but also the port itself is vital to us and our Allies, and the warehouses along the port are full of material of war for the Chinese and British. To complicate matters, a civilian airliner is attempting to leave the port at this very minute. With any luck, they will be long gone when the Japanese arrive but keep your eyes peeled for it.\n\nIn any case, defending the port is your top priority. Rangoon must not burn. Good luck.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
