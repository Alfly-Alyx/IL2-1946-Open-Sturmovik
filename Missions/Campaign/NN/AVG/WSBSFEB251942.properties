Name Defend Mingaladon
Short Intercept recce\n
Description February 25th 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase Burma\n1135 hours\n\nWell, you're next up for patrol. We need to keep an effective defense up while 1st and 2nd Squadrons intercept a raid on Rangoon.\n\nYour flight will perform a standard close proximity patrol route. Check your maps. The Japanese have taken to conducting recon missions over our base while their bombers attack the port. \n\nThe RAF's radar isn't picking up any contacts, but we've seen that before even during a raid. Keep an eye peeled for any un-expected planes overflying the field at high altitude, and remember that the Japanese will probably escort their photo-recon planes with fighters. If you spot one, the destruction of  any recon types is your priority. The weather today is good with high clouds, should be plenty of visibility. Frank Losonsky mentioned that Singapore fell just the other day, he heard it on the radio and the papers confirmed it. It probably means more work for us around here. See you when you get back, good luck.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n
