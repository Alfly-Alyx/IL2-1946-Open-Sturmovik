Short Attack the nuisance raider\n\n
Description April 6th 1942\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n21:45 hours\n\n\nTake our stand-by aircraft, get airborne, and get that nuisance raider! While you were gone out camping and having a good time last week, a noisy twin engined light attack craft of some sort has bombed us practically every night with little result other than spoiling a good night's sleep. Enough is enough. I want you to end this guy's night flying career, but permanently!\n\nWe've scrounged up an old searchlight, and one of the mechanics rigged up a fifty caliber machine gun from one of our wrecks onto a tripod, but that won't be enough.  You'll just have to take care of it yourself. The sky's clear and the Moon should be out tonight- that's as good as it gets for visibility at night around here.\n\nThere's no way to tell much about the enemy except that the most noise is coming from the North right now. Some of the pilots and ground crew have run colored paper lanterns out along the runway so you'll find your way home easily enough. If you leave visual contact, radio the tower for a vector home. Remember that we're about 250 feet above sea level here. That's all the brief you're getting, we'll talk politics in the morning- after you go get us some peace and quiet!\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n
