Short Defend Lashio from a raid\n\n\n
Description March 16th, 1942\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n0730 hours\n\nOur next mission: Defense of Lashio. Since this is where the Burma Road starts, Japanese forces recognise that a large portion of the materials that begin their journey North to China spend some time in storage first, before the logistical problems of finding trains to carry it to the Chinese are solved. So, they frequently target warehousing areas in the City. Today it seems that we will intercept a raid with just that intention. Turn your attention to the map, please.\n\nClouds today are fairly low, and when you reach your intercept point, marked by the recon symbol, you may have trouble spotting the enemy at first. So be on your toes. We have gotten word that the raiders are less than a dozen or so, and are flying fast. This seems to be a new tactic by the Japanese to counter our patrols- relatively small fast bombing groups that get in and out as quickly as possible. They have been estimated as being at least 8,000 feet up and approaching from the Southwest; you'll intecept at over 10,000 if possible. Remember: target flight leaders. \n\nAfter Rangoon fell, the Japanese quickly seized the entire area right up to the Bay of Bengal, which has made British forces nervous. A possible Naval assault on India is their worry, so troops that otherwise might be available in our are are being held in reserve to the West, near Imphal, India. I hear some Chinese forces may still be available, but that seems like a rumor.\n\nWe can't do much about that from here, but I mention it as a reminder: Japan is still on the move, and we are still outnumbered. They haven't lost heart, not even after the losses we inflicted on them in January. They are still very much in control of this theatre. You'll be relieved to learn that their advance North hasn't been as quick as their advance East was so we should be quite safe here unless they bomb us- which, the RAF staff here tells me, has happened twice. Even if they do advance, the RAF has become quite proficient at blowing up bridges from the air to slow down the Japanese attack.\n\nEven though Japan seems to be pushing ahead on all fronts, the newspapers say that Rommel's famed Afrika Corps was stopped cold in it's tracks in it's attempts to sweep back across North Africa. The British 8th Army took a real beating but came back strong. I guess it's no surprise that the Brits don't have the manpower available to build up their strength here- they have plenty of fighting all over the world to worry about.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n\n\n
