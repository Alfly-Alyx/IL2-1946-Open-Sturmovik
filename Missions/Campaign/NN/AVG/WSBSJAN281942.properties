Short Ambush a large raid headed for Rangoon. 16 Hawk 81A-2s versus 40+ Japanese bombers\n\n
Description January 28th, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n1254 hours\n\nYour orders for this morning ~\n\nSurprise and destroy a large raid headed for Rangoon. Their predicted course will bring them to the recon point marked on your map; rendezvous with the four other flights already there, and await orders if the enemy is not sighted. Your altitude while on station here should be no less than 10,000 feet, so pay attention to your oxygen regulators! I don't want to have to remind you again that they need to be checked and re-checked in flight.\n\nThis will be a maximum effort operation for us: All available planes will conduct the intercept, and we will have help from the 1st and 2nd Squadron.  All other aircraft are either grounded for repairs or have been destroyed. \n\nNo bomber escort has been sighted. Over forty bombers of at least two types have been spotted and tracked since 0600 this morning. They are at around 8,000 feet and holding course, approaching from the East by Northeast.\n\nThe remaining RAF units in this region have taken a real beating. They are able to put up nothing more than their standing combat patrol over the harbor area- just three Hurricanes. Toungoo is depleted of aircraft, and all surviving bombers assigned there have been re-assigned to the main base at Rangoon to be better protected. Toungoo still has a viable emergency field, and the RAF is maintaining a small ground crew there for just this purpose. Fuel, repair and food, but no hospital services are avaible there. We do not expect Toungoo to come under attack during this raid.\n\nAssets in Rangoon that are vital have not changed, although those assets are becoming fewer and fewer.  In regards to the city, the locals have begun to abandon their homes. Workers are leaving their jobs and goods are piling up on the docks. We'll have to start sending some of our own people down there to secure our supplies. Sidearms are required in the city, after violence against British servicemen has been reported, and fires are begining to spread after the latest bombing raids because almost no fire fighting services are active now. There's even a rumor that they'll just unlock the gates of the zoo, and maybe even free all the inmates in the prison if things get worse. Be on your guard when in the city from now on. \n\nOne other announcement- Louis Hoffman was killed in combat on the 26th. His patrol flight ran into some enemy fighters. Hoffman took on five of them alone and was shot down. He was one of the best pilots we had. If you still have any illusions about being able to dogfight the Japanese, ask yourself if you're a better pilot than he was. Do I make myself clear?\n\nAt least the mail came in today, and all of you with bounties claimed and confirmed will be receiving verification of the funds arriving in your accounts back home. The newspapers say that the British and Indian forces in Burma are on the move. British Field Marshal Sir Archibald Wavell says the Japanese are on the verge of over-extending themselves in Burma and the time is ripe for an offensive, and that General Percivale is retreating to Singapore. Could turn into a siege. Oh, by the way, the Stateside press also has given our group a nickname- the Flying Tigers.\n\n The weather should be fair and visibility quite good on this mission. We have a real chance to even the odds over the port today if we swat enough bombers down. Another note of interest is that our 'bamboo telegraph' has reported Japanese two seat biplanes in the area east of here, near the areas under Japanese control. Usually these are training aircraft, but apparently around here, their rugged construction makes them good ground attack aircraft. You shouldn't spot many of them at the altitudes you'll be at today- no oxygen in one of those rattletraps. Good luck!\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin"\n\n\n\n
