Name II
Short Japanese are attacking twice in one day\n\n
Description January 23rd, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n1515 hours\n\nWe just got an another alert- Japanese Type 99 bombers are again en route to Rangoon. They are about 25 minutes away from the port- just enough time to scramble and catch them. For once, the RAF radar is tracking them perfectly. There appear to be two groups of bombers, well escorted by two groups of fighters, type unknown.\n\nThe weather is still good and you have plenty of visibility. Fly a patrol circuit around Rangoon as shown on your flight map. The enemy is coming in from the North-west of the city at around 8,000 feet.\n\nWe want two groups up right away- Shark Red flight from our Squadron will fly with a four ship formation from Second Squadron. Also, I have some bad news to break - Bert Christman got killed today. He and some other 2nd Squadron Pilots were on patrol. They tangled with Japanese fighters, and Bert got hit and bailed out. His squad-mates saw him get strafed while he was in his chute. The Japs aren't giving any quarter. Some of the men from 2nd Squadron are out right now looking for his body in the rice paddies. Remember what happened to Bert when you're out there today, because the Japanese won't take you prisoner, they'll kill you. \n\nAnyway, when you get back, ask Danny Hoyle if you can borrow the copy of the New York Times he just got from one of the Brits. There's a story about a group of US Marines holding off an entire Japanese invasion force at an Island called Wake. The Marines lost the island in the end though- too many Japanese to handle. Sounds familiar. \n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin"\n\n
