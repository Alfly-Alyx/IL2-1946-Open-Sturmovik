Short Goodbye, USMC, hello AVG\n
Description July 3rd, 1941\nUSN aircraft carrier USS Saratoga, CV3\njust southeast of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii\n1735 hours\n\nAlright, Marine. I don't know just how you managed to get out of the Corps and into a new job overseas, but my orders come right from the top: your papers have come through, and you're as good as free to go. But I'm still your Squadron Leader and you're mine until some Navy Commander named Irvine sees you on shore and signs for you. He's on Ford Island right now, waiting for you and a few other men.\n\nI need you and these other goldbricks here to deliver some F2A-2s to the Navy maintenance pool on the Island. Don't worry; the planes fly just fine. They have machine guns from a lot that's being pulled for inspection today is all, and the Captain doesn't want to pull into port just to drop you four off, so you'll be our delivery boys.\n\nTake off and then land on Ford Island, bring the planes and logs to the Officer of the Day, and then report to Commander Irvine. Somebody in Operations will know where he is.\n\nGood luck with your new jobs. I can already guess that you've volunteered for that group that's going to defend the Burma Road. They won't let me sign up, so give 'em hell for me, and don't forget that you'll always be a United States Marine! Hey- when you see Irvine, ask him about this fishy pact between England and the Russians. Sounds like it's a bunch of bull to me, those newspapers can't even get the weather right.\n
