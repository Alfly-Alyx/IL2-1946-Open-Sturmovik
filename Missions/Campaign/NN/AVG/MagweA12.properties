Description April 12th 1942\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n0755 hours\n\nGood morning.\n\nWe have just received word from HQ in China: Japanese troops are again pushing Northwards. We have been ordered to provide support for British and Chinese troops defending the Irrawaddy basin. Today we will attack enemy troop and vehicles concentrations approaching a key river bridge. Please turn your attention to the map.\n\nAs you can see, our mission today will be right at the furthest reaches of Japanese expansion, to our West. Unfortunately, we are almost out of bombs, and will not be taking any with us this morning. So that means strafing only, low level attacks.\n\nThe Japanese are approaching the town that commands the river bridge shown. Units of British troops with Chinese support are preparing for an attack right now. They expect enemy contact in less than twenty minutes. Enemy advances will be from a westerly direction, with friendly troops remaining more or less in place just to the west of the bridge itself.\n\nGeneralissimo Chiang has requested close support so that his troops can have their morale boosted by seeing our planes with their insignias. Seems like a silly way to get shot down to me, so don't press your luck today. Do the job, and get out of there. We expect Japanese troop movements to be approaching down the main road that leads to the town from the Northwest.\n\nWeather this morning is fairly poor with low clouds, but it might clear up by the time you reach the target. Enemy anti-aircraft guns are likely to be present in the target area, and small arms are still a threat.\n\nGood luck\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n\n
