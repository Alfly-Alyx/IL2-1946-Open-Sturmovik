Description March 15, 1942\nNorthern Burma\nAVG airbase Magwe\n1200 hours\n\nWelcome to Magwe. I'm glad all of you made it. As you may have noticed by now, this is an active RAF aerodrome; home of No. 45 Squadron flying the Blenheim bomber. Our location here means excellent opportunities for catching Japanese raids on Lashio well before they reach the city. Also, we can make some extreme long distance raids of our own on Japanese airfields in Thailand, if we can identify them.\n\nA word about conditions here. Emergency landing strips are few and far between. I want you all to review your emergency procedures, especially those on wheels-up landings in the field. The many areas of jungle and forest will mean that an emergency landing will most likely be near a river in most areas of this region. Some of them are deep and swift. These aircraft will float for less than two seconds; getting out of a ditched plane quickly is key. See El Loomis for swim trunks if you think you might be taking a dip. Another safety tip: Chennault has advised all pilots to remove the blood chit from the back of their jackets, and sew it into the back of the inside lining, instead. It has been pointed out that the blood chit makes an excellent target for Japanese snipers, and the chit can be shown to a local farmer just as easily when you remove the jacket. Understood? Fine.\n\nLet's get to business. Our warning net has informed us that we can expect some Japanese dive bombers this afternoon, probably before 1300 hours. The enemy's advance of ground forces south of here has come too close for comfort and British forces need time to organize a counter attack. Our fuel and oil reserves to the southeast are essential to any action British forces will take against the Japanese if they can push through. Defend them, they are most likely the target of this raid. \n\nThe weather today is going to get poor, but that won't stop the enemy. Expect rain squalls and clouds at about 3,000 feet after 1300 hours.\n\nEnemy strength is unknown, but from what we can gather it is not a large raid. Rain storms to the south have hindered more precise visual contact with the raiders, but we guess they are under a dozen.\n\nThe Recon marker on your map indicates where you should loiter in order to make your intercept, directly over a village near the Irrawaddy called Peku. My  estimate is that you should see the enemy by 1210, approaching from your Southwest.\n\nGet airborne and protect our petrol dumps. You will be part of a flight of two today. Remember that RAF Buffalo squadrons may be present in our area, and ground watcher stations in the area should not be mis-identified as Japanese forces.\n\nGood hunting.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n
