Description May 4th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n1204 hours\n\nWell here's your chance to get your hands on one of the new birds finally. The P-40E isn't that much different from the old P-40s, but there are definitely not enough to go around. You'll be sharing number 103 with a few other pilots. She's got six .50 machine guns, a more powerful engine, and can carry some nice big bombs that the Chinese have been hoarding. I know you've studied the flight manual, and it's a nice clear day. I've had some of the armorers rig  her up with a bomb, and the ship's all set to fly.  How'd you like to get some seat time in her, and practice your dive bombing? You can see the local sights, too.\n\nAlright, good. We do our practicing out on lake Dianchi, on the Old Man's orders. He doesn't want to spook the locals too much, and they can't tell our planes from the Japanese sometimes. No sense causing a panic I guess, so we do all our target practice out on the lake.\n\nRemember, dive at around sixty degrees. Anything more than that, and there's a real chance the bomb will strike your propeller. Also bear in mind that these E models are real screamers in a dive. I've had plenty of buffet around 400 mph indicated, and one of the pilots in 2nd Squadron lost an aileron at around 430 mph on the gauge. Don't go so fast you break the ship apart, OK?\n\nYour target is a leaky barge with some old oil containers on it. It's all set up, about 500 yards offshore, in the Northwest corner of the lake. Here,  I'll mark it on your map. Can't miss it. In case you need glasses, we also have a small crew out on the shore, with a nice big arrow pointing towards the barge, with range marked out. If you can't find that, I have the phone number of a good eye doctor you should talk to!\n\nYou're all set, leave whenever you like. This is a short hop, so you'll be back within the hour\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
