Description May 1st, 1942\nSalween River Gorge, Eastern Burma\n0953 hours\n\n                           ~!WARNING!~\n                            *AIR  START*              \n\nYou have left Kunming a few hours after dawn to escort a flight of P-40Es from 1st Squadron AVG, the "Adam and Eves". Their target: Enemy troop movements in the Salween River Gorge.\n\nMentally, you review your briefing from a few hours earlier and consult your kneepad  for your charts and notes on the mission\n\nDuty: lead flight of four H81A-2s, escorting four P-40Es laden with 1,000 pound bombs. P-40Es will attack and destroy road traffic in the Salween Gorge area. After attack, and after elimination of any aerial threat, proceed South following the River, and rendezvous with 1st Squadron P-40Es at the lake to the Southeast, indicated by the Recon marker on your map, where your mission will be considered Completed. 1st squadron P-40Es will be on your left, and below you as you enter the Salween area.\n\nAltitude and flight path: 10,000 feet minimum, approaching target from North, continuing South, and then Southeast\n\nEnemy activity, air: usually moderate. Fighter patrols are common and skilled\n\nEnemy activity, ground: moderate. Convoys heading North to staging areas in preparation for attack on China are frequent\n\nAAA concentration: variable. Some AVG flights have encountered heavy flak, others have been opposed by only small arms fire\n\nLocal weather: hazy. Clouds at approximately 1500-2500 feet\n\nNotes: the Salween Gorge is a deep rift in the Burmese landscape, reaching a depth of nearly 7,000 feet, with a valley floor less than a mile wide in some areas. The Salween River runs roughly North-South, with tributaries and lakes also present in the area. Irregular cuts and steep mountain walls are common to the area; watch your altimeter and pay attention to the sides of the Gorge or you won't be coming home. Almost the whole area is under Japanese control.\n\nJapan hopes to make their advance through the Salween River Gorge, one of three in their conquest of Burma, the one that funnels troops directly into China.\n\nTwo Chinese armies and the AVG are practically all that stand in their way. The AVG will make disruption of troop movements through the Gorge a Top Priority for all three Sqaudrons, equal in importance to defending Kunming.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n            \n\n\n
