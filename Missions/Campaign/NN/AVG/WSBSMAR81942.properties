Short Attack ground traffic to slow the Japanese advance\n\n
Description March 8th, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n0840 hours\n\nYour map tells the story, gentlemen; Rangoon is as good as taken. RAF interdiction of enemy action in this area is all but suspended, and we are the last air support in the area that can mount any attack. However, continuing our efforts from this base is impossible. Preparations for our re-deployment are complete. This is your last mission from Mingaladon and all facilities here have been either destroyed or disabled to deny the Japanese their use. \n\nWhile this must seem like our defeat, remember that a real defense of Burma, even a small part of it like the Rangoon area, is impossible without ground forces, and we have no control over how the ground campaign is run. The world has seen what a determined group of pilots and their support staff can do- the last ten weeks over Rangoon has already become famous.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill has publicly said that our action over Burma is no less a great Feat of Arms as was the RAF's in the Battle of Britain. Being put on a par with 'The Few' is not afforded to the losers in a Battle, be sure of that. The aerial struggle here was won by the AVG.\n\nBut for right now, our aim is to throw a hitch into Japan's plans again. Let's study the map.\n\nNote the two Recon markers near the area of greatest Japanese advance. These markers indicate the routes within the network of roadways that Japanese forces are exploiting. This is the main reason their ground advance is such a speedy affair. The area is usually crawling with troop carrying trucks and other vehicles.\n\nSince we are the last of our squadron to relocate, I want to take this last opportunity to strike at the Japanese from this base.\n\nTwo aircraft will fly the route shown at about 3,000-4,000 feet. Keep an eye out for enemy fighters, because they must be patrolling the area. Your goal here is to take out some Japanese ground traffic. Every truck destroyed delays their advances here, and maybe we can give Allied forces still in Rangoon the breathing room they need to destroy or remove the remaining supplies still in the city.\n\nAfter your attacks, proceed to the temporary airbase shown; Mingaladon airbase will cease to be operational for combat after this flight out today. All other combat aircraft have either left for the flight to Kunming, have been taken apart to be trucked North,  or are being destroyed and abandoned here. \n\nFrom this temporary airbase to the East, we will re-fuel, spend the night, and then proceed to Magwe tomorrow morning, where we plan to conduct an elastic withdrawal North to China over the next few weeks. \n\nGround crews at the temporary airbase have orders to be long gone after 0945 this morning, so watch your clocks- if you loiter around the target area too long you'll find that service personnel, their fuel and tools at the airbase have left, and you'll probably end up a guest of one of Japan's finest military prisons. Remember that- 0945 is H-hour for arriving at the temporary airbase where you will end this mission.\n\nLocal weather is fine and clear with high clouds, making for excellent visibility for you- and your targets-  so be careful, I want both of you to make it back.  Every pilot and every plane are vital. As always, your personal survival is more important than one more wrecked truck or another aerial victory. Also keep in mind that the area you will be operating in is no longer under Allied or even Burmese control- it's Japan's now. Watch out for anti-aircraft defenses.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
