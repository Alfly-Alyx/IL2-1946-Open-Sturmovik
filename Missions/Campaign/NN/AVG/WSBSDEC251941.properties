Description December 25th, 1941\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n1203 hours\n\nMerry Christmas\n\n A group of twenty-plus Japanese twin engined bombers are headed straight for us. They are escorted; type and number of pursuit planes accompanying the bombers is unknown. Have a look at the map- the recon marker just to our South-east shows were we guess you'll first spot them. Altitude is unknown. We have had very little warning; they could be here in ten minutes or less.\n\nTwo flights of P-40s and one flight of RAF Brewsters will make the intercept. Be careful and watch what you shoot at, we might have some of our pilots ferrying in new Curtiss CW-21s from Loiwing if the weather is bad enough up there. Don't mistake them for the Japanese, and remember what we've been teaching here: Dive, Squirt, Pass, Run- dive on him from altitude, hit him hard, pass below, get out of range, and repeat! Is that clear?\n\nWe already have four P-40s airborne,  following a flight of RAF fighters to Rangoon, in case another raid is taking place. \n\nLet's go, out to the flight line, armorers and ground crew have your planes ready. Red flight will lead. Time to earn your pay.\n\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n\n
