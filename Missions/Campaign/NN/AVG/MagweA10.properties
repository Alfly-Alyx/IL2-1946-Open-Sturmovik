Short Defend CAMCO\n\n
Description April 10th 1942\t\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n0945 hours\n\nWe need four ships over the area of Loiwing, right away. Six Japanese fighters were seen orbitting the region of the CAMCO repair facility and the Loiwing airfield. Past experience shows us this is a prelude to a strafing attack.\n\n Between the railway depot, the CAMCO buildings, and the airbase, there's too many targets for the Japs to resist. We can't afford many more setbacks here, so swat those crates down pronto. Your flight plan is marked out on the map. The weather's not too bad today which should help you spot the enemy early, and maybe catch him with his pants down as he concentrates on strafing.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n\n
