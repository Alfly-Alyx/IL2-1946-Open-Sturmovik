Short Occupy a small, hidden AVG airbase behind enemy lines. Attack targets of opportunity en route\n
Description Burma\nApril 1st 1942\n1840 hours\n\n                  ~!Warning! Air Start!~\n\n\nToday you have begun a trip to the South of \nMagwe, to an area well behind enemy lines\n\nYour task for the next few days will be an extended detachment from the main group of the AVG in Burma.\n\nRAF airfields in various degrees of completion are still common in this area of Burma. You will take advantage of the over-confidence of the Japanese forces, by operating out of an abandoned RAF emergency airstrip in their rear area, that the Japanese have not yet detected\n\nYour goal is the disruption of enemy troop and cargo movements in the area. After a few days, the Japs will surely catch on to what's happening, but until then you should be fairly safe\n\nYou check your map again to get your bearings in the gathering dusk...the area of your operations is now in view\n\nJapanese river and road traffic is to be expected. Some fighter cover should be in the area too, but they will not be expecting you here, in an area that their Army has just taken over from the British. Signs of recent fighting will certainly be evident, but friendly troops will not- this area belongs to Japan\n\nIn fact, you are uncomfortably aware that the only safe haven you will have is an area immediately around your airfield, and that you will be safe only so long as you remain undetected while on the ground.\n\nOn the plus side, you are reassured by the extra handle in your cockpit- a bomb release lever.\n\nJury-rigged by your tireless ground crews, this will allow you to take advantage of some of the RAF ordnance left behind at the emergency strip. The Japanese also won't expect you to be dive bombing.  But remember "Tex" Hill's warning not to dive at more than a 70* angle while dropping your bomb, or it may hit your own propeller!\n\nToday you also are enjoying a rare treat- an escort, provided by two Chinese H-75s. Whatever modifications the Chinese made to those Hawks to make them flying gas-cans seems to have worked, but you shudder to think about how large a fireball they'd make if hit by ground fire\n\nThe extra weight of the bomb you're carrying now seems to beg you to find a target. Your orders are clear: attack targets of opportunity, so don't save bombs, drop them! Maybe you will spot a likely candidate for explosion on the way to your new base...you hope so, as you've never practised landing with a live bomb under your wings! Undoubtably some Jap tank or truck will present itself to you and your squad-mate as the two of you make your way to your temporary base behind enemy lines. A few other AVG pilots have made there way there to prepare for your arrival, and to set out some flares at the airbase, so you can find it in the semi-darkness, but they will be flying out tonight, to make the Japanese think any planes they see during your arrival have flown away...\n\n**Plater should select '000Player' as skin**\n\n
