Short take a trip to Rangoon\n
Description February 25th 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n1820 hours\n\nWell, thanks for volunteering. Everybody else seems more interested in seeing what they can scrounge in Rangoon before the Japanese show up. I'm glad somebody has the brains to figure out that we'll need to keep our eyes peeled for an attack while we salvage what supplies we can from the port.\n\nAs you know, Rangoon is turning into a ghost-town. Many residents have fled the city. Fires are spreading out of control because there's nobody to fight the flames, and looters are roaming the streets. What you might not know is that there's a group of militant Burmese that have been suspected of whipping up anti-British sentiment. These so-called "Thirty Comrades" number lots more than their name suggests. The Brits tell us that they are a puppet group controlled by the Japanese. Remember what happened to Tom Trumble? Well the locals who tried to kill him thought he was British, and wanted a little revenge. Seems some of them blame the British for what's happened to Rangoon. So- pack your pistol in your overnight bag for this trip, and remember- any civilian you see could be a Japanese agent, even some of the local monks could be Japanese in disguise.\n\nWell, enough local flavor, let's get down to business. You'll be flying alone down to Rangoon tonight. There's a bit of a haze coming off the ocean and low-lying areas, and fog will roll in later, as usual. Clouds will likely be quite low tonight.\n\nFor now, your mission is just to get your plane down to Rangoon. The airfield next to the port is almost deserted, so we have been using it as a supply dump. With the Japanese so close to over-running British ground forces, and given Rangoon's strategic value, we are trying to get as much as we can from the docks and warehouses before the city falls completely into chaos. Trucks, crates, barrels of molasses, lumber, sacks of grain, you name it, it's just sitting on the docks where ship's crews have dumped it before they leave, usually as fast as they can. There's even a few shiny new Buicks down there at the port, just sitting around. We don't really expect any more supply ships to come to the city, and we need those supplies. The trouble is, nobody is getting the supplies to us anymore.\n\nSo- we're doing it all ourselves. We've got a few C-47s with plenty of men and armed guards down there, and they are taking anything they can get ahold of from the docks, trucking it to the airbase, packing up the C-47s, and getting out as quickly as they can. You will provide fighter cover in the event a strafing raid takes place overnight. That means stay alert! You will be the one and only fighter capable of tackling any Japanese that come around tonight. Stay near your plane, and stay away from the RAF Officer's Club at the base. Tomorrow, once they are done loading up the C-47s, you'll refuel and escort the transports back here. Get going while you still have some light.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n
