Description December 8th, 1941\t\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n0955 hours\n\nPearl Harbor has been attacked by the Japanese. The Navy and Army got hit pretty hard but I don't know all the details. This base is now on war alert.\n\nOK people, pay attention. Ground personnel have all been issued gasmasks, tin hats, and firearms. You'll get the same, but first I want you to all read the field order that's come down from the Old Man, and the memorandum for the day:\n                                       \n                                           F.A.V.G\n                                           Point "A" Burma\n                                           8 December 1941\n                                           0945 o'clock\n\nFIELD ORDERS )\n                                    :\nNumber 2.               )\nMAPS:\n1. (a) JAPAN has declared war on the UNITED STATES and GREAT BRITAIN\n2. This command will be on the alert twenty-four (24) hours daily and be prepared to defy hostile operations of the enemy.\n   (a) The 3rd Squadron will constitute the assault echelon\n   (b) The 2nd Squadron will constitute the support ecchelon\n   (c) The 1st Squadron will constitute the reserve echelon\n3.X.

No member of this command will leave this post without permission from the commanding officer.\n2. In case of air raid alarms, administrative and operations personnel will gather all important documents and remove them to a place of safety. In case of a normal alarm, clerical personnel will repair to the main road, taking the first transportation to come along. In case of an urgent alarm, personnel will clear building and repair to the jungle, lying down flat, utilizing whatever shelter may be available\n3. Strict watch will be kept for enemy parachute troops at all times.\n\n\n\nIs that clear? We are at war with the Japanese. If I don't see you with a pistol on your hip, I'd better see a rifle in your hands. Understood? Sandell and Newkirk are telling their boys the same thing right now: guns, masks, helmets. Get to it. We'll also be putting up a patrol on the double, and that means right the hell now. Shark Red flight has the duty. Weather is poor with relatively low clouds this morrning. RAF patrols are out, and a flight of transports is coming in. Don't shoot at friendlies.  The new paintjobs on our planes should help with identifying friend from foe.\n\nMove it! Patrol route three, it's marked on your map for those with short memories.\n\nPlayer should select  "000Player" as skin\n
