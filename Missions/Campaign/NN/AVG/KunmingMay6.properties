Name Joyride
Short whaddaya mean, no parachute?!\n\n\n
Description May 6th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n1100 hours\n\nNice day, huh? Hey, how'd you like to take a little joyride in a Jap plane the Chinese captured? Sure, I'm serious, they found it last month on the beach opposite Hainan island, and fixed it up. It's an I-97. Of course it's safe! Half of the mechanics at CAMCO in Loiwing were Chinese, they know what they are doing. The Old Man wants somebody to take it for a spin, see what it's like. You're volunteered!\n\nWell here we are, what do you think? A little small, yeah...well to be honest, there's a catch...you're probably too big to fit in there with a parachute. Oh, don't be such a crybaby, you'll be fine. How many hours behind the stick do you have? Well that's plenty to fly this little crate, get in for Pete's sake! Watch your head. See? The thing looks brand new.\n\nAlright, now here's the mag switches...main cut-off, fuel gauge, engine temperature is here, airspeed is here, you'll figure out the rest. The guns are loaded, don't do anything stupid.\n\nOK, have fun, and don't ground loop the damn thing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
