Name Nothing changes
Short Rangoon is again under Japanese aerial attack. Defend the port and the ships in it.\n\n
Description January 29th, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG Airbase, Burma\n0730 hours\n\nGlad to see you've had enough sleep, boys, because we're on an intercept this morning. Grab some toast and coffee and I'll breif you as we walk to your ships. By the way, radio broadcasts in Japan have formally labelled our group 'Bandits' and subject to immediate military Justice when-not "if"- captured. I guess we have made something of a problem for the Japanese. What does 'immediate military justice' mean? Oh, you know, a fair trial followed by a firing squad.\n\nAt 0530 this morning, our 'bamboo telegraph' sent word of a raid inbound from the Southeast, hugging the coast. Some heavy bombers were sighted, along with assorted other attack craft. Estimated strength is from eighteen to twenty-four aircraft.  We have received word that they've changed course and are apparently headed for Rangoon. Since ground observers have lost sight of them near the coast, we assume they will be approaching over water. The RAF's radar has failed to locate them, but you can bet that shipping in the harbor will most likely be the prime target.\n\nAn RAF Buffalo squadron is currently flying patrol over the port. You will aid them. They will patrol just to the North of your area of responsibility. Your patrol area is to the Southwest of the port itself, and your route will be at an altitude of no less than 10,000 feet once you arrive at your patrol sector. \n\nThe local RAF aerodrome just to the Southwest of the port is also a likely target for the Japanese. Toungoo is a better choice for an emergency landing.\n\nTwo British warships are in port. One is making for open sea, the other is staying in port to aid in the defense. Don't laugh, the Cruiser that is escaping is very important to any defense we'll make against the Japanese landing troops in this theatre.\n\nYou'll be flying in a four ship formation to the port, callsign Shark Red flight.   \n\nWeather conditions are good, with scattered clouds from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. Your targets are flying at nearly 9,000 feet so pay attention to your oxygen pressure if the fight stays up there. We are running out of high pressure oxygen bottles, so don't forget to turn off the damned things under twelve thousand feet.\n\nSee you when you get back, and good luck.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
