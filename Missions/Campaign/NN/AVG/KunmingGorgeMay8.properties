Short Surprise ground forces in the Salween Gorge\n
Description May 8th, 1942\nSalween River Gorge, Eastern Burma\n1757 hours\n\n                           ~!WARNING!~\n                            *AIR  START*              \n\nYou are leading a flight of four P-40Es on a ground attack mission today. Your late arrival means that it will be dark when you return to Kunming. To take your mind off of the night landing that awaits you, you review your mission details as you enter the Salween Gorge:\n\n\nThe complete fall of Burma has left it open to rapid Japanese advancement. The Salween gorge has become a bottleneck of troops and vehicles as the area sees more and more troops pass through. Rest areas, refueling depots, and other needed facilities are being hastily erected by the Japanese. \n\nToday you will bomb and strafe ground vehicles in the heart of the gorge. They seem to be concentrated lately, in a town marked by the 'destroy ground' marker on your map.\n\nHeavy ground activity should be expected today. The Japanese aren't used to being attacked by air this late in the day but you still should be wary of them. A standing air patrol by the enemy is not expected, but nearby airfeilds should be completed and capable of sending out fighters to oppose you.\n\nAAA activity could be heavy. Locating and knocking out enemy flak is a high priority.\n\nVisiblity in the area seems good, with areas of mist cropping up near the valley floor.\n\n\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n            \n\n\n
