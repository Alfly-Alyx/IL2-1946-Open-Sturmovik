Description May 23rd, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n1421 hours\n\nI know you boys don't like these missions, but we have another ground attack job today. Let's study the map.\n\nChennault has promised the Generalissimo  to give close support to his ground troops, and that's what we'll do today. As you can see, our mission this afternoon takes us all the way across the IndoChina Border. Now, you all know what a beating we handed Tojo at the Salween. But that was just his biggest chance at China. Two other Japanese armies  are trudging through the jungle, trying to get into China. A fair number of them come up the rails from Thailand, too. These troops are still giving Chinese forces problems at the border, and their train transport is our target today.\n\nWe've learned the hard way that the trains they use are armed. You'll be getting plenty of lead thrown at you so be careful. Shark Red One will lead a flight of four P-40Es laden with bombs, and fly over the border on the route shown. At the bombing marker, start searching for rail traffic. You're bound to find some. Any train you see is fair game. There might also be Japanese convoys on the roads, too, and some of them could carry anti-aircraft weapons, and all of them know how to shoot a rifle at a plane, so watch it.\n\nWeather today isn't so bad, but there's a haze that could make visual contact with your target a problem. Clouds are scattered at about 3500 feet.\n\nChennault has asked me to tell you that we've lost another pilot. Yesterday Bob Little was shot down over Burma. Bob flew more missions than any two of you combined, and had over ten victories; he was a pro. Don't get over-confident out there. These ground attack missions are dangerous and I expect every plane that goes out to come back\n\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
