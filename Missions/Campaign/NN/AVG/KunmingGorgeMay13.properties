Short Sweep fighters from the Salween gorge\n\n
Description May 13th, 1942\nSalween River Gorge, Eastern Burma\n0938 hours\n\n                         ~!WARNING!~\n                         *AIR  START*       \n\nJapanese aerial defenses in the Salween area have been strengthened over the last month. Hastily constructed airfields, inactive until recently, have become home to several units of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. Their goal: to drive the AVG from the Salween Gorge.\n\nWith the added fighter presence in the region, the AVG has begun to sweep the area of fighters prior to a bombing raid.\n\nThis morning you are flying just such a mission.\n\nAs the gorge looms near, you recall the mission briefing and check your oxygen:\n\n"Twelve aircraft will sweep the Salween Gorge today for enemy fighters. He will almost certainly come up to oppose you, and you also can expect standing fighter patrols at nearly 10000 feet. You'll be approaching from the North, as usual. Please examine your maps.\n\nEnemy AAA is still expected in the heart of the gorge. All our attempts to eliminate it have so far failed. Expect flak as you near your sweep area.\n\nAt least two different units of Japanese fighters are now stationed in or near the Gorge. Ground traffic will probably be light; the Japanese have learned to travel at night in the area. Local small arms may pose some ground-to-air threat, but you shouldn't be getting low enough for it to matter.\n\nThe weather is another thing entirely. A storm front is predicted to move into much of eastern Burma, and the weather is expected to be very heavy in the area of the Salween Gorge. Expect rain, thunderheads, and even electrical storms on this mission. Elsewhere, you should have unlimited ceiling and visiblity.\n\nRemember you're going to be getting low on fuel on this mission. Also remember you're behind enemy lines; the front is marked on the map. If you are in trouble, break off! Pilots and planes are still precious.\n\nYour route is indicated on the map. Enter the Gorge well at over 10,000 feet if possible; the weather may influence this. You will approach from the North, following the Salween as it runs South, ignoring it's tributary to the West. Sweep the heart of the Gorge, and begin your egress at the point marked "recon" on the Southwest of the map. Assemble here for completion of your sweep, after all enemies are eliminated. Then procede back to the North on the route shown, over friendly lines, to your primary Recon point. Good luck."\n\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as aircraft skin**\n\n            \n\n\n
