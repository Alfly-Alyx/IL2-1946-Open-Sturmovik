Name strafed
Short Mingaladon is being strafed\n
Description January 4th, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG Airbase, Burma\n12:05 hours\n\nWe have another air raid coming in. RAF radar is able to track this one, but they will be here in only minutes. Seems like only fighters judging from their height and speed. Perhaps a dozen of them, approaching from the South-east at around 1,000 feet.\n\nAll available aircraft from all Squadrons will participate. Most of 2nd and 1st Squadron are patrolling right now, so it's mostly up to us today. RAF fighter strength is also patrolling at Rangoon and is not available.\n\nThe only news we have from HQ in China is that there was another accident. Marion Baugh, one of the flight instructors, was killed. They didn't send any details.\n\n OK, there's Leo from Operations, he's signalling that you'd better get airborne. They must almost be here. Good luck.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n
