Short Pontoon? We doan need no stinking pontoon\n\n
Description May 29th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n0500 hours\n\nHope you're awake enough to take off in five minutes. Let's make this quick, alright? Good.\n\nEven though the Chinese have demolished every bridge across the many rivers and streams near the border, the Japanese keep rebuilding them. We just had a few destroyed before dawn, by Chinese bombers. The dawn patrol that just landed reports that there's a mass of Japanese trucks heading down a main road, directly to one of these bridges we wrecked last night. Chennault seems to think they are either repairing one of the bridges that got bombed inadequately, or they are making their own.\n\nEither way, we want to put a stop to that! Take a look here at the map.\n\nFollow this route shown. You'll be in a two plane flight of P-40Es, with large demolition bombs. We want you to plaster those Japanese troops at the ground attack point shown. If there's a bridge there that's still standing, knock that out, too.\n\nThe weather is turning fine but the morning haze has just formed. When you reach the target area, beware of anti-aircraft defenses. You'd better hurry up and get in the air.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
