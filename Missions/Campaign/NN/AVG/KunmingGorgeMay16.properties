Description May 16th, 1942\nSalween River gorge, Eastern Burma\n1650 hours\n\n                             ~!WARNING!~\n                             *!AIR START!*\n\n\nPeriodic stretches of driving rain, low clouds, and fog banks have made the Salween gorge even less of a popular area to conduct patrols as of recently. \n\nThe Japanese, however, have found the Salween gorge to be no more hospitable. Pressure by the AVG has halted much of their advance towards Yunnan Province. Their traffic through the area of the gorge has become a slow painful battle of attrition that depletes their resources without even allowing them a chance to engage the enemy unless he chooses to show himself- just like the raid earlier today did.\n\nThree hours ago, a large fighter sweep by the AVG preceeded a dive bombing attack on bases and troop concentrations in the area of the gorge. Several places in the gorge itself were attacked and reported as destroyed, including the airfield at the heart of the gorge, as well as ground targets. Vital bridges crossing the valley floor were also targeted during the attack.\n\nSeveral enemy aircraft were able to scramble but were shot down. One of them was flamed by Jim Howard of the 2nd Squadron, with the last few rounds in his guns.\n\nHe reported that his target went down near the center of the gorge, crashing into the trees on the West side of the river, and starting a forest fire. After flying over the crash site, he was brought under fire from several hidden anti-aircraft batteries, but managed to escape. As he maneuvered wildly to avoid ground fire, he spotted a large concentration of Japanese troops, trucks, and tanks near what looked like a fuel depot. His estimation is that this depot was just North of the spot at which his latest victory went down, but on the other side of the river, in a village.\n\nYour patrol has the task of verifying the presence of an un-damaged fuel dump in the area, and, if possible, destroying it and/or the vehicles it services. \n\nThis could turn into a key moment in the war- a setback the Japanese never dreamed of, a victory the Allies long for, and it is one that the AVG is fully capable of achieving. If only Chinese forces can destroy one of the last two bridges crossing the Salween in the Gorge, between the loss of this fuel dump and the loss of easy entrance to China on the North end of the Gorge this would halt the Japanese advance in it's tracks\n\nThe weather, as usual at this time of year, is turning poor. Hazy general conditions and low clouds almost from ground level to 3500 feet make for poor visiblity. Reports from the attack earlier have said all enemy aircraft were surprised and destroyed on the ground- but you have heard all that before, and reports prove little, sometimes.\n\nThis time your patrol is approaching the target area from the South, at around 3300 feet, and proceeding North up the gorge. The forest fire that was reported to have been caused by the crashed P-40 should be easy to spot, and from that landmark, location of the fuel dump should be child's play. The catch is- the Japanese will be as mad as a hornet's nest knocked from a tree. Expect a warm reception. The fuel dump, if present, may make quite an explosion, so be careful about how close you are to any fuel tanks when you pull the trigger.\n\nThe gorge should be slipping into view any moment now...\n\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n
