Short Put down your teddy bear and get up in the air!  We are under attack!\n\n
Description January 1st, 1942\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n0416 hours\n\n\nAIR RAID! \n\nThere's the sound of aircraft engines overhead, but  we are expecting no air traffic this early in the morning! Get in a plane and get airborne! We have only two planes fueled now, so that will have to do. Conditions are not good and visibility is poor. No intelligence about type or number of attackers is available, but it sounds like single engine aircraft. Shoot one down, and then we'll go look at it. I guess that our Christmas Day action against the Japanese has really put a thorn in their sides.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
