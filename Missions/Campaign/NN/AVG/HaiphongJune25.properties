Description June 25th, 1942\nIndoChina coast, east of HaiPhong harbor\n1600 hours\n\nAfter weeks of planning, a combined Chinese Air Force and AVG mission to IndoChina has been scheduled. The mission: to use Chinese SB 2M bombers to strike Japanese shipping in one of their biggest seaports, the harbor at HaiPhong, IndoChina\n\nThe key to this mission is the escort. Without fighter protection, the CAF bombers would never return from the mission. As it is, a bold plan is the only way to make the idea succeed.\n\nThree AVG P-40Es, led by Shark Red One, will fly to Mengtze and refuel, then rendezvous with the CAF attack aircraft and fly out over the Gulf of Tonkin. They will follow the coast to HaiPhong, conduct the raid, and then turn back North, to return to Mengtze. Each bomber carries enough fuel for the long trip, but the P-40s, even with belly tanks, do not.\n\nTherefore, the P-40s will land nearly 70 miles on the wrong side of the Chinese border, re-fuel in a cleared field next to the jungle, and then proceed North. Volunteers from the RAF landed a Dakota there last night to prepare the field. Sympathetic natives, tired of the Japanese yoke, have helped prepare markers leading to the secluded landing field. Today at 1500 hours, they will uncover their hidden markers and make ready for your arrival. The field may be rough, but it should be good enough for this one mission. The locals are taking a huge risk to help us.\n\nThe only problem so far, as you study your map and wonder how to find and then touch down on an airfield the Japs don't know about in their own backyard, is that the CAF bombers haven't come into sight yet, and they should have been in view ten minutes ago. Maybe they caught a tailwind. You sure hope so, as all you can do is follow your planned route and hope for the best. The things you volunteer for...landing will be the least of your troubles. At least they gave you directions before you took off at Mengtze:\n\n "Follow the bombers to the North after the raid, along the path marked on your map. You'll fly over a large jungle. When you reach the last river on your route that skirts that jungle, fly East along that river. You can't miss it, I'll mark your right turn on the chart. As you fly East, look along the riverbanks for markers pointing you to the airfield. Piece of cake. They'll have bedsheets or something out there to show you where to land. Just land between their markers, and the ground crew there will push your planes into the brush and re-fuel them".\n\nSure. Piece of cake.\n\nIntelligence reports indicate the harbor could be home to several warships, which you certainly don't want to tangle with! The reports also identify a seaplane base to the West of the harbor, and an Army airfield to the South. At least the weather here is fair, and visibility good.\n\n**Player should select '000Player' as skin**\n
