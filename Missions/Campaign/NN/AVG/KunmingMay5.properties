Short Defend Kunming from aerial bombardment. \n\n
Description May 5th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n0656 hours\n\nThere is an inbound raid coming from the Southwest this morning. At least three dozen Japanese medium bombers have been sighted headed straight for Kunming, and are to our Southwest. No escort has been reported- yet. They should be here in less than half an hour.\n\nFirst and 3rd Squadrons: send a total of three flights of four aircraft to intercept. The 1st will supply two flights, 3rd will supply the lead-off flight. Second Squadron: stand down until your scheduled missions at 0850.\n\nThe enemy is flying high this morning, so make your intercept at 10000 feet or even higher, and remember to check your oxygen hoses, masks, and regulators for leaks. Refer to your map for co-ordinates of the interception. The recon marker is where we estimate you'll make contact. If you don't see the enemy when you arrive there, loiter in the area and await instruction. My guess is you won't have to wait long.\n\nWeather today is fine and clear; ceiling and visiblity unlimited.\n\nAre there any questions? Good, let's get you out to the flight line.\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n
