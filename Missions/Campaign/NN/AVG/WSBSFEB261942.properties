Name wakeup!
Short Protect supplies from IJA\n
Description February 26, 1942\nRangoon, Burma\n1140 hours\n\nOK, let's make this quick! 3rd Squadron has intercepted a raid on Rangoon, but a dozen or so bombers made it through the fight. 3rd Squadron is returning to base to refuel and re-arm. 1st and 2nd Squadron have been vectored to make their own intercept, about 50 miles to the East of here.\n\nThey can take care of the bombers, but RAF radar has also picked up a contact heading up the coast from Moulmein- which can only mean one thing- the Japanese have launched a seperate group of planes, and they are headed straight up the coast for Rangoon. This seems like the start of a strafing raid calculated to take place right before the bombers arrive.\n\nAs our only fighter cover, we are relying on you to protect the two C-47s that are due to take off for Mingaladon in about ten minutes\n\nTake off immediately and follow the flight path shown on your map, to make a patrol around this base. Clouds are low and the weather is poor, keep a sharp look-out for low flying enemy planes.\n\nAfter your patrol, land immediately to re-fuel. Don't worry about escorting the C-47s all the way to Mingaladon, the 1st and 2nd Squadron planes returning there can handle that.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n
