Name Early AM recon intercept
Short Magwe\n\n
Description April 24th 1942\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n0540 hours\n\nWe have reports of a small single engined plane flying low down the river, about 50 miles or so North of here\n\nSince you're the Alert Plane pilot this morning, you'll have to check it out. I'll tell you right now, we have no planes scheduled to come in until almost noontime today, so expect it to be a Japanese plane, OK? Check your map, and I'll walk you out to the flightline. See the recon marker? That's where the plane should be in 5 or ten minutes\n\nSo- have you heard the latest? They say that the US Army bombed Tokyo! I heard it was that racing pilot, Jimmy Doolittle and a squadron of B-25s that did it. No joke, I heard it from Chennault's yeoman, that guy who got attacked in Rangoon, Trumble. He says nobody knows how they got there, but being a Navy man, he thinks it was from an aircraft carrier. I don't know, from a carrier? Bombers are pretty big. Roosevelt says they flew from Shangri-La!\n\nAlright here we are. Good luck and see you when you get back. Lousy weather this morning, be careful.\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as skin**\n\n\n\n
