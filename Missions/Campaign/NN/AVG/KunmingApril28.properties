Name First Kunming
Short First action from Kunming\n\n\n
Description April 28th, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n0641 hours\n\nThird Squadron: Welcome to Kunming. We're glad to have you. For those who have forgotten my name, it's still Chennault.\n\nMany of you are wondering about our situation here, what we are doing, and why it took so long to get you men here. For those of you who haven't heard it from 1st and 2nd Squadrons, I'll supply all the answers I can.\n\nKunming and it's environs are often the target of Japanese attack. From the city proper just to the North of this airbase to the more industrial regions on the shores of Lake Dianchi, there's always a target for the Japanese to pick. We of course oppose these raids strongly with fighter screens.\n\nFrom this airbase we are not just a Defensive force. We have launched raids against Japanese bases at Hanoi and Haiphong, located in IndoChina. We have begun a series of attacks against Japanese troop movements in Burma by the Salween river, where the Japanese are attempting to make a thrust into China. And we are winning these engagements.\n\n3rd Squadron's record thus far shows that it is perfectly suited to joining in this part of our Campaign with the other Squadrons. The 3rd is as well versed in strafing attacks, bomber interception, and fighter sweeps as any other in our Group. Third Pursuit Squadron pilots will also be pleased to learn we have here at Kunming a fair number of P-40E fighters, and you'll all get the chance to check out on them and take them into combat. A word of caution however- these are powerful aircraft. We lost a flight instructor in one just the other day. John Blackburn was practicing dive-bombing over the lake when he went in. So don't assume you know it all just yet. Understood?\n\nOne aspect of the air war here that those in the 3rd haven't seen yet is our bombing raids. Fortunately we have been getting replacement planes- the P-40Es I've mentioned, and all are fully capable of carrying bombs, and each is armed with six fifty caliber machine guns. We've used these to good effect. Now that all three units are here together in force, we can escort our fighter-bombers all the way to the Salween and back.\n\nAnother mission we undertake here is the Cargo Escort. Our re-supply is solely from the air, and occasionally Japanese fighters make long-range intercepts. Escorting these cargo flights when they come is is a high priority.\n\nWe also man some satellite airfields when necessary, such as Paoshan and Kweilin, to deny the Japanese a safe avenue to and from their targets in China that are away from this airbase.\n\nFinally, with the IndoChina border only one hundred fifty kilometers away, we undertake recon patrols along the front line marker you see on the map, to the Southwest.\n\nThe 3rd Squadron's actions over Central Burma were key in delaying Japanese advancement after our British friends lost the Battle of the Sittang. Every day you flew a mission, every truck and every bomber you shot at, every soldier manning an AA gun and every pilot taking off before dawn to attack your bases, was a man Japan couldn't use someplace else in their attempts to take over China. You took the edge off of a lot of attacks the Japanese could have made successful if you hadn't been there causing them problems. I know it must not have felt like it while it was happening, but without your actions in Burma, we wouldn't be here right now. Think about that a minute.\n\nNow we're fully open for business.\n\nThis morning's first mission is one you know all too well: Bomber interception. Have a look at the Operations Map.\n\nJapanese medium bombers are headed this way, and we have been tracking them with our warning net since 0500. Now it's clear that their target is Kunming.\n\nThird Squadron's  intercept point is marked on the chart, South of the lake- Recon this area for Japanese bombers by 0700 hours. They will be headed North, and you'll see them just about the time you arrive at the I.P., is my estimate. Ground observers reckon that their height is about 8500 feet, so you'll be making your intercept at 10,000.\n\nThe weather boys say that clear conditions will persist today. Some scattered high clouds may roll in, but not as low as your altitude.\n\nThe exact target of this raid isn't obvious. Based on the direction they are approaching from, it could be almost anywhere in the city proper, or even this airbase. They've tried before.\n\nFirst Squadron will patrol to the Southeast with two flights of four aircraft, near the Thai border, by 0915 this morning. Second Squadron will patrol the region of Lashio and conduct a fighter sweep by 0830, in preparation for a planned bombing attack by elements of 1st Sqaudron at 0845.\n\nOn your return to base, remember that this airstrip is at an elevation of 300 feet.\n\nQuestions?\n\nThird Squadron, you're on the flightline. This will be a four-ship interception. Flight Leader will be Shark Red One. Good luck.\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as skin**\n\n\n\n\n\n
