Name Curtain Call
Short The AVG's final mission- escort USAAF B-25s\n\n
Description July 3rd, 1942\nKunming, Yunnan Province, China\n1701 hours\n\nPlease take your seats\n\nThis is the last time I will be briefing you as Commander of the Flying Tigers. As of Midnight tonight, the AVG ceases to exist. Once your contracts are up, you will be provided transport home or, as some of you have already done, you may elect to stay on for a short but unspecified duration until the USAAF gets it's operation up to speed. US Army commissions are available to those that want them. Your parent Services will of course welcome you back on terms you have worked out before your resignations. \n\nThe decision is yours- you are not obligated to me to continue on here. You have fulfilled any personal obligation to a point of satisfaction I have never felt before, and will not feel again. I am proud to have been your Commander, and proud to have served with you. You have lived up to the promises I made concerning this outfit-  that the American Volunteer Group would become the finest Air Corps that History has ever seen.\n\nOne final mission is planned. Since it's arrival on June 22nd, the US Army has been planning how to best use it's medium bombers in this area of operations. Just yesterday, a reconnaissance flight located an advance Japanese airstrip just over the Burmese border. Bombers and fighters are operating out of it. The target for the first B-25 bombing mission has been chosen. They plan on obliterating that forward airstrip this afternoon.\n\nPlease turn your attention to the map.\n\nYou will take off at 1709 hours, and escort a group of eight USAAF B-25s over this Japanese airbase, and back home. Your route is indicated on the chart. Protection of the bombers is paramount. The 11th Bombing Squadron expects all it's planes back today, and we aim to deliver.\n\nThird Squadron will provide the escort. Four ships will take the strike aircraft to the target and back; flight leader will be Shark Red One. His flight will circle the airfield once, allow the bombers to formate, and then provide close escort. The B-25s will be flying at an altitude of 10,000 feet. \n\nWeather conditions have improved today and the rain has given way to partial sunshine and a misty haze. Clouds persist at 7,500 to 10,000 feet but are scattered. Walt Jourdan over at Meteorology tells me that the rain from this morning is not expected to return.\n\nOver the target, expect a healthy dose of AAA. The airbase is still under construction, but is fully operational, and that includes it's defenses.\n\nEnemy fighters will probably scramble. Be ready for them. Remember that your primary goal is protection of the bombers, not sweeping the area of fighters or risking your lives for one more kill. If necessary, draw the enemy up and away from the location of the airbase to escape their anti-aircraft fire. Lure the enemy up to your height, and dive down on him. Don't abandon the bombers.\n\nYou'll be coming home well before dark, unless you hike it. Are there any questions?\n\nThank you gentlemen, that is all. Thank you for for your service and sacrifice in the Flying Tigers, and Good Luck. I expect to see you all back for the farewell dinner tonight.\n\n**Player should select "000PlayerDisney" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n\n\n
