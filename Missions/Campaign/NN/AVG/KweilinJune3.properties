Short This template simulates the area around Kweilin, in Kwangsi Province China, around 1942\n
Description June 3rd 1942\nKweilin, Kwangsi Province, China\n0540 hours\n\nAlright, gather around. We have a confirmed force of sixteen Japanese medium bombers headed this way. They might bomb this base, they might bomb the town. Either way, we need to go up and get 'em.\n\nHere's the map, take a look. They are approaching from the North, about 8500 feet or so. The Recon marker shows where you will likely spot the enemy. No escort has been spotted. The weather this morning is hazy with clouds around 3300 feet.\n\nIt's a little unusual for this type of attack, but maybe the Old Man is right again, and the Japs are stepping up their attacks all over. Well, there's only one thing for it.\n\nShark Red One, you're on the flight line, this one's yours. Good luck.\n\n**Player should select '000Player' as skin**\n
