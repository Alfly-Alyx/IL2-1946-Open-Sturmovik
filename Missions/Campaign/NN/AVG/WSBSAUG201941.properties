Short Welcome to Burma. Fly a local orientation flight around the area of Rangoon, from RAF base Keydaw, in Toungoo\n
Description August 20th, 1941\nKeydaw Aerodrome, Burma\n0610 hours\n\nWelcome to RAF Aerodrome Keydaw. My name is Chennault, and I'm in charge of this operation. Take your seats.\n\nAs members of the first AVG contingent of pilots, this is where your operational training for your duties at CAMCO will begin. Specifically, you are contracted to the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company to manufacture, repair, and operate aircraft at up to $750 per month, depending upon rank. We'll worry about the operational part of your duties for now. Travelling expenses, paid leave, quarters and medical services-for treatment of conditions suffered in the line of duty or otherwise not associated with misconduct-are also provided. You'll have a 30 dollar per month alottment for rations as well. The rumors of a bonus for destruction of enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat are true; $500 per confirmed victory.\n\nHere at Toungoo, you will undertake the following regimen:\nSeventy two hours in lectures covering aerial tactics, both ours and Japanese, Japanese pilot training and technical manuals, Asian geography, Warning Net operation, and more, including maintenance of airframes, engines, and weaponry.\n\nSixty hours of specialised flying, in which you will learn favored tactics of friendly forces, including RAF tactics, and those of the Japanese, out of the classroom environment. We will also cover emergency procedures for our aircraft as well as more basic instruction as a refresher to our USAAC personel, and as introductory training for our Naval and Marine pilots, as our planes will be unfamiliar to non-Army pilots. Gunnery will be key. Those of you who've been piloting patrol planes and twin engined light bombers, pay close attention! You're going to have to get the hang of this right  quick.\n\nAfter training here, you will move to your initial combat postings. Third Squadron will stay here in the Rangoon area, First and Second will ferry aircraft to their post in Kunming, in Yunnan Province, China, where my Headquarters is located. \n\nI'll introduce you to your Squadron Leaders: 1st Squadron- Robert Sandell, 2nd Squadron, 'Scarsdale Jack' Newkirk, and this here is Arvid Olson, he's leading 3rd Squadron. You boys will be taking your orders from them, so give them your undivided attention during pilot meetings and consider them your Commanding Officers when in flight. Now, back to business.\n\nA word about your legal status here. You are not officially belligerents in this war. Chinese and Burmese officials and common people don't care about that, they need all the help they can get and are glad to have you here. The Japanese are another story. If they capture you, you will most likely be treated as a criminal under martial law, which means a probable execution after a mock trial. Do not become a Japanese prisoner, is my advice. Let that suffice.\n\nOur combat aircraft is essentially the Army's P-40B: the Curtiss Hawk 81A-2. We'll be teaching you how to fly these machines in a manner which WILL defeat the Japanese in the air. Make no mistake. Military specialists and experts back home predict our failure in three months. I intend to make this the most respected unit in flying history during that time. Let's get to know this aircraft better.\n\nThe H81A-2 is the export variant of the P-40B, these planes here were intended for the Brits. The RAF fellows call it a Tomahawk. This aircraft has superior roll and very good dive traits. Zoom climb is good, sustained climb from level flight is not. Elevator and rudder authority is more than acceptable. You will have four .30 caliber machine guns; two in each wing, and a pair of heavy machine guns at .50 caliber on the nose. Speed-wise, this aircraft should be faster than any Japanese plane you see, in level flight.\n\nGround handling is not easy. We are working on some jury-rig solutions, but we can't overcome inherent problems with ground handling. Namely, the short fuselage makes for a bumpy take-off roll and landing. On take-off, plenty of rudder may be needed, and you will want to 'fly the tail' as quicky as possible. That means: forward pressure on the stick is recommended before you even begin to roll. Be careful, however, ground looping this aircraft is not hard to do. On landing, you will also want to keep the tail up for as long as you can. Brakes and forward stick pressure help. The ship might 'waddle' during your landing roll, and you'll probably all dip a wingtip now and again. If you need to make an emergency landing in the feild rather than at an airbase, it's strongly suggested you perform a belly landing rather than a wheels-down attempt, as the crate is likely to flip over on it's nose.\n\nLet's get one of you aboard for a hop to get your feet wet. Who is first on the flight line? No-one? OK, then, who is assigned to this closest aircraft? You've flown fighters in the Marines, right? Great, step right up and hop on in, you're going to fly in a two ship formation with Olson on your wing. He'll show you how to get the engine going and give you Prestone temp redlines and so forth. Head to Rangoon and then North, come back on the route shown, and land here again.  I'll chart the course on your map. Local elevation is about 400 feet, and the mountains are nearly a mile high. You'll want to stay above 5,000 feet whenever possible- that goes for ALL you pilots. RAF and CAMCO aircraft may be in the area, so stay alert. If you get lost, don't forget that the control tower here has a radio.\n\nThat's that, let's get the show on the road.\n\n**note:\nSeveral pilot skins are included. Player may wish to select the "000Player" pilot skin to represent his or her pilot**\n\n\n\n\n
