Name Patrol 1
Short Dec 24 1941\n
Description December 24th, 1941\nMingaladon, AVG airbase, Burma\n0545 hours\n\nGood morning. After our poor air-raid warning yesterday, we're putting standing patrols out in case of Japanese attack. You four will be our eyes and ears. You'll be flying a route we are calling patrol Route One: due south to Rangoon, and then north near where some Japanese recon planes were spotted late yesterday, and then to the east. Check your maps. HQ in China sends it's congratulations on our actions yesterday, and we have begun to get some help, in the form of planes and pilots from 1st and 2nd Squadron, they've been coming in all week.\n\nI also have some bad news this morning. Lacy Mangleburg was killed yesterday, when his CW-21 ran out of fuel and crashed into a hillside. The other two ferry pilots, Shilling and Merritt, were hurt when they had to ditch too. Bad weather en route. We also lost Neil Martin and Henry Gilbert in combat over Rangoon. We'll have a service for them later today, it will be announced before noontime.\n\nI'm not going to patronize you men;  you've all known this job was dangerous since the day you got your wings back in the States. These men died doing their duty. Don't forget that.\n\nNow that the shooting has started, we are all relying on each other to see this thing through. Chennault says we'll fight this thing to a finish and that's just what we'll do. Also- be aware that there's a problem down in Rangoon. One of the ships that's been in dock a few days, the USS Tulsa, is basically interned in port. The ship and it's goods are impounded, because the Chinese say that the cargo is theirs, and the Brits say it belongs to them. It's all lend-lease stuff- trucks, jeeps, blankets, that sort of thing. It's such a big deal that Chiang Kai-shek's cousin, a General Yu Feipeng, has become his representative in town and is trying to sort it out. It's a huge mess. The Chinese are saying that the ship should leave and take it's cargo with it, because it's some sort of ploy to cheat the Chinese government. It just won't do to have a family member of Chiang's get hurt or killed during an air-raid while he's here to help clear up a mess. Be extremely vigilant.\n\nAlright, any questions on your patrol route? Good. Remember that RAF patrols may be out too. Our British friends have warmed up to us a little bit now that we're all fighting together, but beware of mistaking them for the Japanese and don't allow them to mistake you for anyone else, either. That will wrap up the breifing this morning, get to it.\n\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n\n\n
