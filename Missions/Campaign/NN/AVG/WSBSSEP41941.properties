Name Mingaladon arrival
Short We are receiving our first combat posting: Mingladon airfield, north of Rangoon\n\n
Description September 24th, 1941\nKeydaw Aerodrome, Burma\n0930 hours\n\n\nToday we will occupy the field at Mingaladon, which we will share with the RAF; your route is on your map. Third Squadron will be posted here, First and Second have both already moved on to China to patrol the Burma Road and the area of Yunnan Province. Chennault's gone to his headquarters at a place called Kunming in Yunnan Province, although he has somehow gotten a small twin engined Caproni Ca 310 out of the Chinese government for his personal use, and he'll be shuttling back and forth when time allows. Speaking of the Chinese government, each one of you will be issued one of these "blood chits" for your flight jacket. Just sew it on the back, so it's easy to see. If you're forced down or if you have to bail out, this blood chit identifies you as an American ally, and promises a reward in gold for your safe return. These things could save your life.\n\nBack to business. Third Squadron will defend Rangoon and it's surrounding area by acting in concert with the RAF, to destroy Japanese bombers intent on raiding the area. Japan wants to crush Chinese resistance by bombing ports and supply routes in Burma, so our job is to make sure the ports and roads stay open so resistance can continue. The Burmese have been insulated from this war for the most part, but soon they will feel Japan exert her will on them. China's only lifeline now exists through Burma. \n\nYour job here will be a difficult one. British authorities frown on us even boresighting our guns, they feel firing our weapons is the next nearest thing to combat, and they want to buy as much time as possible before engaging the Japanese. They know a fight is coming as well as we do. The trouble is, they like to do things a little more strictly than we're used to. We can't even get RAF radio code clearance right now. Luckily the local RAF bases operate a crude radar that will help in alerting us to any air raids\n\nTo make matters worse, wear and tear on our aircraft is enormous. Although we may post over two dozen aircraft at Mingaladon, only 2/3rds are expected to be in service at any time. That means sixteen aircraft will have to shoulder the burden of helping the RAF when the time comes. At most sixteen pilots will go out at any given time, and be outnumbered at least three to one on a typical day by our estimates. We may at some times get the whole squadron airborne, but I expect that to be today, and the day that we leave here. The whole might of the Japanese Imperial Army's Air Corps will be thrown against you and your RAF counterparts when the Japanese make their move. This is no joke, there's really a war going on! The Germans have conquered everything all the way up to Leningrad already and the Japanese are going to try to do the same thing out here.\n\nThis is why we pay you so well.\n\nThings are quiet here now, but it will just be a matter of time before that changes. Rangoon is key and the Japanese must know this. Use the time before our struggle begins wisely. Remember: diving attacks. Do not turn with your adversary. High side attacks and diving runs against bombers. Never fly a straight course for more than ten seconds in a combat area. Low and slow means: run! Escape and gain altitude. Never let your eyes leave your target. Speed is life. Speed and altitude equals victory. Make him play our game. Never play his. Concentrate attacks on flight leaders whenever possible. When escorts are present, don't let them keep you from taking out bombers. Eliminate them quickly, or assign part of your flight to keep them under wraps.\n\n Don't forget why you are here, and bear in mind what we've been teaching here. The Japanese are not nearsighted fools, far from it. They are deadly enemies. They are smart, and they are experienced in air combat from years of fighting in China. \n\nAlso, remember that the Japanese aren't  the only dangers out here. We all know what happened to Maax Hammer in a monsoon only two days ago- the weather here doesn't care if you're a trained aeronautical engineer or not, it can kill. Maax was a fine pilot but bad weather here killed him- and it can kill you. I'm reminding you because the weather is bad today, really bad. Stay on your brakes until you're clear to take off and watch the cross-breeze on landing.\n\nEnough pep talk, let's get out to our planes.\n\n\n*!!Note to player!!*\nTaking off in these conditions may be difficult. Autopilot can be used. If taking off manually, pause game immediately! Get prepared to- \n\napply brakes, lock tailwheel, start engine, 0% throttle, 0% pitch, hold rudder opposite to the side the wind pushes plane. Apply small amount of throttle to help hold nose straight. If you are not flight leader, you may wish to wait untill all of your squad mates in front of you have taken off before starting engine!\n\n
