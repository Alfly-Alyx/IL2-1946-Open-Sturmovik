Short Defend river-borne traffic from attack\n\n
Description March 25th, 1942\nMagwe, AVG airbase, Burma\n1422 hours\n\nThere's some good news, boys: The US Army has activated a new Air Force, the 10th, and their mission is to aid China. The bad news is that they're still in Ohio right now. On the other hand, the remaining RAF fighter strength has finally arrived here after two weeks of hopping from one airstrip to another. Things are getting a bit crowded in the mess hall, but the extra fighters mean we can probably hit an airbase or two to the South without leaving Magwe undefended. That also means: continue to be extremely careful. You all know how we lost Jack Newkirk raiding Moulmein just the other day, while Bill McGarry was shot down and is presumed captured. There's no such thing as an 'easy' ground attack mission. "Tex" Hill has been selected to replace Newkirk as 2nd Squadron leader, by the way.\n\nThis afternoon we have a much different misson than ground strafing, however.\n\nRiverborne traffic is a slow but constant source of supply for us and the Chinese. From time to time, the Japanese catch a transport barge or two undefended, and we have reason to believe that a group of cargo laden riverboats to the West of here will come under Japanese aerial attack today before dark.\n\nIf you look to the map, you'll see the area where the transports will be in approximately one half hour, indicated by the 'defence ground' marker. In the past, escorted IJA bombers have harrassed river traffic near this area. With the recent Japanese advance, we feel they have scouts monitoring these waterways for any riverboats or barges. A number of transports together undoubtably makes a juicy target.\n\nTake off by 1430 hours, and fly to the 'defence ground' marker on the map. If you don't see any hostile aircraft, loiter in the area for fifteen minutes, and pay attention particularly to the North and South, because that's most likely the way the Japanese will approach- right along the river. If after that time no hostile aircraft are seen, radio back here and await instruction.\n\nBe aware that you're going to be near the front line of Japanese expansion here. If you have an emergency be sure to get back on the ground on the right side of the front. RAF recon photos indicate that while the Japanese haven't moved up to the front line markers in force yet, they do have small units at, or even North of, the illustrated front line.\n\nWeather this afternoon should be fair, but with low clouds obscuring otherwise fine visibility. \n\n\n**Player should select "000Player" as aircraft skin**\n\n
