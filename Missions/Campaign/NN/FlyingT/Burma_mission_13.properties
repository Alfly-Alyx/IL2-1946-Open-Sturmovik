Name Covering the Retreat from Tamu
Short Fly cover over our retreating columns\n
Description Time: 1735\nConditions: Broken clouds at 800, light winds\nCruise: 3000m @ 350\n\nFollowing the devastating raids against the blocking position on the Yu River, the decision to abandon the position and fall back toward Tamu was all but made for us. The rearguard troops have fallen back and the engineers have blown the second bridge, while other troops have set up another blocking position in the last chokepoint before Tamu.\n\nConvoys are moving supplies out of the Moreh Depot and carrying units back toward Imphal. It will take the Japanese some time to rebuild the two bridges over the Yu, so our ground troops have bought a little time to organize the withdrawal.\n\nThe Japanese air force is still very active, however. We need to protect the retreating convoys from air attack. Take your two-ship flight and relieve the CAP over the road from Tamu. Keep the Japanese off our retreating troops.\n
