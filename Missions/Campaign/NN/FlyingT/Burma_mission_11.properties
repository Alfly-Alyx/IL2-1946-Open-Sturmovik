Name Airfield Assault
Short Hit a Japanese forward airfield in a pre-dawn raid\n
Description Time: 0445\nConditions: Scattered clouds at 1300, light winds\nCruise: 500m @ 350\nTarget: 200m @ 400\n\nReports indicate that the Japanese have moved a fighter squadron - probably the 64th Sentai -  forward to the airstrip at Naukpaw. We are going to attack this base in an effort to destroy as many Japanese planes on the ground as we can. Because of Japanese numerical superiority in our area, our only chance to hit the base is before the first morning patrol gets airborne.\n\nThe plan is to go in low and avoid Japanese positions, in the hope of achieving surprise. Hit fast and get out before the Japanese can react.\n\nYou will lead the four-ship flight tasked with hitting the base. It is likely that the Japanese will launch fighters when you are detected, so your flight will be covered by another section of our fighters. Expect heavy flak over the target.\n\nTarget the flak positions first if possible, then knock out as many aircraft on the ground as possible.\n
