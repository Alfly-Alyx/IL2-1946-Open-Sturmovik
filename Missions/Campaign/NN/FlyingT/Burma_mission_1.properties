Short Fly a tactical reconnaisance over Japanese positions near Sittaung.\n
Description Time: 1200\nConditions: Clear, light winds\nCruise: 2500m @ 350\nTarget: 500m @ 400\n\nWelcome to India. We have been forced back beyond the Indian-Burmese frontier by the Japanese onslaught. The remnants of Burwing - 17 Squadron RAF (Hurricanes), 45 Squadron RAF (Blenheims), a detachment of 31 Squadron RAF (Dakotas), and us, the 3rd Squadron of the AVG - will be operating from the bases around Imphal. We are based at Sapam.\n\nWe are badly outnumbered by the Japanese, and cut off from easy resupply. The most important thing is to stay alive and keep our aircraft flying.\n\nYou will take your two-ship formation and fly a low-level recon over Japanese positions. They appear to be massing forces for a crossing of the Chindwin River near Sittaung. Overfly the likely crossing point at Tingy, then check out the village northwest of Sawkaw for evidence of a supply build-up. Hit any targets of opportunity you come across, but be careful - we need every aircraft serviceable.\n
