Name Dawn Patrol
Short Fly the first morning CAP over your airfield.\n
Description Time: 0545\nConditions: Scattered clouds at 1100m\nCruise: 3000m @ 350\n\nGood moring. Just a routine CAP over the airfield, although we've increased the flight to four aircraft in light of the recent air attacks against our airbases. Climb to 3000m and orbit the base for 30 minutes. Note that we are expecting several transports coming down from China with spare parts for your fighters. Unlike most transport flights, they will be landing at our field, not Palel.\n
