Name Paras at Sunrise
Short Escort RAF Dakotas carrying a company of Paras to Taungbala Ferry\n
Description Time: 0615\nConditions: Clear, light winds\nCruise: 2500m @ 350\n\nHitting the Yu River bridge slowed the Japanese push west, but they are still driving north. Chinese forces had to pull back from Lwin-u, with the Japanese right behind them. If they continue, they will reach Taungbala Ferry and have another crossing over the Chindwin. Worse, we have virtually no forces in that area, and we can't spare any from the defense of Tamu. The only thing to do is drop in a specially-trained demolition team to demolish the ferry and facilities before the Japanese get there.\n\nYou will lead your two-ship flight in an escort of the Dakota carrying the team. Friendly local tribesmen have set fires to mark the landing area west of the village.\n
