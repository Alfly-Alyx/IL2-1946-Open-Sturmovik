Name Battlefield CAP
Short Fly cover over the front lines\n
Description Time: 1400\nConditions: Scattered clouds at 1100, light winds\nCruise: 4000m @ 350\n\nA British Hurricane pilot just reported a massive Japanse bomber formation heading toward Tamu from the east-southeast, altitude approximately 3500m, heading 290. His flight was low on fuel and could not engage, but other Hurricanes have already been dispatched. We have shifted our only airborne fighters to intercept as well.\n\nYou will take off and lead your four-ship flight toward the bombers. Knock down as many as you can. There were no reports of fighter escort, so maybe our early-morning raid on the fighter base was more effective than we hoped.\n
