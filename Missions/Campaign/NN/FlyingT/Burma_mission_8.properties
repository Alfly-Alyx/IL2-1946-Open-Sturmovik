Name Bridge Busters
Short Escort RAF Blenheims headed for the Yu River bridge below Tamu\n
Description Time: 1810\nConditions: Broken clouds at 1000m\nCruise: 2500m @ 350\n\nIn spite of our best efforts, the Japanese have moved up and look to be preparing to cross the Yu River below Tamu. The defensive line there has held them so far, but it is very likely that they will attempt to sieze the bridge under the cover of darkness.\n\nWithout the bridge the Japanese advance will have to stop, giving our forces a chance to solidify the defensive line. The Royal Engineers had the bridge wired for demolition, but the charges failed to fire. The only option left is to bomb the bridge from the air.\n\nThe air battles of this afternoon have taken their toll. We have only a handful of serviceable aircraft available. RAF Hurricanes will fly a sweep to draw off the Japanese fighters, while you will take a four-ship flight and fly close escort for the Blenheims. The bombers must get through.\n
