Name Battlefield CAP
Short Fly cover over the front lines\n
Description Time: 1120\nConditions: Broken clouds at 900, moderate winds\nCruise: 3000m @ 350\n\nThe Japanese are moving up artillery and troops in preparation for another attempt at crossing the Yu River below Tamu. The front line there is under constant bombardment from artillery and aircraft. That line must be kept intact if we are to hold the Japanese there.\n\nSince our means for detecting incoming Japanese raids are limited (almost nonexistant at this point, since we have lost contact with most of our spotters since the Japanese advance), we are going to try setting up a multi-layered defense. Your flight will try to catch any incoming bombers before they get close to the front line, giving us more time to deal with them. This means splitting the CAP into separate elements, so be careful - you may be badly outnumbered until help can arrive.\n\nTake your two-ship flight and fly Barrier CAP east of the front lines. Japanese fighters are still plentiful in the area, so expect to see them as well as bombers. Engage the fighters if you must, but your primary objective is to keep the bombers away from the ground troops. Watch out for flak on the Japanese side of the river.\n
