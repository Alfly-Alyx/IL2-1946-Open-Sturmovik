Name Inclement Interdiction
Short Hit Japanese ground targets near Sittaung.\n
Description Time: 1420\nConditions: Overcast at 500m\nCruise: 2500m @ 350\nTarget: 500m @ 400\n\nThe Japanese are taking advantage of the bad weather that rolled in to solidify their hold on the west bank of the Chindwin south of Sittaung. They are attempting to get their forces across the river in strength, probably for a push toward Tamu and the Yu River.\n\nTake your two ship flight and see if you can slow them down. Climb over the clouds for you cruise to target - cloud tops are at 2500m. Enemy air cover is not expected due to the low clouds, but the Japanese are probably turning their bridgehead into a flak trap, so don't linger in the target area.\n\nBe advised - other friendly aircraft will be in the area.\n
