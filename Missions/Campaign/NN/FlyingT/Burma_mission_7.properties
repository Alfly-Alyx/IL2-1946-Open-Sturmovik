Short Stop the Japanese breakthrough toward Tamu\n
Description Time: 1305\nConditions: Broken clouds at 1300m\nCruise: 1500m @ 350\n\nThe Japanese have broken through the defensive line at Sittaung and are streaming forward toward the Kabaw Valley and Tamu. Defenses are prepared along the Yu River line, but the chances of our thinly-stretched ground forces holding them for very long are scant. We're going to throw everything we have against the Japanese forces moving west.\n\nLead your four-ship flight out and hit any enemy aircraft flying over the Sattaung-Tamu road east of the Yu River. British planes are up and are working over the Japanese ground troops. There are likely to be a lot of Japanese fighters covering their advance. Your primary mission is to protect the British attack aircraft. You may also hit targets of opportunity along the road, but keep the attack aircraft safe.\n
