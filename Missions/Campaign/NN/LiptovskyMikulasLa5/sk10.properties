Short Battle for Liptovsky-Mikulas\nVrbica\n
Description March 1945\n\nRussian and Czechoslovak soldiers managed to capture the heights but the Germans always counterattacked and regained the lost territory.  Each of the three hills changed hands many times over the course of several days of fighting.  Czechoslovak attacks were supported by 37mm AAA used like machine guns and "manned" by female crews.\n\nThe Russians also managed to enter the city but their position became desperate when the Germans regained control of the hills.  The strategy is clear:  he who holds the hills also controls Liptovsky Mikulas.\n\nThen German forces attacked the city from three sides.  A Hitler Youth Battalion attacked from the south across the Vah River while the other German forces north and west of the city were supported by tanks.\n\nTime:  0800  Weather:  Hazy\n\nMission:\nSturmoviks will attack the Germans at Liptovsky Mikulas.  Eight Lavochkins will escort the Sturmoviks.  Meet the IL-2s in the area of Hrabusice and escort them to the target.\n
