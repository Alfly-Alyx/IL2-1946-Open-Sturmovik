Just outside on the apron, the mechanics were warming up your Hurricanes, parked in rows on the flightline. "All right lads," he said, pulling the pipe from his mouth, "as some of you may know, RAF Command sent a flight of Wellingtons over Berlin last night as a payback for their bombing of London Saturday night. Well it doesn't look like it has deterred Jerry at all. Coastal radar has plotted a large bomber formation coming across the Channel and it's heading takes it right over London." He took a puff on his pipe and continued... "we have to stop these bloody bastards." He flipped through the pages of his clipboard. "We're flying almost everythng we have available tonight, many of our kites ar being serviced, including most of the Spits from 266 Squadron." \n\nHe tossed his clipboard on a nearby crate. "So we have to be as effective as we can with what we have. We're not looking for kills tonight, we want to hit them hard enough to turn them back, get them to drop their loads early... We want to try to go for the lead ships first." He puffed on his pipe again. "This will be our third flight today, you're probably all tired, I know I am, but..."\n\n"At's alright Sir," came a voice from the crowd of pilots, " I had a catnap last week, I'll be fine..."\n\nA wave of laughter rolled through the group.\n\nHess grinned widely, "good lads, lets go to work then. We'll join up over Southampton Harbor, form up on me."\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_BW_belly.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
