Short Thursday, August 29, 1940.  \n\nFighter-Bomber Intercept\n
Description DATE: Thursday, August 29, 1940.   11:00AM\n\nWEATHER: Partly cloudy with scatered rain.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: Wednesday, August 28,  Enemy air activity targeting airfields, harbors, factories & radar stations during the day and areas of London at night. An increased number of enemy fighters flying escort with the daylight raids for bomber protection.  Due to fuel consumption, enemy fighters cannot linger in combat areas.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nSOUTHAMPTON AREA, ON PATROL:\n\nThe Weymouth area had been plagued with enemy reconnaisance flights all morning and your flight was tasked with clearing the area of enemy flights. That done, the Portsmouth area was next on the list... Several reports of enemy flights had been reported in the area of Portsmouth Harbor and the nearby radar station.  It would probably be another wild-goose chase... But with about 60% of your fuel, your flight had plenty of air-time left.\n\nOver Southampton Bay, the radio crackled again with a call to your flight: "Mother Goose to Mama Bear... Mother Goose to Mama Bear..."\n\nYou hear your flight leader respond: "This is Mama Bear, go ahead Mother Goose."\n\n"Mama Bear, Westhampnett is under attack. Repeat, Westhampnett is under attack..!" \n\n"Understood Mother Goose, Mama Bear in-route." After calling a new heading, your flight did an abrupt about-face and made a bee-line for RAF Westhampnett. \n\n"Lets' go lads, Tally Ho!"\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_A.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
