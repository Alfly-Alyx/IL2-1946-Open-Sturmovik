Name Battle of Britain - Spit N Fire_03
Short \n
Description DATE: Sunday, September 8, 1940.   10:00AM\n\nWEATHER: Fair in the moring and cloudy later in the day.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Biggin Hill\n\nSITUATION: Friday, September 6, enemy air activity was lighter with 3 main raids all largely broken up before reaching their targets. Night brought generally harassing raids with little damage. Saturday, September 7, The Luftwaffe had changed tactics again, switching their daytime bombing targets from the RAFs battered and exhausted airbases, to London. This raid numbered approximately 350 enemy planes, the heaviest attack ever seen, catching the RAF by suprise. Night raids on London continue from dusk till dawn. Main objectives were the East End and Docks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIN ROUTE TO RAF LYMPNE:\n\n"Right Lads, up we go..." You looked left and right out of your canopy as 79 formed up and began climbing up through the clouds. A transport plane passed beneath your flight, lining up to land at the 'Hill'.  \n\nWell, at least the service blokes got a little paint on your kite to cover all those bare repairs - it didn't look so much like a bad quilt anymore. \n\nAs your flight passed through Angels 3, the radio crackled, "Mother Goose to Fox Leader, Mother Goose to Fox Leader..."\n\n"Fox Leader," you replied, "go ahead, Mother Goose..."\n\n"Fox Leader, climb to Angels 9. We have an enemy flight inbound, 20+, approximately Angels 8. Enemy flight is predicted to enter West of Dover, maintain your current flight plan to intercept... Spitfires from 66 out of Gravesend are also being routed to your area."\n\nYou keyed your mike, "understood Mother Goose." You took a quick glance at your watch and sighed, the Jerrys are starting early today, you thought. You knew full well the early morning raids sometimes simply did not materialize and would end up in a game of hide-and-go-seek. Bloody hell, you hated that game.\n\nYou switched your radio over to the squadron frequency. "Right Lads, remember, we just want to encourage the Jerrys to pack it in and go home - let 'em run out of petrol over the pond... keep our folks on the ground from having to clean up the mess..."\n\n**Use "BigginHill79" skin.**\n\n\n
