"You pick the kites?"\n\n"Yep..." you handed him a slip of paper without looking up, "serial numbers are on here, they both could use to be retired... '473' hasn't been right for weeks."\n\nDenny nodded, "I know, I've flown her, she's coming apart at the seams."  He leaned back and streched, looking over at your paper, "is that about that factory near Gravesend...?"\n\n"Yeah, says here it was an ammunition plant..."\n\nDenny nodded, "right, that would explain that fireworks show we saw..." \n\nPilots from one of the other squadrons strolled by, saluting as they passed. You saluted casually back before returning to the conversation. "Did you see the Jerry who hit it? The shock wave took his wings right off... I don't think they knew what they were hitting..."\n \nDenny chuckled, "If they did, they wouldn't have gone in so low..." He grinned,  "serves them right, bastards got what they deserved."\n\nYou looked up from the paper, "Lauren and I are going to the Boar & Thistle for dinner tonight, can you get a date?"\n\n"Sure, I'll call Nellie..."\n\n"The little blond from Administration?"\n\nDenny nodded, "that's the one..."\n\n"She's a doll."\n\nDenny jumped out of the Jeep, "lemme go call her," he tapped his shirt pocket containing the serial numbers, "I'll call this in while I'm at it..." he disappeared around the corner into the hangar and you went back to your paper.\n\nTwo trucks full of Commandos trundled past. You exchanged waves with the men in the red berets, their faces smeared with camouflage paint. It was about five minutes before Denny reappeared. "Done," he grinned, "we'll have the new kites this week."\n\nYou grinned, "Bloody marvelous! And dinner...?"\n\n"We're on..." he replied, wiggling his eyebrows up and down.\n\nThe loudspeakers on the buildings around the flight line crackled: "ATTENTION - 312 Squadron...  ATTENTION - 312 Squadron...  SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE!"\n\nYou tossed the paper to the seat of the Jeep as you jumped up, "time to go to work..."\n\n**NOTE : Remember to release chocks**\n\n**Use "RYFnm.bmp" with marking skin.**\n\n\n
