Description DATE: Sunday, July 14, 1940 - 11AM\n\nWEATHER: Fair.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: July 12 - July 14...Two convoys attacked off Harwich. Two raids on Dover driven off by RAF fighters, poor weather generally restricted operations.  Shipping convoy near Dover damaged. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, BRIEFNIG ROOM:\n\n"Good morning lads, have a seat..."   Sir Hess motioned to the chairs in the room and he sat casually on the corner of his desk with a cup of hot tea in one hand and his clipboard in the other hand, laying across his leg.\n\n"You'll be happy to know a case of Irish arrived on one one of our supply trucks  today, courtesy of that convoy Commander we covered on Wednesday. They had a few bits of damage but everyone made it to port. Needless to say, he was quite pleased." \n\n"Home defense has been deploying barrage balloons in some of the populated areas and manufacturing districts, so watch yourself when your flying around those locations, don't get yourself caught up in those cables."\n\n"We lost a couple of kites Thursday night when we intercepted that flight of Heinkles over the Isle of Wight, but for the most part, we gave those Jerries a right good bashing. Their target was the manufacturing district of Isle Wight and they managed to inflict some damage, but they paid dearly for it."\n\n"RAF Command announced this morning that we will shoot down Jerry planes with red crosses on them... the damn Huns have used aircraft marked as medical flights for reconaissance aircraft - a major bit of treachery, totally despicable. We won't stand for it." \n\n"You chaps're going to be flying 2-element patrols over the channel... shoot down anythng you come across in the way of observation craft, but do not engage flights of superior number. Call for assistance and report all aircraft movements to control, do not jeopardize your kites. And be watchful for escort fighters, don't get caught napping lads, or it'll be your arse."\n\n"Dismissed and good hunting."\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_B.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
