Short \n
Description DATE: Tuesday, September 10, 1940.   6:00PM\n\nWEATHER: Generally cloudy with light scattered rain.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Lympne - Day Field.\n\nSITUATION: Sunday, September 8, Enemy air activity was light during the daytime, with minor attacks on scattered airfields. Night brought heavy attacks on London, mainly in the east. Monday, September 9, Thunder showers contributed to unsuccessful attempts to attack London, the Thames area and several aircraft factories.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF LYMPNE : DEPARTING FOR BIGGIN HILL\n\nPretty much everything that was easily moved, got packed on the transports or onto the trucks that went into town for the night. Anything that stayed at Lympne was draped in camoflage netting and made as invisible as possible. This was a daily exercise.\n\nYou checked your watch. "Ok Lads," you shouted, as you trotted across the wet grass towards your Hurricane, "let's head home!"  You climbed up onto your wing and looked around as you stepped into your cockpit, making sure nothing was forgotten. "Remember Lads," you shouted, "stay with the transport kites!" \n\nThe scattered rain had curtailed enemy air activity today and except for a few small nuisance raids on airstrips, little action was seen in your area.  RAF Control had reported more scattered rain between Lympne and the Hill so you thought it a good idea to leave Lympne a little earlier than normal.\n\nAs you made your way through your pre-flight checklist, you contacted RAF Control... "Fox Leader to Mother Goose, Fox Leader to Mother Goose..."\n\nA female voice responded, "Mother Goose here, go ahead Fox Leader."\n\n"Fox  Flight preparing to depart Lympne with 'extras', for the Hill."\n\n"Understood Fox Leader, you are cleared for departure for Biggin Hill. Be advised, we have reports of small enemy flights retreating from the London area, none of these flights are currently on radar."\n\n"Right Mother Goose, we'll let you know if we see anything..."\n\n**Use "BigginHill79" skin.**\n\n
