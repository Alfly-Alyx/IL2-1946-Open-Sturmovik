Description DATE: Tuesday, September 24, 1940.   8:30AM\n\nWEATHER:Hazy with fog. Expected to clear midday and be partly cloudy with a light chance of scattered rain.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Biggin Hill.\n\nSITUATION: Sunday, September 22, Foggy and rainy, activity was greatly reduced and no major daytime attacks were recorded. Monday, September 23, Two separate, major attacks were intercepted, both over the East Kent area. One at 9:30, one at 17:30, but both attacks were broken up and  the London area was not penetrated. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF BIGGIN HILL: SCRAMBLE!\n\n312 was still short on planes, several of them having been rotated to the service area for considerable work.  The upside was, the ones you were now flying were in as good a shape as you could hope to fly, short of getting a new one. In fact, a few new ones had come to the Hill, but try as you might, you could not seem to finesse one into your squadron.\n\nThe fog was starting to lift and it looked like visibilty was going to be pretty fair. You were doing a thorough walk-around on your kite when Denny walked up. \n\n"Skipper..."\n\n" Denny..."\n\n"They did a nice job..."\n\n"Yes they did," you replied, running your hand over the surface of the newly replaced engine cowling.\n\nDenny cleared his throat nervously... "want a new one...? His voice was nearly a whisper.\n\nYou froze, your hand in mid stroke on the side of the cowling... "NEW, new...?" You asked, not turning around.\n\n"Aye... NEW, new... two of them..."\n\nThat spun you around. "TWO!?"\n\n"SSSsshhh!" He came closer. "There's a bloke over in maintenance, let's just say he owes me..."\n\n"Gambling?"\n\nDenny touched his nose in a sly confirmational signal. "He owes me enough for a bungalow..."\n\n"You wonderful little bastard... " you grinned. But what about our other kites?"\n\n"You can pick out two of the old ones, he'll tie them up in service long enough to be overhauled and reassigned..."\n\nYou grinned like the Cheshire Cat... "do it."\n\n"Will do... Say did you hear anything about our bombers attacking targets in Berlin last night..?"\n\n"Yeah it's true, I couldn't get any details though. I don't think they know if it was successful or not yet..."\n\nYou conversation was interrupted by the loudspeakers on buildings around the flight line: "312 Squadron - SCRAMBLE! REPEAT, 312 Squadron - SCRAMBLE!"\n\nDenny disappeared as you ducked under the wing of your Spitfire, appearing on the other side and climbing up toward the cockpit. As you stepped into the cockpit you waved encouragement as your lads ran for their planes."Let's GO Lads! No dawdling!" \n\nAs soon as your engine fired up, the ground crew pulled your chocks and you began your roll to the runway. You switched on your radio, and contacted RAF Control - they confirmed an incoming raid that had been unseen by radar till well inland. Your best chance at interception was on the upper edge of grid I-14 near Gravesend at Angels 2.5.\n\n**NOTE : Remember to release chocks**\n\n**Use "RYFnm.bmp" with marking skin.**\n\n\n
