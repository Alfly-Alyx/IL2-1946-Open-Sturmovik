Name Battle of Britain - Hurricane Season_07
Short Tuesday, July 23, 1940.  \n\nDefend Channel minesweeper operations.\n
Description DATE: Tuesday, July 23, 1940 - 10:00AM\n\nWEATHER: Cloudy with scattered rain.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: July 20 - 22  Channel attacks continue, but weather has curtailed activity. Enemy mining of harbor and estuary entrances, as well as other areas has kept the Royal Navy busy with minesweeping duties.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, MAIN HANGAR:\n\nSir S/L Hess was standing in the hanger, surrounded by planes in various states of maintenance. He stood with his feet apart, his hands on his hips, his ever-present clipboard in his left hand. Once everyone gathered around he pulled his pipe out of his pocket and banged it loudly against the clipboard to clear it out. \n\n"Ok lads, it doesn't look like this weather will clear up, but at least the rain has stopped for a bit." \n\n"The bloody Jerrys have been playing about with those damn mines of theirs... The Navy has been working on mineclearing and they're concerned their minesweepers will become targets for bottling up the harbors, so they've asked for our help. Keep an eye out for Jerry bombers and recon planes - they're your main priority, we need to keep them out of the area we're assigned. We're covering from here down to Portsmouth."\n\n"I want you to get as much altitude as you can, but stay below the clouds for the best visibility on the Navy's equipment. 42 will be on standby in case you need support."\n\n"I know it's easy to get complacent up there Lads, but don't slack off, stay alert and bring those kites back in one piece..." He paused to pack some tobacco into his pipe, "dismissed Lads."\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_B.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
