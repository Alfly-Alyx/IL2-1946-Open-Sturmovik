Name Battle of Britain - Hurricane Season_13
Short Thursday, August 8, 1940.  \n\nIntercept.\n
Description DATE: Thursday, August 8, 1940.  - 5:00PM\n\nWEATHER: Mostly cloudy with scattered rain and ocassional bright areas.\n\nLOCATION: SW corner of grid  D-11, en-route to intercept enemy flight in grid G-10.\n\nSITUATION: After several days of reduced bombing activity but increased reconnaissance probes, Luftwaffe attacks have resumed with a marked increase in frequency and size of attacking flights.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nW OF TANGMERE, IN-ROUTE TO INTERCEPT:\n\nThis was the third intercept run for your flight today and no one could believe the size of the attacking Luftwaffe flights... they had easily doubled in size since last week. Of course the RAF flights had increased in size as well, but you always seemed to be outnumbered... And the confusion with 100 to 150 planes in a swirling fight was staggering... it was physically draining and mentally exhausting with no time to recharge. \n\nDuring your first flight, you watched Johnny's Hurricane go down into the Channel minus it's left wing, courtesy of a 109. His chute opened low but you heard during your refuel later, a PBY had picked him up after the action. He would be back tomorrow after spending a night in the base hospital. \n\nYou only had about 30 minutes between your previous flight and this one. The sandwich your Flight Sergeant handed you while the ground crews re-armed and re-fueled your Hurricane was enough to get your stomach to stop growling but not much more. You had been in your kite pretty much most of the day since about 9am and you were starting to get stiff... you released the canopy latch and slid it open a couple inches for fresh air, it seemed to help some and it felt refreshing. \n\nYour flight was observing radio silence and if it wasn't for the fresh air, the drone of the engine could make your mind wander. You looked around and realized there were several other members of your intercept group with their canopys open.\n\nYou checked and adjusted your harness, then checked your watch... about 3 minutes to intercept.\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_A.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
