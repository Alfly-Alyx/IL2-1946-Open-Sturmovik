Name Battle of Britain - Spit N Fire_21
Short \n
Description DATE: Friday, October 25, 1940.   11:30AM\n\nWEATHER: Overcast with no prediction of rain.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Detling\n\nSITUATION: Monday, October 21, through Thursday, October 24, lousy weather with rain, fog and constant cloud cover gave the RAF a short respite as enemy air activity dwindled to single plane reconaissance flights and random single plane raids, which were totally ineffective.\n\nNight attacks continue through the poor weather, on London, Coventry, Birmingham and Liverpool.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF DETLING : FLIGHT LINE\n\nAt about 9:00AM, enemy raids of single and twin-engine fighter-bombers crossed the coast at Dungeness and flew towards Maidstone and Biggin Hill. Splitting into five sections, they swept simultaneously over Biggin Hill, Kenley, South & Central London, then passed back over Maidstone on their exit.\n\nIt had been a busy morning chasing Jerrys quite literally all across the countryside. You and your Lads ended up over Detling with empty guns and out of petrol - the scattered Jerry flights heading for the Channel and home. \n\nThe Detling ground crews did a bang-up job of handling the extra traffic and did their best to get your Lads refueled and rearmed... however, at 11:00AM, RAF radar began tracking enemy formations gathering across the Channel before all your crates were ready... so you were forced to launch with whomever was ready. The rest would have to catch up when they could. \n\n"Mother Goose to Blue Swift Leader... Mother Goose to Blue Swift Leader..."\n\nYou adjusted your radio volume and keyed your mic, "Blue Swift Leader here, go ahead Mother Goose..." \n\n"Blue Swift Leader, take your flight to grid I-14 to intercept incoming enemy formation at Angels 9. Supporting flights are being directed to that location..."\n\n"Understood, Mother Goose," you replied. \n\n"Good Hunting Blue Swift Leader. Mother Goose, out..."\n\nYou looked left and right over your wings to check the Lads before sliding your canopy closed and latching it. Switching your radio channel, you keyed your mic, "Ok Lads, up we go, stay together now..." \n\nYou didn't have to ask Mother Goose what you'd be intercepting, you already knew - single and double engine fighter-bombers. Jerry had changed his tactics again, they'd been loosing too many big bombers in their daytime raids, so now they reserved the big boys for the nighttime. \n\nAnd quite honestly, the fighter-bombers were a pain in the arse, splitting up in little flights and hitting multiple targets all over the place... it made interception a tiring cat and mouse game.\n\nOn a positive note... at least you were the cat.\n\n**Use "RYFnm.bmp" with marking skin.**\n\n\n\n
