Description DATE: Monday, August 12, 1940.  - 3:00PM\n\nWEATHER: Mostly clear with light scattered clouds.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: August 11th, #74 Squadron intercepted a raid on the Dover barrage balloon defenses by Bf 110's and Bf 109's. Portland naval base was attacked by a flight of 150 German bombers - five Hurricane and two Spitfire squadrons were sent to intercept..  \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, MAIN APRON, READY AREA:\n\nS/L Hess had just come back from a flight and was in the process of removing his gear, his now-silent Hurricane sat a few feet away just outside the main door of the hangar. "Ok Lads," he began, scratching his head after removing his flight cap... "flight A and B you're going up on an intercept. Looks like Jerry is changing his tactics, were seeing an increase in the use of 110s for bombing and recon. Watch yourselves, they're fast and powerful and more maneuverable than you'd expect. The tower told me there's a flight inbound, looks like they may be heading for one of our radar sites down towards Westampnett. Do you have your coordinates?"\n\nYou nodded along with the rest of the pilots.\n\n"Good," he responded, taking the sandwich and tea handed him by one of his ground crew. "Get going..." He sat down on a crate and began quietly eating the sandwich without really looking at it.\n\nAs you walked out to your Hurricane, you took note of a row of holes in the fuselage of Hess's kite, and another rather large ragged hole in the left wing.  "109 nose cannon..." said Johnny, mirroring your thoughts as he walked along side you.\n\n"Mmm, yeah," you nodded. " I heard they intercepted a raid headed for Portsmouth."\n\n"Yeah, and I heard it got messy," Johnny commented. "We lost a couple." He hoisted himself up onto the wing of his Hurricane, "luck, mate..." Johnny had mellowed a bit since his swim in the Channel and you noted that you hadn't seen him with a cigarette since then either.\n\n"Luck," you waved. By the time you reached your own plane at the end of the row, several were already starting up, their exhausts popping as they turned over. \n\nLike a Pavlovian response, your heart quickened and you swallowed hard when you held in the starter button and heard the exhaust pop as your own engine rumbled to life.\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_A.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
