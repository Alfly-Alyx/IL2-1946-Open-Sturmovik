There would be little air activity today and the day bases were completely closed because the waterlogged grass airstrips would be tracherous to use.\n\nYou hiked the collar on your flight jacket and you adjusted your hat in preperation before stepping out the front door of the building. The smudged grey sky greeted you with swirling, slanted rain.  You ducked and hurried from the building's awning to the waiting car and jumped in as fast as you could, slamming the door. \n\n"Bloody wonderful weather, isn't it...?" Queried Johnny with a grin. \n\n"Wonderful," you replied. "I have to fly a patrol in this slop..."\n\n"You can't be serious..."  Johnny took a drag on his cigarette as he slipped the car into gear and eased away from the building.\n\nYou nodded. "Which bring's me to some news..."\n\n"Lay it on me mate," said Johnny, rolling down his  window.  He flicked his cigarette butt out the window and began rolling it back up.  " I knew there had to be something, you were up there for awhile...  good or bad...?"\n\nYou dropped your hat on the seat and wiped the rain from your face. "Depends on how you look at it, I guess... "\n\n"Out with it then, mate..."\n\n"You've been given your own squadron..."\n\nJohnny shot you a glance to read your face - he could see that you were serious... "That's friggin' wonderful!" He grinned widely, "Which one..? I'm staying here, right..? Spits..?" \n\nYou shook your head, "not Spits, sorry Johnny... you're taking over 79..."\n\nHe shrugged, "that's ok, I love my Cane anyways... I wouldn't know how to behave if I got in a Spit..." He grinned again, then his expression changed, "hey, wait a minute, what's happening with you then?"\n\n"I'm taking over 312..."\n\nJohnny nodded, "lovely! That's what you wanted, you'll get your Spit!"\n\nYou nodded. " I was just hoping we'd stay together." \n\n"Right-o... your worried you'll have to train a new wingman then, eh...? He grinned. "Better hope he's as brilliant as I am." \n\n"Not bloody likely," you laughed, "but I can hope he's as friggin lucky as you...!"\n\n**Use "RYFnm.bmp" with marking skin.**\n\n
