Short \n
Description DATE: Thursday, September 19, 1940.   10:00AM\n\nWEATHER: Cloudy with scattered rain.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Biggin Hill.\n\nSITUATION: Tuesday, September 17, Continued thunder storms and generally poor weather conditions led to the reduction of enemy air activities, only 1 sizeable raid was recorded. Wednesday,  September 18, Extremely busy, with three major waves consisting of 10+ raids with flights ranging from 50 to 200 enemy aircraft. Most were repulsed by the RAF before reaching their destinations.\n\nBoth nights experienced heavy raids on London with considerable damage.\n\nIt has been noticed that raids often appeared to originate in the Liverpool area without having been previously plotted... confirming a possible blind spot in our radar coverage.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF BIGGIN HILL : BASE HEADQUARTERS\n\nThe drizzle had stopped and you found yourself outside the headquarters building leaning against your jeep, sipping your tea. You  watched the base repair crews clean up the mess caused by Tuesday night's bombing. It wasn't much, 3 hangars... probably a damaged bomber ditching his load so he could go home. \n\nThe door opened behind you. "All set Skipper..." said Standa Peroutka, hopping into the jeep behind the wheel.\n\n"The old man clear you to fly?" You asked as you climbed into the passenger seat.\n\n"Aye, got the surgeon's report and said I'm back to duty..." replied Standa with a crooked smile and a cockney accent. He started the jeep. "Can I go up t'day Skipper?"\n\nYou nodded, "sure. we've got a sweep in about a half hour."\n\nStanda put the jeep in gear and headed toward the South pad maintenance area. "S'pose you want to go check your crate then, eh?"\n\nYou checked your watch, "it ought to be done by now..."\n\nAs you passed the mid-field on the access tarmac, Standa thumbed to the new group of tents lined in rows on the grass, "who are these blokes in the red tams, Skipper? What're they doing 'ere?"\n\n"OSS Commandos,' you replied, sipping your tea carefully. "Not sure what they're training for, but they're practicing their jumps..."\n\nStanda shook his head, "didn't much like getting out of my broken kite... can't imagine doing it out of one that still flies...poor lads must be bloody daft!" \n\nThe tea almost came out your nose when you laughed.\n\n**Use "RYFnm.bmp" with marking skin.**\n\n\n
