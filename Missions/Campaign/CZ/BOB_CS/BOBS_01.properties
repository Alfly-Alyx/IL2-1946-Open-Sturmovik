An increased number of enemy fighters flying escort with the daylight raids for bomber protection.

You will be moving to Sector 11 airfield, Biggin Hill, 312.sq. When you arrive, see the base Commander, Sir Percival, for your squadron assignment. Good luck Lad, God save the Queen.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nON PATROL - DOVER AREA:\n\nThe morning's events ran through your head...  \n\n                                            **************\n\nBiggin Hill was physically the biggest base you'd ever seen, and the busiest... with 4 fully operational squadrons based there; one Hurricane and three Spitfire. It looked like a living example of perpetual motion.\n\nSir Percival, Biggin Hill's Commander, stepped from behind his desk, "good to meet you my boy," he said with a dry smile, "at ease." He extended his hand and shook yours, his grip stronger than his small frame predicted. "Johnny here, tells me you're quite a pilot... and a reasonably good leader."  \n\nYou shot Johnny a glance out of the corner of your eye - he stood at your elbow. "Thank you sir," you replied graciously.\n\nSir Percival folded his arms across his chest and leaned back against the front of his desk. "And I understand you've just gotten married... congratulations." He smiled momentarily. "Married myself, can't for the life of me remember the last time I saw her... you'll get used to it," he added. He moved toward the window and looked out over the field. "As you can see, we're very busy here, something is happening round the clock, it never stops..."\n\n"Yes sir..." you replied, waiting patiently for a point.\n\n"We're short pilots", he continued, "we're short leaders and we're short kites"...  It is my responsibility to make sure the 'Hill' maintains as many planes and pilots in the air as possible." He turned around, his hands behind his back. "You were transferred here to fly Spitfires and 312 was going to be yours..."\n\n"Was...?" You didn't mean to interrupt, it just slipped out.\n\nSir Percival's face was expressionless. "You will be leading 79. Johnny here, will be your second, until further notice..."\n\n"Hurricanes...?" You asked.\n\n"They lost their Squadron leader on Friday," he continued, "they're younger lads and they need a strong leader until one of them is experienced enough to take over the squadron. After reviewing your records, I'm convinced that's you... Johnny will introduce you around..."                        \n\n                                         **************\n\nYou couldn't believe the condition of some of the Hurricanes... they looked like absolute wrecks, but Johnny assured you Biggin Hill's mechanics were top notch, with near magical abilities. Somehow that wasn't as reassuring as you'd expect.\n\nAt about 9000 feet, nearing Lympne, where your squadron would be posted for the day, you looked out over your wing at the other Hurricanes in your flight. The pilots of 79 seemed to be holding formation fairly well. Sir Percival had been right, they were young and some were downright green... but they had the fiery determination you'd hoped to see. The radio interrupted your thoughts...\n\n"Mother Goose to Fox Leader, Mother Goose to Fox Leader..."\n\n"Fox Leader, go ahead Mother Goose..." responding as leader made you grin a little...\n\n"What's your petrol status Fox Leader...?"\n\nYou glanced at your gauges. "Seventy percent, Mother Goose" you replied.\n\n"Understood Fox Leader. Alter course for intercept, in grid K12.  20+ bandits inbound, maintain your current altitude.  Spitfires from 616 are rising to meet you from Hawkinge..." \n\n"Understood Mother Goose."  You switched your radio to your in-flight channel... "Ok lads, remember what we practiced this morning and everybody will be going home for din-dins...\n\n**Use "BigginHill79_D" skin.**\n\n\n\n
