We are promoting you to the rank of Flight Officer. You have been assigned to RAF Tangmere to fly Hurricanes with Squadron 310. At RAF Command, we realize your training was short but you are needed in the air to defend Britain, in what is expected to be a fight for the very existence of the English people. Our Victory is paramount and to achieve that, your survival is key. No heroics, the loss of materiel and manpower is something we can ill afford. Therefore, you will do your utmost to bring yourself and your assigned aircraft home after every mission. Feel free to make use of any of our neighboring bases in an emergency, but get your kite on the ground in one piece. Listen to your Flight Leaders and learn from them, it may save your life. Good luck and good hunting. Dismissed.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, FLIGHT APRON:\n\nAs the transport plane trundles to a stop on the main apron near the Headquarter building the pilot looks back over his shoulder, "I believe this is your stop gents, this is as far as this trolly goes... You can yourself sing merrily even ´Roll out barrels...´ Welcome to Tangmere." \n\nYou thank him for the ride as you and several other new pilots gather your things and step out of the plane and down onto the concrete apron. \n\nOne of you fellow pilots nudges your arm, "got a fag and a light mate?" You shake your head, "Sorry Johnny, I don't smoke."\n\nA Flight Sergant standing on the apron with a clipboard tucked under his arm, motions you over to the Headquartes building, "go right on in there..."  An administrative ward meets your group in the lobby and directs you to a briefing room down the hall.\n\nThe breifing room is lined with maps on the walls and notes pinned to the maps create a look of organized chaos. \n\nAn Officer waiting in the room greets you with a smile, a pipe in his hand, "have a seat lads, that's all right" he gestures, "you can leave your bags along the wall, the ward will see they get to your new quarters.  I'm S/L Alexander Hess,DFC, you will be flying with me in 310 Squadron. Tangmere is a Sector Airfield which means we're quite busy,  with several squadrons based here... ... ..."\n\nThe briefing lasted for about a half an hour before you and your fellow pilots were dismissed. You and one other pilot were the last to leave the room. "One moment", said Sir Hess, "it almost slipped my mind, I need a couple of pilots to make a run to the Hurricane factory near Middle Wallop. Get a bite to eat in the mess hall and jump on that transport you came in on. He's flying over to the factory to pick up some parts and you can bring back a couple new kites waiting there for us. And I guess it would be a good time for you to get aquainted with the area... here,  fly these coordinates." He jots some notes on a piece of paper and hands the paper to you. " Enjoy the flight, but keep your eyes open. And stay out of trouble because your guns will be empty. We'll see you back here in time for dinner."\n\n**SKIN: standard, without mark.**\n\n
