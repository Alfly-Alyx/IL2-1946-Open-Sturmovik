Short Friday, August 23, 1940.  \n\nFind a needle in a haystack.\n
Description DATE: Friday, August 23, 1940.   10:00AM\n\nWEATHER: Totally overcast, scattered rain.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: Tuesday, August 20,  After reviewing the air-war efforts and progress, Churchill was quoted as saying in an address to Commons, "Never in the field of human conflict, was so much owed by so many, to so few."  Serious efforts are underway to repair damaged radar sites to correct gaps in our early warning system. Enemy air activity is light due to foul weather.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, HEADQUARTERS BUILDING:\n\nS/L Hess caught you in the corridor outside the mess hall, where you were headed for a spot of tea. Outside, the rain fell steadily, and until the main hangars were rebuilt, most of the pilots came here to pass the time between flights. The mess hall was crowded with pilots relaxing, reading, playing cards and listening to the radio. "I hate to ask anyone to go up in this bloody soup, but reconnaissance flights have been spotted over Southampton and we are the only field in the area that has a remote chance of getting anything off the ground. Westhampnett a Middle Wallop are totally socked in and their grass fields are too soaked for traffic."\n\nYou nodded, waiting for him to continue.\n\n"Think you can get a Spitfire up safely...?"\n\nYou nodded again, "sure..." even as you said it, you ran through the weather conditions in your mind and processed the risks... "Spitfire?"\n\n"Well you know the kite and in this weather you might need all the power you can get. We've got Spits of the 266 Squadron here now, but 266 is low on pilots... you'd be taking one of their kites..."\n\n"I'll go," you offer, almost interrupting.  \n\n"Good, good," he nodded, steering you down the corridor towards the front of the building. "You're going to be on your own..."\n\n"No problem," you commented.\n\n"It will probably be easiest just to fly up the coast," he continued. "Fly the Portsmouth area for as long as your petrol will hold, or until you find something. It was reported that the recon flights were at about 1000m, just under the clouds. Get  to whatever altitude gives you the best visibility." He shook your hand, "good luck lad, we'll hold a spot of brandy for you..."\n\n**Remember to release chocks for takeoff.**\n**Use "Tangmere266.BMP" skin.**\n\n
