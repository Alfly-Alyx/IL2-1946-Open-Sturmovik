Name Battle of Britain - Hurricane Season_16
Short Friday, August 16, 1940.  \n\nAIR RAID!\n
Description DATE: Friday, August 16, 1940.   12:30PM\n\nWEATHER: Warm and fair with haze and some light scattered clouds.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: Thursday, August 15, at about 5:30pm, formations totalling 150+ aircraft approached the Isle of Wight and Weymouth areas. These raids penetrated inland as far as Middle Wallop and were followed by other raids until enemy raids in this area totalled almost  300 enemy aircraft. Ten of our squadrons succeeded in destroying some 60 enemy aircraft.\n\nRaids have damaged many radar sites creating serious gaps in our early warning system.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, HEADQUARTERS BUILDING:\n\nIt was a matter of proceedure for S/L Hess to reprimand you for borrowing a kite that was not part of the 310's official inventory, but it was obvious his heart wasn't in it. Besides, you were fairly convincing that you simply took the closest, ready aircraft during a scramble... after all, it was pretty much the truth - plus or minus a minor detail or two. The fact that you bought the Spit back in pretty much the same shape as you stole, er borrowed it in, was in your favor.\n\nAn administrative steward knocked on the open office door as he stuck his head into the room, "Sir, RAF Control recieved a radio call, observers have spotted an incoming raid... their reported heading will bring them in right over us..."\n\nS/L Hess sighed and rose from behind his desk, grabbing his jacket off the back of his chair, "no rest for the weary, eh lads?"  Sirens all over the base began to howl. "Get going boy," he motioned, Godspeed."\n\nYou saluted hastily, "yes Sir," before you turned on your heel and hustled out of the room and down the corridor.\n\n"Hey...!" He called after you as he stepped into the corridor.\n\nYou slowed and turned, "Sir...?'\n\n"What did you think of her, did you like her?"  You knew exactly what he was referring to and your Cheshire Cat grin told him all he needed to know. You loved your Hurricane, it was a great little plane, but the Spitfire was beyond compare... you hoped you would get a chance to dance with that lady again.\n\nYour flight Sergeant had rolled your plane up to the ready line just outside the building... it was already running and he handed you your chute as you came running out. "Jerry's close sir, the lads are already taking off... hurry, you don't want to be caught on the ground." \n\nAs soon as you were strapped in, he slid himself off the wing like a kid going down a slide and pulled the chocks when he hit the tarmac. He waved you clear and you nudged the throttle, swinging the nose toward the taxiway. Planes were scrambling from every available parallel and there was no reason be any different... All around the base, anti-aircraft batteries suddenly opened up... You took a deep breath, slid the canopy closed and hammered the throttle. "Time to go to work..." \n\n**Remember to release chocks for takeoff.**\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_A.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
