Description DATE: Thursday, July 25, 1940 - 3:30PM\n\nWEATHER: Mostly clear with light scattered clouds.\n\nLOCATION: On patrol, currently near Middle Wallop.\n\nSITUATION: July 24, Attacks on channel shipping continue, but until today, weather had reduced activity. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nON PATROL NEAR MIDDLE WALLOP:\n\nAs you fly past the aircraft factory between Middle Wallop and Northolt, you dip your left wing to see the damage done by the Jerry bombers last Friday night. It didn't look as bad as you expected, of course they'd been working round the clock to get things back in order. It  looks like things are still in production though, because a Hurricane is taking off from the factory airstrip below you - on its way to being delivered no doubt. \n\nYour attention is diverted when the radio crackles with a call to your flight: "Mother Goose to Mama Bear... Mother Goose to Mama Bear..."\n\nYou hear your flight leader respond: "This is Mama Bear, go ahead Mother Goose."\n\n"Mama Bear, re-route your flight to grid I-9 for intercept. Radar's picking up Jerrys 20+ heading in that direction. Stay at Angels 2 and you will have advantage. Westhampnett a Kenley are on standby. Good hunting Mama Bear... Over."\n\n"Understood Mother Goose, Mama Bear out."\n\nAs your flight adjusted course, Tuesday's encounter was still fresh in your mind... the intensity, the confusion, and after it was over and you had both feet firmly on the ground, the mixture of fear and relief as you counted the holes in your Hurricane. Several of 310's canes were so badly hit they were relegated to stripdown for parts... 42 lost a couple of planes too. \n\nYou take a deep breath and tighten your harness a bit.\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_B.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
