You munched as a fuel truck trundled past. "Half my guys didn't make it back, had to stop off at Manston for fuel. We got spread out all over the place."\n\n"Mine too," Johnny added, "and I think I lost one..." he shook his head, "didn't see a chute, but I was rather busy... I hope he got out."\n\nA mechanic slid himself off your port wing, "you're loaded..." he said as he dropped himself to the tarmac.\n\n"What about petrol?" You asked.\n\n"Not yet, it's coming sir..."\n\n"How about mine?" asked Johnny.\n\n"Which one...?\n\nJohnny pointed to his Hurricane, "that one".\n\nThe mechanic nodded, "loaded, but no petrol yet." He walked off to the next kite needing a re-arm.\n\nJohnny munched his sandwich," I hate these things, bloody awful, no taste. I'd love a good piece of beef... hey, want to go to dinner with the girls again this weekend?"\n\n"Boar & Thistle...?"\n\nJohnny shrugged, "sure. I wish there was a better place, something with real class... maybe dancing. But, I guess it'll have to do," he grinned. \n\n"Food's good though," you commented.\n\n"Mmmmm," smiled Johnny, "a wonderfully juicy steak..."\n\n"And a nice stout ale," you added.\n\nThe fuel truck rumbled up near your plane and the fuel tender began unrolling the hose. "Zat your Hurricane mate...?" He thumbed over his shoulder.\n\nJohnny nodded as he finished the last of his sandwich. "Mine..." he mumbled.\n\n"She's ready mate,"  offered the fuel tender as he drug the hose over to your Spitfire.\n\nJohnny looked over his shoulder. "I'd better get her turned around then... maybe check the radio and see if I can find the rest of my lads." Johnny clapped you on the shoulder, "see you later skipper."\n\n"Right-O,"you nodded. As he walked off, you climbed up on the wing of your Spit and leaned into your cockpit to be sure your gear was where you left it. Your chute was on the seat and your goggles & cap were on the dash. The fuel tender climbed up on the wing dragging the fuel hose and opened the wing tank cap to begin fueling. You sat down with your back against the fuselage and your feet out, so you could close your eyes for a few minutes... a moment of relaxation. The air was cooler, but not quite brisk, the sun felt good on your face, your eyes still closed, your mind ignoring the ambient sounds around you.\n\nThe air raid sirens sat you bolt upright, momentarily disoriented. How long were you asleep? \n\nThe fuel tender was still kneeling on the wing pumping fuel.\n\nThe loudspeakers on the buildings around the flight line crackled: "ATTENTION - All Squadrons...  ATTENTION - All Squadrons...  SCRAMBLE!  SCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE!"\n\nYou looked around but Johnny's plane was already gone. You jumped into your cockpit and switched on your radio, donning your flight cap and pluggin in your headset. You slipped into your chute harness while standing in the cockpit. Your headset came alive, sightings of enemy flights, calls to action and calls for additional flights. You sat and reached over your shoulder for your harness. \n\n..."SIR! SIR!" The fuel tender was waving his free hand. "I'm not done SIR..!"\n\n"How much do I have...?!" You shouted.\n\n"About two-thirds of a tank...!"\n\n"That's enough! Cap it off! Cap it off! Hurry!" You began an accelerated pre-flight, dropping your flaps and testing your control surfaces. As he dropped the hose to another crewman on the ground and locked the wing tank cap in place, you flipped on your battery and other systems... "CLEAR!" You yelled and hit the starter button. The fuel tender slid off the back of the wing as the Rolls Royce pop-pop-popped and grumbled to life, a wash of exhaust following him off the wing. He waved you clear.\n\n**NOTE : Remember to release chocks**\n\n**Use "RYFnm.bmp" with marking skin.**\n\n\n
