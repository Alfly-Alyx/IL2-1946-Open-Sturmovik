Short Thursday, August 1, 1940 \n\nScramble!\n
Description DATE: Thursday, August 1, 1940 - 5:00PM\n\nWEATHER: Overcast with low clouds. No rain, but it is expected.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: July 30, Bad weather hampered enemy air activity. July 31, Dover barrage balloons  and south coast convoys attacked.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, MAIN HANGAR - ON STANDBY:\n\nIt was strange how the mist hung in the air without falling to the ground, and it was so thick you got as wet as if it were raining just walking across the apron. Another odd thing you noticed was how it seemed to hush everything around - the base seemed quieter. \n\nSitting just inside the main hanger door, you streched in your chair and listened to the pilots behind you play cards as you watched the mist swirl and drift across the base. \n\nJohnny walked up from across the apron, cigarette hanging from his mouth. "Bloody lousy weather, how's a bloke supposed to stay lit?" He drew a lighter from his pocket and re-lit his dampened cigarette.\n\n"Hey! put that out!" You admonished, taking a swipe at the cigarette... "there's petrol everywhere! You trying to blow us up!?"\n\nJohnny jumped back  and stepped back out into the weather. "Hey, watch it mate, it's my last one..." he walked toward the C47 sitting outside and stood under the wing. "Fine, I'll smoke it over here..."\n\n"Not much better," you mumbled, they just finished refuelling that thing..."\n\n"Have we heard anything?" Johnny called from under the wing.\n\n"Not a thing," you answered back, "it's been quiet... heard there were some calls inland, Northeast, it's clearer up there..."  There was a siren in the distance and you paused, the pilots stopped playing cards and everyone listened.  You stood up. "Is that us..?" The siren sounded distant and distorted in the wet weather. Then other sirens began howling. "It is us... air raid?" Everyone hustled out and scanned the skies. You picked up your gear off the chair.\n\nJohnny heard it first. "Engines..." he squashed his cigarette out on the ground. "Their not ours..." He pointed to the North, "They're coming from the North. Maybe theyre lost..."\n\n"I don't see them..." You feel the spike of adrenalin, you know you can't wait. "Lets GO!"\n\n"What?" Someone asked.\n\n"NOW! Let's GO! Get 'em UP!" You began running, your gear in hand, "Come on! GO GO GO!" Then all of you were running.\n\n"AIR RAID!  AIR RAID!"\n\nWARNING Take off outside runway and together with second flight!\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_B.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
