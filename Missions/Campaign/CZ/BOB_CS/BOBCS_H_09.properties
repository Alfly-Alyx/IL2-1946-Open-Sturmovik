Several were sunk and several more were seriously damaged.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, MESS HALL:\n\nAs you leave the mess hall, you stroll out of the main entrance and out onto the concrete in front of the Headquarters building. The evening sky is full of color and the base is relatively quiet save a lone truck driving down the far taxiway and the distant sound of the mechanics working in the hangars. \n\nSeveral men walked outside behind you. "Got a fag mate?" You shook your head and smiled, "sorry, I don't smoke Johnny, remember?" He shrugged and walked off without another word, continuing his quest  for a cigarette. You sit on the hood of a jeep parked there and sip your tea, watching the sky change colors.\n\n"The colors never cease to amaze me..." \nYou turn to see Hess standing there, packing his pipe. " It looks even better from up there," he motioned to the horizon with his pipe. He paused to light his pipe and take a puff. "Control needs a flight to escort a PBY from a rescue pickup. They're evacuating two ships that were hit in that raid earlier today... Both are a a total write-off I'm afraid. There's a destroyer and a couple gunboats taking off the able bodied... the PBY will be picking up injuries. It should be a quiet flight, want to go up? We'll take off in 10 minutes."\n\nYou nod, "sure."\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_A.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
