The ground crews were already starting the engines for warm-up.  "Let me see if I understand this," began Johnny, taking a puff... "the bloody Jerrys have nothing to shoot at because we've got nothing in the pond. So, they're out their wasting time and petrol looking for nothing..." you nod,  "...and," he continued, "instead of letting them, we're going to go out there and waste our time and petrol, looking for them - while they're looking for nothing." \n\nYou nod again, "that pretty much sums it up Johnny." \n\n"Doesn't make much sense, chasing a bloke who's chasing nothing..." \n\nYou shrug as your Flight Sergeant hands you your gear. "Can't shoot down the Jerrys if we don't go up and fly Johnny..."\n\nJohnny squished out his cigarette on the ground as he slipped into his gear. "I guess it's too much to hope that they'd just run out of petrol and crash on their own, eh...?"\n\nYou grin as you climb into your running Hurricane and look up at your Flight Sergeant as he helps you adjust your straps. "What's with the Lancasters on Pad C?"\n\n"Just passing through Sir, stopped for a spot of petrol and a bit of tea. We've been seeing alot more of them lately... Good flight Sir, Godspeed." He slid himself off the wing and left you alone with your thoughts. You nudged the throttle forward as the chocks were pulled, following your flight to the runway.\n\n** Recommendation: SKIN: Hurricane Mk.I_310sq_A.bmp, with mark.**\n\n
