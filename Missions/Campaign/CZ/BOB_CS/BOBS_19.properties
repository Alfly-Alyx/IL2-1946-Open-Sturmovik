East London seemed to be the target but minimal damage was reported. Action drifted over Biggin Hill, Hornchurch and Kenley.

Thursday, October 17, Four main raids consisting of fighters and fighter bombers, targeting Kent and parts of London.\n\nAggressive night raids on London, Liverpool and Birmingham.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF HAWKINGE : FLIGHT LINE\n\nEven though visibility had been limited all day, numerous Jerry raids crossed the Channel. But of course the weather made the interceptions problematic and 312 had been unable to locate the raids both times they went up - always a frustrating experience. The consolation was that Jerry often couldn't find his targets on a day like this so the raids would disperse.\n\nThe fog was getting thicker as the sun began to drop and the dampness was chilling. You hiked the collar of your flight jacket to cover your neck. Standing in front of the tent under the camo netting, you were making some notes in the Squadron logbook when Denny rolled up in a Jeep - he shut off the engine but stayed seated. "Think we should call it a day Skipper..? This bloody soak is closing in..."\n\nYou looked up from the logbook, "I've already got the crews packing up... Tell the Lads to get their gear, we'll warm up the kites in 10 minutes."  \n\n"Right -O!" Denny started the Jeep and popped the clutch, it's tires spinning in the wet grass. He swung it around, speeding off. Like you, Denny was more than happy to head back to the Hill so he could get dry again.\n\nSparks was walking by, coiling up telephone wires from the tent to his communications truck.\n\n"How are we doing Sparks...?"\n\nHe paused, taking a moment to neaten the coil of wire he had gathered. "Just ducky Commander, I'll be ready by the time you Lads are warming up..."\n\n"Splendid," you replied.\n\n"By the way, how's that bloke Johnny, that got his kite buggered and went for a swim...?"\n\n"Terribly pranged - amazing he didn't go for a Burton..."\n\nSparks let out a low whistle, "think he'll make it back?"\n\nYou shook your head, "doesn't look that way... he'll have a long mend."\n\nSparks sighed and finished wrapping the wire into a bundle and tossed it into the back of the Communications truck. "Lord bless the Lad, I hope he mends well..." He climbed back into the truck to continue packing up for the evening.\n\nIn the ten minutes to warmup, the mist swirled about, the sun seemed to disappear and if at all possible, it got wetter. Climbing up on the wing of your Spitfire you wiped your face and checked your watch. Most of the Lads were already in their cockpits and the crews were ready to get them off the ground and go home. The first one fired up as you pulled your canopy open and climbed in, a crewman helping you with your belts. \n\nPriming the throttle, you adjusted the choke and pushed the starter button, the starter motor whining away, rotating the prop slowly at first, then faster as the Rolls Royce engine popped then roared to life, a cloud of smoke pouring out of the exhausts and over the wings. It ran roughly at first but quickly smoothed out to a melodious rumble. At idle, the prop tips cut through the thick air and made visible swirling circles that flowed back over the fuselage.\n\n312 would take off and get above the muck and hold station for the transports that would follow, escorting them home to the Hill. One by one the chocks were pulled and the lads taxied out to the runway. \n\nWaiting for room to taxi, you slid your canopy open to respond to a waving groundcrewman. "Wait...!" he shouted.\n\nSparks sprinted out of the communications truck and up to your wing, climbing up to you at the cockpit... "Glad I caught you, Commander.  Mother Goose is calling... there's a flight of Lancasters coming back from a raid on the invasion fleet along the French coast..."\n\nYou slid your headset back so you could hear better. "In trouble...?"\n\n"Yes sir, their calling for assistance. The Jerry's will catch them before they reach Dover.  501 is at Lympne but they're dry, they've got to come down and refuel..."\n\nYou slid your headset back on, "right, off you go then..."\n\nSparks stood up, "Mother Goose said they're trading their altitude for speed -  they'll probably be relatively low by the time you reach them...!"\n\nYou nodded, "you chaps are on your own then...!"\n\nHe nodded and waved as he jumped to the ground and stepped back.  \n\nYou switched to the squadron channel and keyed your mic as you throttled up and rolled toward the runway. "Ok Lads, din-dins will have to wait, we have to escort some heavies home, looks like they might've gotten themselves into a bit of a spot... Now remember, those chaps are a bit of a trigger-happy lot, they have a tendancy to shoot at anything with wings - so stay clear of their crossfire..."\n\n**Use "RYFnm.bmp" with marking skin.**\n\n\n\n
