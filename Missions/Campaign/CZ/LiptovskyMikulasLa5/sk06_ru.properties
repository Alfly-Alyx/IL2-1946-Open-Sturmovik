Short Battle for Liptovsky-Mikulas\nLiptovsky Hradok\n
Description February 1945\n\nThe Red Army has pushed the Germans back to Liptovsky Hradok.  The left flank needs to take this town but the enemy is stubbornly holding on to it.  The town is in a good natural defensive position and it also blocks the highway and railway leading to Liptovsky Mikulas.\n\nThe center and right flank are doing better but their advance is slowed by snow-covered fields.  Letisko Mokrad is about to be overrun and soon the objective of Liptovsky Mikulas will be in sight.\n\nTime:  1530  Weather:  Clear\n\nMission:\nEight Lavochkins will provide air cover for the advancing ground troops.  The first priority is to destroy German ground attack planes so the first four will patrol at 1000m and the second four will be at 3000m. \n\nNote:  Save the track and watch the ground battle for Liptovsky Hradok on the static camera Ctrl+F2.\n
