Short Battle for Liptovsky-Mikulas\nLetisko Mokrad and Vazec\n
Description February 1945\n\nThe offensive has begun in the early morning hours.  To the north in Poland the Red Army is having little trouble brushing aside enemy troops.  But here in the mountains of Slovakia it's a different story.  The rough terrain makes movement difficult and this benefits the defenders.  \n\nBloody frontal assaults with human wave attacks will be the norm in this region.  At this point late in the war, Russia no longer has an unlimited source of manpower for its Army.  Now the new recruits are drawn from newly liberated territories.  This new source of manpower will become the new cannon fodder for the Red Army.\n\nTime:  0500  Weather:  Cloudy\n\nMission:\nSix Sturmoviks will attack German tanks at the front line near Vazec.\n\nFour Lavochkins armed with two FAB-50 bombs will attack Letisko Mokrad, the front line base for German fighters.  Four other Lavochkins will provide air cover.  Six other Sturmoviks of 1st Czechoslovak ShAP will follow in the attack.  \n
