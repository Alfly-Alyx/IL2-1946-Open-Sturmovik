Short Battle for Liptovsky-Mikulas\nVah River Valley\n
Description February 1945\nVah River Valley, North Slovakia\n\nThe 1st Czechoslovak Fighter Regiment has just moved to the front after spending a few months regrouping at Lvov, Ukraine.  The Regiment is now based at Spisska Nova Ves airfield in north Slovakia.  Here they will help in the new Soviet offensive to drive through the Vah River Valley, take the city of Liptovsky Mikulas, and advance westward, deeper into Slovakia to the border of Moravia.  \n\nThe battles on the ground will be difficult due to the mountainous terrain and fortified German positions.  Czech and Slovak soldiers in the 1st Czechoslovak Corps of the Red Army will take part in the offensive alongside Soviet units.\n\nAir cover will be provided by the Czechoslovak La-5FN fighters.  Soviet bombers and transports based further to the east will participate in the offensive.  Sturmoviks of the 1st Czechoslovak Ground Attack Regiment will also participate and will be based at Spisska Nova Ves.\n\nOnce the offensive gains ground the Lavochkin fighters will move forward to Letisko Tatry near Poprad.\n\nTime:  0800  Weather:  Clear\n\nMission:\nEight fighters will patrol the front line around Liptovsky Mikulas, four at 6000m and four at 5000m.  Watch for German fighters which typically clear the way for Stuka dive bombers.  Red Army tanks and trucks must be protected at the front line which for now is at Strba.\n
