Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nDecember 1944\n\nWe are down to our last pair of machines, and even they are sounding weary.  We scratch around for operations.\n\nThe Tedeschi are striking partisan communications routes.  You will escort them to the target.  Once they have dropped their bombs they can look after themselves.\n\nBe aware that the frontlines we mark only indicate where we believe partisans are operational.  Do not bail anywhere in this region if you can help it.\n\nWhen you return you will be stood down until we can find new machines.  I thank you for your loyalty and courage.  If there were a million of you, then Italy could still stand tall.  Go away and find love and companionship.  Consider it fortunate if you are not called to return.......\n\n\n
