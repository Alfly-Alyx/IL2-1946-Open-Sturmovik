Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nSeptember 1944\n\nIt seems that our arguments with the Tedeschi have reached an impasse.  We will not join their puppet air force.  Our generals have asked us to stand down from operations as of this minute.  This is a disgrace and a humiliation that we all find difficult to bear.\n\nYou will go forth with the scheduled mission, to hit enemy armour at the Radicosa Pass.  The Luftwaffe will not supply us with more bombs, so you will try the heavy cannons that we have had in storage.  This must be the Americans' last thrust, as all along the front they have stalemated.  It is tragic that we win the battle on the ground, but lose the battles in the ministries.\n\nGo and do your duty.  After you return, you will have a period of leave and await further orders.\n\n
