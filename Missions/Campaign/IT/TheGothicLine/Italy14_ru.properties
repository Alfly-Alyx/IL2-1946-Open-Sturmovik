Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nSeptember 1944\n\nWe have identified an Allied bomber formation heading in the direction of Bologna.  You will make a point interception, estimated position Waypoint 4.\n\nI know how you feel about these missions.  It is natural to fear the overwhelming numbers of escorts that the bombers bring with them.  Nonetheless it is our calling to fight against such odds.  The character of the Italian, the character of the Fascist, is made for such occasions.  We offer our blood as wine to the Gods.\n
