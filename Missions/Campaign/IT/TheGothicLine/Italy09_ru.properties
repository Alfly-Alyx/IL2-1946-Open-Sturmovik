Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nSeptember 1944\n\nAnd so the American 5th Army enter the fray.  They have run right into the defensive belts that we have built with our German friends.  So far they have stood firm, despite the sabotage of Communist sympathisers in the concrete factories.  The hangman's rope has cleansed this stain.\n\nDespite our mutual loyalties, and our commitment to support 14th Army, our relations with the Tedeschi have come under increasing strain.  As you are aware, they have long wanted us to come under the operational control of the Luftwaffe - something that is completely unacceptable.  If they persist with their plans for the Legione Aerea Italiana, we may have to withdraw our goodwill.  You understand the delicacy of this issue.\n\nWe shall continue operations pending further instructions.  Technicians have fitted some of the larger bombs that came batched with your machines.  You will use them against enemy armour on the road to Faenza.  Let us hope good sense prevails amongst our leaders.\n
