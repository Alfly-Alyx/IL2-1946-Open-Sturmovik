Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nJuly 1944\n\nThe measure of the Fascist is that he takes it as his duty to avoid hypocrisy.  We are not squeamish or euphemistic like the Allies about the necessity for violence.  For us violence is a supremely moral act.\n\nWe do not care to deny how many of us have died in the air from superior Allied numbers.  We expect to die.  But in this gesture we once more give birth to the notion of a greater Italy.  The Italy of Rome, that once civilised all the known world, before treachery and degraded notions of decency saw her fall.\n\nYou patrol the front lines this evening.  You will look for opportunities to offer this sacrement.\n
