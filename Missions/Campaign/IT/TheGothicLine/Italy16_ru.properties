Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nNovember 1944\n\nIt is good to see you return.  As the Luftwaffe have pulled back to their homeland, once again the ANR flies.  You will not be allocated to the main base at Osoppo, but will be allocated to Aidussina in Trieste.  You will attempt to counteract Allied air support to Tito's partisans.  Go there now, and cherish once more the privilege of flying for the Republic!\n\nPlease choose skin "Bf-109G14_1Sqn_1GrC_Malpesa_1945.bmp"\n
