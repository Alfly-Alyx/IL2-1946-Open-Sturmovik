Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nNovember 1944\n\nWe have had a report of Allied bombers heading in the direction of Graz.  You will make a point interception at Waypoint 3.  You are not expected to stop them, just disrupt their attack as much as possible while preserving your own machines.  It gives our German friends time to organise their fighter screens.\n
