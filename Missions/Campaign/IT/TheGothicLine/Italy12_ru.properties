Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nSeptember 1944\n\nThe axis of the enemy attack has switched toward the Radicosa Pass.  Their fighter-bombers once more tip the odds against the warriors of the Wehrmacht.  To stand silent in the face of such insults would bring shame.  We have diverted your morning patrol into this sector.  Expect to make contact with the Anglo-Americans.  They shall feel the force of our disgust.\n
