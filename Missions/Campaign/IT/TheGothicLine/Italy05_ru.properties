Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nAugust 1944\n\nIn comparing the English and Americans, it is difficult to see which is the worse of these debilitated races.  It is perhaps the difference between perversion and profligacy.  The English we know well as imperial bandits whose plundering of their colonies contrasts badly with the fairness of the Italian example.  As for the Americans, they are well known as mongrels who are never in full control of their louche appetites.\n\nSuch types contrast badly with the Italians and our German brothers.  Why else do they enlist foreigners to fight for them?  Foreigners from the darkest corners of the Earth who can only be tangentially classed as soldiers.\n\nRemember what this represents as you make your morning patrol.  The sanctity of our nation is in peril.\n
