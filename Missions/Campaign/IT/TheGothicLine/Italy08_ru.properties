Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nAugust 1944\n\nThe British 8th Army have attacked on the eastern flank of the front.  We must endure their lies and exaggerations of success even though we are confident of the ability of our German brothers to hold them back.  Once more destiny forces action on the true and loyal Italian people, and once more they will not be found wanting.\n\nYou shall make use of yourself by patrolling the front lines in front of the American armies.  Where the English go, their idiot descendents soon follow.  Keep looking below for signs of enemy activity, but do not become too engrossed - there will no doubt be hunters above you.\n
