Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nSeptember 1944\n\nAt last the autumn storms shed their load, and bring the enemy to heel.  The advantage switches to the righteous defenders.  Enemy air activity has predictably lessened, though they still make attacks in critical areas.\n\nOne such area is the Futa Pass, where our forces have held for a week.  Let the boys on the ground see that we fly too.  Show them our worth as warriors and allies.\n
