Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nJuly 1944\n\nMy fellow Fascisti, I am pleased that you have decided to join us here in the Repubblica di Sal\u00F2.  The iron courage of our Northern allies, together with loyal patriots, have halted the forces of the Masonic democratic capitalists on the  Arno river.\n\nAs you will be aware, the scale of the conspiracy against us is now overwhelming, from the Allied and Bolshevik forces engulfing the four corners of Europe, to the Jewish-Trotskyite traitors who form partisan groups on our own soil.\n\nNonetheless, we still hold the advantage of the superiority of our race, and of our willingness to spill blood for our cause.  Our German friends are now supplying us with planes until our factories can resume production.  The technical superiority of their arms is undiminished.  You will use them for the first time this morning on a patrol over La Spezia.\n\nShow these aggressors that the Roman heart still beats strong!\n
