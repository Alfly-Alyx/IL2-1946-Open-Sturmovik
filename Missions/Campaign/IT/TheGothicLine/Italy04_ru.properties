Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nAugust 1944\n\nWe have reports of enemy bombers heading for Genova.  You will make a point interception.  It is an illustration of the degraded sensibilities of the Capitalists that they think the morale of the Italian people can be broken by such senseless acts.  Make no mistake that this is their intention, for all their blandishments about wanting to hit railroads and their type.\n\nWe shall resist them.\n
