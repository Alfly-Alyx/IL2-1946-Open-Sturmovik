Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nDecember 1944\n\nWe have run out of spares for our Messerschmitts, as all useful parts have been diverted to Osoppo and Aviano.  The only useable machines we have left are the old Macchis.  We shall do our best with them.\n\nYou will patrol the approach route to Zagreb, which has recently been harassed by the Allies.  They come in small groups and hit communications routes.  Just do enough to shake them.  We no longer have the strength to make serious contests.\n\nPlease choose skin "vp_mc205.bmp"\n
