Description Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana\nGruppo Caccia II\nAugust 1944\n\nIt is time for you to grant a small measure of revenge on the Allies, who harrass our ground units every hour of the day.  We are aware that they are building up their forces for the inevitable offensive against our Gothic Line.  We can do but little, but the gesture of defiance will make waves.\n\nOur technicians have fitted four 50 kilogramme bombs to the bellies of your machines.  Our eyes have identified a concentration of enemy materiel at the village of San Miniato.  Go there before the light fades and destroy what you can.  It will be good for the Capitalists to hear the whistle of bombs for a change.\n
