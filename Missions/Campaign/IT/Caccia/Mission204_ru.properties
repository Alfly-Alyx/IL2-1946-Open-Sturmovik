Short April 28, 1942\nThe Siege of Malta was a military campaign in the Mediterranean Theatre of World War II. From 1940 to 1942, the fight for the control of the strategically important island of Malta pitted the air forces and navies of Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany against the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy.\n
Description Theatre 3: Malta, 1 of 3\n\nBy mid 1942, the Axis air forces ranged against the Malta island were at their maximum strength: some 520 Luftwaffe and 300 Regia Aeronautica aircraft. The main adversaries for the defenders were the 140 or so Messerschmitt Bf-109 fighters and the 80 Macchi MC202s. Main bombers units included the German Junkers Ju-88, the Italian CANT Z.1007, SM79 and Ju-87. Britain took advantage of the lull in Axis attacks to fly in 61 Spitfire Mk V aircraft from HMS Furious, which immediately improved the aerial defensive situation, although food, ammunition, and aviation fuel remained critically short. \n\nMission 7\nApril 28, 1942\n9.00 a.m\nWeather condition: good\nLocation: Trapani\n\nThe ship supply is always the best method to survive for Malta: destroy supply is destroy the island.
