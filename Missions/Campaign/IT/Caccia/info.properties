Short \n
Description Static campaign flying Italian fighters\n\nSelect rank Maggiore\n\nOn June 10, 1940, as the French government fled to Bordeaux before the German invasion, declaring Paris an open city, Mussolini felt the conflict would soon end and declared war on Britain and France.\n\nBenito Mussolini was anxious to link Italian North Africa (Africa Settentrionale Italiana, or ASI) with Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI). \n\nWhile the fighting was taking place in Libya, Axis forces attacked Greece. General Wavell was ordered to halt his advance against the Italian Army in Libya and send troops to Greece. He disagreed with this decision but followed his orders. \n\nThe Allies were unable to stop Greece falling to the Axis forces and before they could retake the initiative in the western desert the German Afrika Korps led by Erwin Rommel had entered the theatre. It would not be until early in 1943, after another year and a half of hard fighting and mixed fortunes, that the Axis forces would be finally driven out of Libya and into Tunisia by the British Eighth Army under the command of General Bernard Montgomery, after their decisive victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein.\n\nTheatre 1: Battle of Greece\nTheatre 2: Invasion of Yugoslavia\nTheatre 3: Malta\nTheatre 4: Operation Harpoon\nTheatre 5: Operation Pedestal\nTheatre 6: Lybia\nTheatre 7: Tunisian campaign\nTheatre 8: Invasion of Tunisia\nTheatre 9: Invasion of Sicily\n\n Greek and Yugoslav skins by respective authors
