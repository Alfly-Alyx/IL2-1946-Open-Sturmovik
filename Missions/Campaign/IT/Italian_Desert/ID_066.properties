Description Those P-40's were a bit of a surprise, but you all demonstrated to be excellent fighters.\n\nThis also means that the Tommies are getting more and more aid from the Yanks.\n\nWe must make sure they don't build up too much confidence. Therefore, we are preparing a joined bombing operation against the British supply lines.\n\nSix He-111's will split and attack with torpedo's any cruisers or defence ships at the harbour.\n\nA second wave of eight Caproni bombers will take care of all possible cargo ships.\n\nAt the same time, a flight of four Me110's will target any vehicles from and to the harbour.\n\nYou will be escorting the Caproni flights, while Bf-109's and Fw-190's will escort the other two formations.\n\nWatch out for fighters and never forget that your first priority is to protect the bombers.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: MC205-Arrow\nMarkings: ON\n
