Description We have lost Tobruk.\n\nMost of our supplies have been destroyed, our main supply lines disrupted.\n\nThere is not much we have left. We are launching a last attack on the British supply area just outside Tobruk.\n\nWe know that you are not a Zerstorer pilot, but this time you will have to target all trucks and other soft targets you can find.\n\nWe are sending what's left of our Bf-110 and Fw-190 squadrons into the fight.Even the Bf-109 boys will be carrying small bombs.\n\nWe are preparing to evacuate Libya, but we will strike the Tommies with one last terrible blow before we go.\n\nIf you can bring down some British fighters as well, even better.\n\nNow move it.\n\nYour attendants will have your gear packed and ready to go as you are back.... if you will be back at all.\n\nHals und Bainbruch!\n\nSkin: MC205-Arrow\nMarkings: ON\n
