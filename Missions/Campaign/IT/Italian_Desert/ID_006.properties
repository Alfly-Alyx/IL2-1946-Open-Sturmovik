Description Day 6\n\nBe ready to take off at once!\n\nOne of our Recon seaplanes has sighted a British convoy way out of their route. It probably was trying to avoid last night's storm. It also seems that some of the ships have suffered light damage.\n\nThe weather is still quite bad, yes, also in the desert it can be raining...\n\nDo not waste more time, we must find and destroy this convoy!\n\nA group of Caproni Ca-310 bombers are on their way to the last known position of the convoy, as radioed by the recon plane.\n\nYour Squadron will be escorting them.\n\nWe know that a couple of ships of the British convoy have sent distress calls, so there may be fighters providing cover in the area.\n\nDon't let them surprise you or the bombers!\n\nLand at the B3 airfield\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: CR42-Desert\nMarkings: ON\n
