Name 037
Short \n
Description We have received a strange radio message from a German Fw-200-Condor on high altitude patrol NE of the Eastern Island.\n\nThey "may have seen" a fast, low-flying plane flying in the general direction of the Tobruk area.\n\nWe actually suspect that they may have been having some schnapps to keep warm at that altitude... Of course we don't want to take any risk.\n\nThe British tanks are at the border and they are keeping strangely quiet, just as if they were preparing a massive tank-attack.\n\nPermitting the Tommies to make bomb raids would lower the morale of our Panzer Divisions.\n\nTake your wingman and patrol the area of the Panzer Division camp.\n\nDo not come back until you have downed the intruder or when your have to fly back on fumes.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: MC202-Arrow\nMarkings: ON\n
