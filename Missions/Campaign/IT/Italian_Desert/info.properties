Name        Italian Campaign in Libya
Description Guten Tag, Herr Major und Wilkommen im Libya!\n\nYou have been assigned to this theatre of operations which is, by the way, under coordination of the German Oberkommando.\n\nThe Italian Comando di Brigata Aerea has put you under our direct "protection". Your credentials have been received and we must say we are very impressed by your records.\n\nEven though this place doesn't look in any way like the elegant streets of Rome or Milan, we are sure that this is a good opportunity to show your combat skills.\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the Squadron is not here yet... Your kameraden are being commissioned as we speak. They have been chosen among the best pilots of the Italian Regia Aereonautica and will be here in a matter of days, together with the supplies.\n\nSpeaking of which... your new planes are also not here yet...\n\nBlame it on those damned pencil-pushers. This means that you will have to be patient and start to fly with the outdated Fiat CR-42 and G-50.\n\nFor a pilot of your fame, it should not be a problem to distinguish yourself, even in those slow and poorly armed planes.\n\nNow it's time to make acquaintance with your German kameraden...\n\nGood hunt and... Hals und Beinbruch!\n\n\nNOTES:\nStart the Campaign with the rank of Major (Maggiore).\nAll the planes used by your squadron will be flown using customized skins.\nThe skin to use for the mission is always specified in the briefing.\nAlways use the option "Markings ON"
