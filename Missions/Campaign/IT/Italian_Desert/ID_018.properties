Description Day 18\n\nIt was very foolish of the Tommies to send those Blenheims and the Hurris in two waves.\n\nBe sure that they won't make the same mistake twice!\n\nToday you will again provide air cover for the ground supply convoy heading SE towards the E2 Airfield.\n\nYour kameraden of the neighboring A2 airfield will also be in the air to provide extra cover with their MC-202's. At first sight they look very much like Hurricanes, so please do not shoot down any friendlies.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: MC202-Desert\nMarkings: ON\n
