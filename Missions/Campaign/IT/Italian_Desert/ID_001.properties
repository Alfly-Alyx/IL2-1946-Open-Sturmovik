Description Day 1\n\nWelcome to the Libyan Desert!\n\nWe have finally established a secure foothold on this god-forsaken place!\n\nYou and your kameraden of the Regia Aviazione will now fight side by side with the glorious German Luftwaffe.\n\nThe fierce battles of the previous weeks have not allowed for any transports to reach this area. This means that for the time being, you will keep flying CR-42's and G-50's.\n\nBerlin has sent coded orders to keep a vigilant eye on this part of the Mediterranean. The Allies are very close, but until now they have kept clear of our airspace.\n\nToday you will fly a Recon patrol in the Tobruk area. British recon seaplanes have been sighted in the area. With a bit of luck you will have something to shoot at.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: CR-42-Desert\nMarkings: ON\n
