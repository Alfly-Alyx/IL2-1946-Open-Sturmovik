They seem to be everywhere, constantly flying patrlos in the hope to catch a surfaced U-Boot.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine is very keen to protect their assets in the area, so they have asked us to increase our patrol activity along the U-Boot routes.\n\nA Class VII-C U-Boot has surfaced in sector E4 for some small repairs. Take a flight out and give them some cover.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: MC-200-Desert\nMarkings: ON\n
