Description I have good and bad news.\n\nThe good news is that we have received the newest Macchi-Castoldi planes, the MC-205-III. They are faster, better armed and with an improved sand filter.\n\nThe bad news, and I mean really bad,  is that Monty has broken through our Egyptian troops and has invaded Libya.\n\nRommel's Panzer Division will counter-attack them on all fronts. Monty's tanks are making swift incursions towards our Eastern airfields. We must give our Panzer kameraden all the support we can.\n\nToday you will escort Bf-110's attacking a tank formation moving towards sector E2. The IV Panzer will counter-attack them as well.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: MC205-Arrow\nMarkings: ON\n
