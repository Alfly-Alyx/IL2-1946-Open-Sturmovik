Description So the Tommies thought they could surprise us by throwing a couple of B25's into the battle...\n\nThey thought that the more advanced Yankee kites would be no match for us. Well, we proved them damn wrong!\n\nNow get into the air and fly protective CAP for the supply and fuel convoy making its way through the desert to Rommel's camp.\n\nI don't need to tell you that we need all the men and fuel we can, if we want to stand a chanceagainst  Monty's tank divisions.\n\nA flight of Bf109's will be on CAP directly on Rommel's camp and I can tell they will be more than eager to help out, especially when their beloved "Desert Fox" is watching them.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: MC202-Arrow\nMarkings: ON\n
