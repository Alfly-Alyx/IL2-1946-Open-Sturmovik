Description Despite the pressure we put on the British, Monty's tank divisions are moving closer and closer to Rommel's HQ.\n\nWe are sending a combined force of Caproni, Heinkel and Stuka bombers to try to stop the attackers, or at least to buy some times for our Panzer kameraden.\n\nYour Squadron will escort the Caproni bombers, while Bf-109's will escort the Heinkels and the Fw-190's will escort the Stuka's.\n\nThere will be many bandits in the air, so stay focused and don't let the fighters lure you away from the bombers.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: MC205-Arrow\nMarkings: ON\n
