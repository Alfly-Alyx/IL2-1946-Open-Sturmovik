Short \n
Description Day 24\n\nYou seem to have quite high-placed contacts at the Regia Aviazione.\n\nThey have granted your request for the new Macchi-Castoldi MC-202-III planes.\n\nHowever, the Italian Comando Tattico has messed-up things (those damn pencil-pushers are the same everywhere) and they have delivered the new kites at the wrong Airfield!\n\nA Wehrmacht truck is waiting outside the dispersal to take you and your Squadron to get those Macchi's.\n\nRemember, this is not a pleasure trip or a pic-nic. Get there, arm, refuel and get the hell back here.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: MC202-Desert\nMarkings: ON\n
