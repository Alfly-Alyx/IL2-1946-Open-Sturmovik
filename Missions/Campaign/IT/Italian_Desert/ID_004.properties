Description Day 4\n\nWe picked up a distress call from one of our German kameraden. His plane was caught up in a sandstorm during a patrol.\nThe plane was not equipped with the new sand filters and suffered a severe engine fire. The pilot was lucky enough to glide down towards the coast before ditching.\n\nA Kriegsmarine U-Boot has surfaced near his position but cannot take him aboard.\n\nWe are sending a waterplane to pick up the pilot. This plane is lightly armed, so they have asked us to send someone to patrol the area.\n\nGuess who is the lucky pilot?\n\nBritish recon planes have been sporadically sighted in this part of the Mediterranean. A surfaced submarine would be an ideal target for one of those bandits: keep your eyes open!\n\nWhen done, land at the B3 airfield\n\nSkin: CR42-Desert\nMarkings: ON\n
