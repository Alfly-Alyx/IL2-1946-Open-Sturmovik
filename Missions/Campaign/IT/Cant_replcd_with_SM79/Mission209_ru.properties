Name Mission 12
Short June 15, 1942\nOperation Harpoon was one of two simultaneous Allied convoys sent to supply Malta in the Axis-dominated Mediterranean Sea in mid-June 1942. One convoy, Operation Vigorous, left Alexandria. The other, Harpoon, travelled in the opposite direction from Gibraltar.\n
Description Theatre 4: Operation Harpoon, 3 of 3\n\nBy mid-June, 1942, Malta's supply situation had deteriorated. The Luftwaffe had joined the Regia Aeronautica to isolate and starve the island and it had become untenable as an offensive base. Axis armies had advanced into Egypt and Crete thereby acquiring their own advance bases and denying the British safety over much of the eastern Mediterranean. Fresh aircraft were regularly flown in to Malta, but food and fuel were diminishing. In response, Britain invested large amounts of effort to ensure resupply. Two convoys, codenamed Harpoon and Vigorous, were gathered, sailing simultaneously to split Axis forces.\n\nMission 12\nJune 15, 1942\n5.00 p.m.\nWeather condition: good\nLocation: Trapani\n\nThe convoy is almost destroyed, and you have to finish your duty sinking remaining cargos.
