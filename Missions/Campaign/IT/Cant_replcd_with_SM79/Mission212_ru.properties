Description Theatre 5: Operation Pedestal, 3 of 3\n\nAttempts to run the blockade and resupply Malta proved to be costly and often ended in failure; the two-pronged effort to resupply Malta during June 1942 - known as Operations Harpoon  and Vigorous - were unsuccessful. Operation Pedestal was a British operation to get desperately needed supplies to the island of Malta in August 1942, during the Second World War.The Admiralty started to plan Operation Pedestal in the early weeks of July 1942, and it was soon recognized that this was to be the main effort to relieve Malta, and would employ the largest escort force yet deployed for a single convoy, including two battleships and three aircraft carriers. \n\nMission 15\nAugust 12, 1942\n7.30 p.m.\nWeather condition: clear\nLocation: Trapani\n\nToday our submarine,  torpedo boat and air attack take out 2 battleship and 3 remain carrier, over that 4 cruiser.
