Operation Pedestal was a British operation to get desperately needed supplies to the island of Malta in August 1942, during the Second World War.The Admiralty started to plan Operation Pedestal in the early weeks of July 1942, and it was soon recognized that this was to be the main effort to relieve Malta, and would employ the largest escort force yet deployed for a single convoy, including two battleships and three aircraft carriers. \n\nMission 14\nAugust 12, 1942\n10.00 a.m.\nWeather condition: clear\nLocation: Trapani\n\nYesterday british resisted to our attack, but today we do not stop our air strike until the convoy will be destroyed.
