Description Theatre 2: Invasion of Yugoslavia, 1 of 3\n\nIn October 1940, Fascist Italy had attacked Greece only to be forced back into Albania. German dictator Adolf Hitler recognised the need to go to the aid of his ally, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. Starting on April 6, 1941, Axis armies invaded from all sides and Luftwaffe bombed Belgrade. German armies were the first to cross the border with Hungarian and Italian armies following a few days later. \nEven if Yugoslav Army was almost obsolete considering tanks and armored vehicles, the Royal Yugoslav Air Force was equipped with Hurricanes, Bf-109s and Blenheims, strongly used during the battles.\nThe invasion ended with the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on April 17, 1941, the occupation of the region by the Axis and the creation of the Independent State of Croatia \n\nMission 4\nApril 8, 1941\n10.00 a.m\nWeather condition: good\nLocation: Valona\n\nYugoslav army started an attack against North-East front of Albania: ground forces seems unadeguated, but the air cover is strong and the duty of Regia Aeronautica to stop the advance of Yugoslav troops can be difficult.
