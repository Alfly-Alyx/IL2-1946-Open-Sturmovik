We can negate the advantages of the Spitfire with our superior numbers. Capitano Doglio is again leading the Gruppo, do not take risks, I will see all of you again for lunch.\n\n     Dismissed.'\n\nAltitude:-\nClose escort 5000 m \nHigh cover 8000 m\n\nMeteo:-  Hazy, low cloud.\n\nAeroplane:- Folgore\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC202vii.bmp\n\n20o Gruppo 51o Stormo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi historical)\n
