Description 12th August 1942.  time:- 17.30\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nOur attacks throughout today have managed to sink several merchant ships and damage another carrier and have caused many of  the larger escorting warships to turn back yet still the convoy continues.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nOur agents have discovered this convoy is codenamed 'Pedestal' .\n\nIt is imperative that the remaining ships in the convoy 'Pedestal' are sunk or damaged enough to give up their attempt to get to Malta.\n\nOur experimental weapons did not yield the results we would have wished.\nWe lost control of a remote controlled explosives packed Cant floatplane (and it crashed in North Africa)....and our Sparviero's dropped their Motabomba (zig-zagging parachute bombs) from too high and too far away...yet our conventional weapons remain effective.\n\nYou do not ever seem to get much of a break and now you will be flying with the 20o fighter Gruppo again.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nWe have sent waves of attacks throughout the day and will continue to throw everything we have at the British navy until this convoy is sunk.\n\nEscort Luftwaffe  Ju88  and He111 torpedo bombers in their attack on the convoy.\n\nThe British are going to try and put everything they have got into the air above that convoy including planes operating from Malta, so be especially alert.\n\nWatch your fuel as this is right on the edge of your operational range\n\nAltitude:-3800m\n\nMeteo:- Good\n\nAeroplane:- Folgore\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC-202vii .bmp\n\n20o Gruppo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n\n\n
