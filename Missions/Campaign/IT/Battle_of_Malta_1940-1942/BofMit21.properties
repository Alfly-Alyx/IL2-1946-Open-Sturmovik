Short \n Scramble mission vs Beaufighters.\n
Description 10th May 1941 Time:13.30\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSituation:- \n\nAll of our transport planes are being diverted to Greece. It is easy to guess that this is probably for a future operation against the Island of Crete.\n\nThere are many rumours on Catania airfield about disunity in the North African armies, Rommel blames his lack of progress on the Italians, and the Italians cite the Trento division having come to the rescue of the German 5th light division when overwhelmed by British Matilda tanks....either way Italians and Germans have both refused to advance to Mersa Matruh due to lack of supplies, to further compound problems, Rommel keeps appealing to Hitler directly, over the heads of his Italian and German Chiefs of Staff.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nCombat orders:-\n\nLast night you had a little time to visit Corona and marvel at the strange mixture of beautiful baroque and modern industrial architecture. You ate in a good restaurant, then there were several bars and then those Germans with all that Schnapps.... Hells teeth...you hope that Officer didn't mean what he said this morning.\n\nSCRAMBLE !\n\nEnemy bombers have just cleared the coastline near Syracuse, ETA about 3 minutes.\n\nGet to the Fiat G50's and protect the airfield.\n\nYour Aeroplane:- Fiat G50\n\nSkin:- default\n\n(semi-historical)\n
