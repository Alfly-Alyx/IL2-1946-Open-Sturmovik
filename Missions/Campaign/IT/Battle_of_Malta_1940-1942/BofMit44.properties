You all know where that is by now !.\n    Two Squadrilie, One from 10o Gruppo and  re2001's of 2o Stormo  are to provide the top cover under the command of Capitano Roberto Degazzo. \nI believe Sergente Maggiore Martinoli can tell you all about the re2001, he certainly made it fly very fast.\n   Yesterday was a hard combat if your reports are accurate....and illustrate the importance of having the altitude advantage.\n    Following behind you will be a large formation of German bombers with their own escort....they are using us as the 'bait ', so after you have drawn the fighters out, Junkers 88's will finish the job of flattening the airfield (again). \n  Good luck and take care of each other up there, I don't so much want kills and statistics (he whispers....those are for the Germans...)  but to see you all returned safely back here this evening.'\n\nYou are providing close escort to our bombers  with Sergente Maggiore Martinoli and the 9o Gruppo .\n\nAltitude:- 5200m\n \nMeteo:-  fair visibility, low cloud\n\nAeroplane:-  Folgore\n\nSkin:- 03-Malta MC202_VII_Dark4th Stormo.bmp\n\n9o,10o Gruppo's 4o Stormo and 2oStormo 'experimental'.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(Historical)\n
