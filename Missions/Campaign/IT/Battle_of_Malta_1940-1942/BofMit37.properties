Short A guest of the Luftwaffe\n            \n
Description Date:23rd January 1942      time:- 07.13        \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nJapan launched a surprise attack on the American fleet in Pearl Harbour on December 11th and to honour the Axis Pact, Mussolini had no choice but to also declare war on the United States. This has made many people uneasy as they have relatives in the United States.\n\nIn North Africa the British launched an offensive and managed to relieve Tobruk but it was a pyrrhic victory as the Italian divisions fought very hard, again saving the Africa Korp, and inflicted major losses on the Commonwealth troops.\n\nIt has been a harsh and unrelenting winter in Russia. Both sides have dug in and it has become too cold even for aerial operations.\n\nMalta has been hard but from what you have heard, Russia has been almost intolerable for the Regia Aeronautica, our equipment is just not designed to operate in such conditions.\n\nThe Luftwaffe were not prepared for the winter either and they have reclaimed their Sicilian bases and transferred the II Luftflotte to Sicily to renew the aerial assault upon Malta.\n\nThe plan now is to escalate the bombing to overwhelm the defences until it is possible to launch Operation 'Hercules', the invasion of Malta.\n\nOur human torpedoes scored a notable success in mid December when they got into Alexandria harbour and damaged the Battleships 'HMS Valiant' and 'H.M.S Queen Elizabeth'.\n\nThe British managed to steam some small convoys into Malta earlier this month.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nYou have enjoyed your period of leave but now you are back in Sicily at Catania airbase. \n\nYou have heard much about the quality of German equipment and this morning you are going to fly with the jg53 'Pik As' in order to evaluate a bf109f4.\n\nA technician has talked you through the instrumentation and the flight controls appear similar to a Folgore, although the cockpit is very cramped by comparison.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nJu88's are launching attacks on the recently arrived merchant ships in Le Valletta harbour, before they can be unloaded.\n\nYou are flying escort duty.\n\nStay with your formation and try to stay out of the flak over the harbour.\n\nYou are to land at Catania (see flight plan).\n\nAltitude:- 3000m\n\nMeteo:-  Clear\n\nAeroplane:-  Messerschmidt Bf109f\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta jg53.bmp\n\nJg53\n\n(airstart)\n
