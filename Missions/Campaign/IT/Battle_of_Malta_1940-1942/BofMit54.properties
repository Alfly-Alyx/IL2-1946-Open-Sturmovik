Description Date: 12th August 1942.  time:- 16.00         \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nIn Russia the Italian army has been reinforced to about 200,000 men who are fighting to hold the Don river against a savage Russian offensive.\n\nIn North Africa the opposing armies are exhausted and deadlocked, the Italian X corp advanced to Siwa.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nAfter the hard fighting of last month, the 20o Stormo have been given a wrest period to get over the recent month and the death of Capitano Furio Niclot Doglio. Ennio Tarantola is recovering from a wound he received whilst trying to save his friend Doglio.\n\nYou have been sent to Sardinia again to recover your nerves and help to train an inexperienced Stormo, pilots now more than aircraft, are in increasingly short supply and the Regia Aeronautica is reaping the rewards of having no formal pilot training beyond basic flight school.\n\nThe 10o Gruppo Autonomo that were in Sardinia before have long since gone to North Africa to Abu Haggag to rejoin a conflict that has required almost endless resources.\n\nYou are now responsible for helping to train the replacement pilots of 150o Gruppo Autonomo CT recently returned from North Africa. \n\nThey fly older Saetta's which have found a new lease of life in a ground attack role.\n\nMost of the pilots are completely inexperienced and have never flown a combat sortie, if the 10o Gruppo Autonomo pilots made you feel old, these pilots make you feel like a grandfather !.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nYou have been in Sardinia for about a week and memories of the air battles above Malta have just begun to fade when Maggiore Antonio Vizzotto calls you into his office:-\n\n         'Welcome Pilot instructor, You better have a drink because what I am about to tell you will be painfully familiar...infact have the bottle...you can have the whole damn bar as far as I am concerned...but after you land !.\n\n.....We are the most Westerly operational Gruppo with fighter capability at the moment.\n\nOur agents in Spain spotted a large, fast moving and heavily escorted allied convoy leaving Gibraltar the day before yesterday. \n\nA rat is most dangerous when in a corner,this must be a final act of desperation before Malta is forced to surrender ?.\n\nYesterday our MAS boats and submarines launched a valiant attack against the convoy and inflicted damage and U73 sank the carrier 'Eagle' but we need to use our airpower to stop the merchant ships getting through to Malta. \n\nWe are going to have to ask you to lend your experience and risk your life flying with my pilots during this attack....I am aware that such a request is above and beyond the call of reasonable duty for a man on leave...but we have no other option available to us.\n\nI will give you the flight plan and you can pick the best of our pilots, you may not be senior in rank but it is you whom we are now all reliant upon !.\n\nThis is a combined operation and you will be escorting Luftwaffe Ju88's and S79sil 'Sparvieros'.\n\nDo your calculations carefully because this is right on the edge of your operational range and you will be running on fumes for the last few miles.\n\nIf anyone has to ditch we will get our CantZ floatplane's out to pick them up.\n\nThe Saetta is an outdated plane in a fighter role but fortunately the Royal Navy do not deploy modern fighters from their carriers yet either.\n\nI will make sure you receive a special citation for this !'  \n\nAltitude:- \nA flight - High cover to the Ju88's, 4000 m.\nB flight - 1500 m, flying close escort to the S79sils Sparviero.\n\nmeteo:-  Clear with low cloud.\n\nAeroplane:- Saetta\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC200ser3.bmp\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n\n
