This is most certainly an attempt by the Germans to reinforce Mussolini's declining popularity.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nEnnio Tarantola has recovered from his wounds and is flying with the 20o Gruppo again. \n\nThe 155o Gruppo have reinforced the fighter contingent.\n\nThe battle in the skies above Malta has become more vicious and deadly than ever before...and although we can still put more planes in the air, we are loosing numerical superiority as the Allies seem to be able to replace every plane that we claim with two more.\n\nAlso the Spitfires are intercepting our formations further out to sea  and so fewer formations are dropping their bombloads.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nThis morning fighters of the 20o and 155o Gruppo are to escort ju 88's of the I/KG54 in a raid on Hal Far. A flight of  bf109's are providing high cover.\n\nAltitude:- \nA,B,C flight Close Escort 5000 metres\nD flight High Cover 7500 metres.\n\nMeteo:-  Poor, high cloud.\n\nAeroplane:-Folgore \n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC202vii .bmp\n\n20o Gruppo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n\n
