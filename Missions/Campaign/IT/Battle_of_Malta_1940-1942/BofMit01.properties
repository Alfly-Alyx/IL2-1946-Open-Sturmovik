Short \n
Description Date: 11. June 1940 - time: 16.25\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\n"The function of a citizen and a soldier are inseparable." - Benito Mussolini\n\nItalian aviation is the envy of the world, our aerobatic teams are without equal.\n\nAir Marshal  Italo Balbo  is an international hero after the non stop transatlantic flights of our Cant Z55 flying boats to Rio de Janeiro and New York.\n\nAfter Germany's lightning victories in Poland and France, Italy has joined the Axis pact and declared War on England and France.\n\nMussolini has promised that he will bomb Malta into oblivion and turn the Mediterranean into an Italian lake.\n\nThere is political trouble brewing however as Italo Balbo disagrees with the aggressive policy's of Hitler most passionately and does not think there should be a war with Britain, there have been public arguments between him and Mussolini since the invasion of Poland.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nIn preparation for this war you were called back from the reserves to serve again in the Regia Aeronautica. Unfortunately there has been a mix up in the paperwork and your superiors are unsure as to your designated Squadriglie,Gruppo or Stormo.\n\nYou are posted to Sicily and temporarily assigned to the 79a Squadriglie, 34o Stormo who are operating from Comiso airbase whilst most of the bombers fly from Catania airfield to the North. There are many advantages as you are close to the bustling city of Syracuse.\n\nYou once flew as an aerobatic pilot so they should soon find plenty for a pilot of your superior skills...\n....as soon as you get off this reprimand for frightening the Papal Pontiff of Syracuse with your aerobatic antics recently...\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nOur Stormo's  flew sorties against Malta yesterday and throughout today.\n\nOver the Island we are almost unaposed.\n\nOccasionally the English attempt to attack us in a few antiquated biplanes but they are no match for our modern aeroplanes and we climb above them.\n\nWe will overlook your misdemeanours and you will escort two S79 'Sparviero' (Sparrowhawk) bombers as they photograph the results of today's raids.\n\nJust after you cleared the Sicilian coastline your Squadriglie flew into a cloudbank and when you emerged you were all alone...\n\nAltitude- 4000m\n\nRemember to watch your fuel gauge.\n\nAeroplane:-Saetta (Arrow)\n\nSkin:-01-Malta MC200ser3\n\n79a Squadriglie, 34oStormo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(Historical)\n
