Description Date: 15th June 1942.    time:- 05.30        \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nOur forces in North Africa are low on fuel and ammunition but Bir Hacheim finally fell to us four days ago.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nIt seems that our attack yesterday caused enough damage for the English cruisers and carriers to think better than trying to run through the straits.\nThe convoy continues but without the capital ships as escort. \n\nLate last night, the 7th Cruiser squadron under the command of Admiral da Zara on the 'Eugenio de Savoia'  left Palermo to engage the remaining merchant ships and destroyers.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nYou are not overjoyed to get your sleep interrupted in the small hours of the morning.\n\nThe Regia Marina need a spotter plane in the air to track the convoy and to observe the fall of shells when they engage. \n\nFly from Sardinia to the correct position and perform this task for us.\n\nThere should be a Cant Z320 overhead but we want to be absolutely certain that victory does not slip through our fingers due to a faulty radio or unlucky AA burst.\n\nThe greatest risks that you face are enemy AA, getting lost due to poor navigation, or the outside possibility of a 'Hurri-cat' ('one-launch' Hurricane catapulted from merchant ships.).\n\nUpon completion of this task,  return to Comiso airbase in Sicily with the details of the convoys position and give them to the base commander.\n\nAltitude:- Optional\n\nMeteo:-  heavy low cloud\n\nAeroplane:- Falco\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta Cr42 .bmp\n\n(airstart)\n
