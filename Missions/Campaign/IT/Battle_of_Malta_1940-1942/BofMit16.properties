Short \nEscort Recon plane over Malta\n
Description Date: 15. February 1941 - time:  05.45\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nDuring the night our bombers continue to drop huge payloads of bombs on the port and airfields of Malta whilst the Luftwaffe pound tactical targets during the daytime, we are in no doubt that the  garrison cannot continue to fight on for much longer.\n\nTowards the end of last month Tobruk fell to the British and more recently Benghazi, the capital of Cyrenaica. We have lost hundreds of tanks and guns and thousands of men in North Africa. Many more planes are being transferred there to help prevent this reverse from turning into a route.\n\nThe good news is that our divisions fighting in Greece, in conjunction with the German 'Panzers' have made great gains and have fought their way over the mountain passes in the North of Macedonia.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nWe are feeling the consequences of the heavy attacks on the 'HMS illustrious' last month and this coupled with unexpected requirements in North Africa have resulted in a shortage of modern Saetta's. \n\nYou will continue to fly Falco's for the present as that is all we have.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nToday you will escort a reconnaissance plane over Le Valletta to access the results of the night bombing.\n\nYou will be flying very high and this should minimise your chances of encountering enemy interceptors. (although don't forget to check your oxygen before you need it !). \n\nThe Falco's engine runs better at this altitude with a lower fuel ratio in the mixture.\n\nAltitude:- 4800m\n\nMeteo:- Morning mist  \n\nAeroplane:- Falco\n\nSkin:-01-Malta Cr42.bmp\n\n23 Gruppo 'Nucleo'\n\n(airstart)\n
