Description Date:27th July 1942.      time:- 14.30         \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nThere is concern about the state of Mussolini's health and the survival of the Fascist state if anything should happen to him. He has returned to Italy. Egypt has not fallen to us.\n\nAxis forces in North Africa are exhausted and maximum effort is being made to give them as many modern planes, tanks and artillery pieces as can be made available.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nYou continue flying with the 20o Gruppo. \nLosses are mounting and with the cancellation of Hercules and no obviouse end in sight, morale amongst the pilots is at an all time low.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nMaggiore Luigi Filippini  is  dour  and lacking in humour, he twitches and looks over his left shoulder, then his right :-\n\n      'Today we are flying a combined operation with the Luftwaffe. A flight of Ju88's are going to bomb Ta Kali airfield whilst the JG53 fighter boys provide close escort.\n   It is down to us to provide general high altitude fighter cover.\n     Capitano Doglio is again leading the Gruppo.This is in full daylight so again we can guarantee you will see action.\n    For month after month we bomb the hell out of the Maltese and British, starve them...and it doesn't appear to make much difference...each time we return there are Spitfires in the air, sometimes even more Spitfires, I have nightmares about damned Spitfires.....anyhow I digress... Good luck my friends, stay high and maybe leave it to the 'professionals' of the Luftwaffe ?  (....and thats off the record )\n\n     Dismissed.'\n\nAltitude:- 7000 metres\n\nMeteo:- Fair   \n\nAeroplane:- Folgore\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC202vii.bmp\n\n20o Gruppo 51o Stormo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi historical)\n
