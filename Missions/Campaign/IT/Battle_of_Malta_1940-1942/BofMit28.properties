Description Date: 15th August 1941. time:- 05.15\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nThe last British convoy got through to Malta but the day afterwards we launched an attack by human manned torpedoes and MAS boats filled with explosives. These attacks did not succeed however they are certain to have demoralized the defenders.\n\nBruno Mussolini, Benito's son, died while in a training flight on a P108 Bomber in Pisa, Italy. Mussolini is said to be mortified.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nFor over a year now we have attacked Malta from the air and it has cost the lives of many brave men.\nThe island will never be worth what it has cost to us but whilst the British still hold it we shall never control the Mediterannean. \n\nWe often send out Cant Z506B seaplanes in the morning after a heavy raid to pick up any downed aircrews that may have had to ditch in the sea.\nAlthough marked with red crosses, this does not always dissuade our enemy from attacking them.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nWe have had a report from a search plane that enemy fighters are heading towards our seaplanes.\n\nYou are to proceed to the area at top speed and ensure that our planes return home safely with their precious cargoes.\n\nAltitude:- 1000m\n\nMeteo:- Misty\n\nAeroplane:-Saetta\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC200ser3.bmp\n\n23o Gruppo CT.\n
