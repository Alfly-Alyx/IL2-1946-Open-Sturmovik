Description Date: 03. April 1941 - time: 22.30\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nIn Greece our victorious armies continue to win great victories and are getting into position for the final assault upon Athens.\n\nSix days ago we lost three heavy cruisers and their escorting destroyers in the disastrous Battle of Cape Matapan.\n\nLast month we dropped an estimated 152,000 pounds of bombs on Malta.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nYou are called into the C/O's office, with him is a dour looking middle aged German officer in a leather greatcoat, the C/O is uneasy and more concerned about your appearance than usual:-\n\n \t\t'Attention when I address you pilot,\nYou have flown many aircraft and perhaps experienced more than most of our pilots as a result of the beurocratic problems surrounding your assignment papers....\n\t\tPerhaps we will disregard your papers, from now on you are to be attached directly to the combined German/Italian Sicilian Commando.\n\t\tWe expect you to fly wherever required to access the morale of our pilots for us and give your opinions on the effectiveness of equipment and operations. You will retain your current rank so as to not arouse suspicions amongst the men that you serve around. \n\tDo you think you can do this for us ?.\nI have heard it is very cold in Russia at the moment .\n\tGood thats settled then.\n\tDismissed.'\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nYou are driven to Catania airfield in a staff car. The airfield is much larger than Comiso and German and Italian bombers line the taxi ways. Looking around at the service vehicles, sentry guards and AA emplacements, Catania has become more German than Italian.\n\nTonight you will be flying aboard a He 111 bomber of the German X fliegercorp, as an observer.\n\n(so unless you are competent at night navigation and precision bombing, replace a gunner)\n\nTarget for tonight is the Submarine pens on Manoel Island in Malta harbour.\n\nMission Altitude- 2500metres\n\nOur meteorologists predict reasonable weather but a moonless night with high cloud\n\n10 minutes to target and the pilot complains of terrible stomach cramps, it looks like it is time that you learnt to fly a bomber...fast...\n(turning on your cockpit lights will help a lot)\n\nyour airplane:- HeIIIH\n\nOrdinance:- 4XSC250\n\nSkin:-01.Malta He111H nm.bmp\n\n(airstart)\n
