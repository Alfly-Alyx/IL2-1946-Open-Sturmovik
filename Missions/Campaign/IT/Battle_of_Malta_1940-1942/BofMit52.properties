Description Date:10th July 1942.     time:- 07.30         \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nToday was the day that operation 'Hercules' was due to start if it had not been for Rommel appealing directly to Hitler against the wishes of Kesselring, Mussolini and Ugo Cavallero....if he takes Egypt he will be proven correct...but if he doesn't...\n\nWith the further imposition of severe rationing and extreme shortages, turn abouts in Africa and Russia  and ever mounting casualties, the war is becoming less and less popular with the people of Italy.  As enthusiasm for war declines so does support for Mussolini.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nYou remain with the 20o Gruppo.  Combat in the skies above Malta is hard and unforgiving, many good pilots are being lost or captured over the island, men that cannot be replaced.\n\nYour fellow pilots seldom talk about what they actualy believe, they have a job to do and that is to fly their aeroplanes and try to save the lives of other Italians and Germans that also fly aeroplanes.\n\nIn private however pilots have beliefs as varied as the ideologies that are being fought over, some of the best pilots you have known would fight against Fascism if given a chance.....\n\nYou are not a political stoolpigeon and you decide it better not to know about your colleagues beliefs incase you are ever put into a compromising position by the ItalJaeger, if a pilot flies his plane with skill and does his duty then that is enough !.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nMaggiore Luigi Filippini twitches and looks over his left shoulder, clears his throat and begins to speak:-\n\n      'Today you are escorting a Breda reconnaissance plane over Ta Kali airfield so we are putting all of you into the air in either a close escort or high cover role. Again this is an excuse for a fighter engagement and these days the enemy often ignore Breda's or single Sparvieros and head straight for our fighters.\n     We are flying a combined operation with the Luftwaffe JG53 fighter boys so get your aircraft recognition upto scratch.... they think they can do better than we have, let us see !.\n     Capitano Doglio is again leading the Gruppo, this is in full daylight so I can guarantee you will see action today. Good luck my friends....\n\n     Dismissed.'\n\nAltitude:-\nClose escort 5000 m\nHigh cover 8000 m\n\nMeteo:- Clear but with some cloud   \n\nAeroplane:- Folgore\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC202vii.bmp\n\n20o Gruppo 51o Stormo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi historical)\n
