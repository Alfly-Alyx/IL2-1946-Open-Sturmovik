Short Escort supply planes to North Africa\n            \n
Description Date:26th February 1942   time:-  07.20 \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nThe Africa Korp have again overrun their lines of supply and whilst the British Fleet remains in control of the sea, the only sure method we have of getting supplies to North Africa is to fly them there.\n\nOur bombers in Crete caught a small convoy trying to run supplies from Alexandria to Malta, all four merchant ships in the convoy were sunk and some of the escorts badly damaged.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nNew pilots arrive from the flight schools but they have been given only basic flight training and so it is upto the Stormo's to give them combat training. There is usualy not time to do this and consequently new pilots have little chance in the air and most do not survive the first few combat missions.  \n\nLast night your Gruppo transferred to Catania airbase.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nThe Luftwaffe are using their gigantic four engined me323 transporters to ferry supplies to Tripoli.\n\n13o Gruppo are to provide the fighter escort.\n\nTake off and rendezvous with the transporters and fly part of the way to Tripoli with them.\n\nYou should meet an escort of Bf 110's as you approach your turning point.\n\nWatch your fuel gauge as this is on the edge of your range.\n\nYou are to land at Comiso (see flight plan)\n\nMeteo:-  moderate\n\nAeroplane:- Saetta\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC200ser3 .bmp\n\n13o Gruppo \n\n(time skip recommended)\n
