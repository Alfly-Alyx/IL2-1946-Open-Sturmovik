Short \n Sweep with 20o Gruppo           \n
Description Date:1st July 1942.     time:-18.45         \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nWe won a great naval victory over the British convoy but there are repercussions and we do not have enough fuel for our navy to operate in such a way again. \n\nFuel rationing has become very strict and vehicles are not permitted to run unless for very specific military purposes.\n\nIt is vital that Axis armies can take oilfields in either Egypt or the Caucasus in order for our military and industry to have enough oil to continue to function.\n\nIn North Africa we have retaken Tobruk with 33.000 POW's, 2000 vehicles, 400 guns and much needed fuel.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nThe 20o Gruppo, 51o Stormo are the indigenous Roma-Ciampino (Roman) fighter unit and they have a service history with long periods in North Africa.\n\nThe commander is Maggiore Luigi Filippini and he undoubtedly knows his job, of special note are two high scoring 'aces', Sergente Ennio Tarantola and his Capitano, Furio Niclot Doglio.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nMaggiore Luigi Filippini's face is craggy and weather-beaten with deep creases beneath his eyes, he has a twitch and frequently looks over his left shoulder as if checking his tail-\n\n'Here we are once again boys....and I have orders to win air superiority over Malta....after that we have to steal Santa Clause's sleigh because the brass at the Regia Aeronautica believe it may have excellent handling characteristics....'\n\n(there are quiet chuckles from the men that have become used to Filippini's briefings)\n\n'So I suppose it is down to damage limitation, three flights are to fly  a very high sweep across the Island as fast as possible and get back here for the evening meal followed by a dance to which I have heard many of the local girls are invited. Now don't do anything rash up there and compromise your chance's of having lots of little brats.\nCapitano Furio Niclot Doglio is leading and you watch out for him Ennio, he owes me money !\nDismissed.'\n\nAltitude:- 7000 metres\n\nMeteo:- Good, clear evening with little cloud\n\nAeroplane:-Folgore \n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC202vii.bmp\n\n20oGruppo 51o Stormo.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi historical)\n
