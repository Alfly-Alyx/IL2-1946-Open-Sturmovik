Description Date: 05. August 1940 - time: 13.20\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nThe Luftwaffe and Regia Aeronautica are fighting a desperate battle in the sky's above England. News from the pilots there is that the Germans are not treating them with much respect and a device called Radar is giving the English a big advantage.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat briefing:-\n\nThe enemies antiquated biplanes and the occasional 'spitfire' have had little effect upon our operations but they have shown an uncanny ability of always being in the air in the right place at the right time....\n\nIt is not much of a deductive leap to presume that Malta probably also has Radar.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nYou are to continue flying with the 23o Gruppo.\n\nToday the Gruppo are to escort S79 Sparviero Bombers attacking ships in Malta harbour.\n\nDespite the RAF's weakness, our fighter escort has not been proving all that effective and this inability to protect our bombers is not good for the bomber crews moral. Remember that protection of our bombers is your priority.\n\nAltitude:- 4000m\n\nMeteo:- Cloudy with average visibility.\n\naeroplane:-Falco\n\nSkin:-01-Malta-Cr42.bmp\n\n23oStormo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(Semi Historical)\n
