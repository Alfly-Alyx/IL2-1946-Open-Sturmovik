Description Date: 03. July 1940 - time: 11.30\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nPlanes and soldiers are being redeployed to North Africa and the Balkans.\n\nMussolini says on the radio that it will not be long now until the British are thrown entirely from the Mediterranean, he calls this time the foundation of the second Roman Empire.\n\nIn the skies over Tobruk the Air Marshal, Italo Balbo, was tragicaly killed in a friendly fire incident when his plane was shot down by  the cruiser 'San Giorgio'. This has caused a lot of speculation because he was very popular and did not agree with Mussolini.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nThe British aviators fight bravely but they are outnumbered and  poorly equiped.\n\n4o Stormo CT, flying a mixture of Fiat Cr42 Falcos and MC200 Saetta's   transferred to Sicily yesterday.\n9o Gruppo consisting of 73a,96a and 97a Squadriglie's, fly the Falco biplane.\n\nThe Falco is much loved by its pilots.\n\nYour assignment papers still have not arrived so you will fly with this Gruppo today on its first mission over Malta.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nYou are to escort two S79 Sparviero's on a Reconaissance.\n\n9o Gruppo is commanded by Maggiore Ernesto Botto.\nMaggiore Botto is a biplane ace decorated with the Megdalia D'oro al Valor militare and nicknamed 'Gambi de ferro' (Old Iron Leg) by the Stormo. He won his reputation in the Spanish civil war  and lost a leg as a result of combat.\n\nHe  speaks calmly and with confidance:-\n\n     'Fellow aviators of the 4o Stormo, today is the first time that we fly against this new enemy, so is the life of an aviator,full of surprises, today some of you are with a new mistress, an older women yes, but still capable of surprises and very nimble. \t\n\tTreat her with caresses and she will pay you back many times over, fight against her and your life will be short and filled with regret !.\n    I want you to stay in tight formation and look to your leaders, always look over your shoulder, one eye to the front and another for the rear, we learnt this fighting for Franco.\n    I see we have the aerobatic pilot with us.\n     ( he smiles at you)\n    Well my friend, I want to see no aerobatics from you today. We depart as a Gruppo and we will land as a Gruppo.\n    Now get to your Mistresses.\n    Dismissed.'\n\nMeteo- Poor visibility with medium cloud\n\nMission Altitude- 3000m\n\nyour aeroplane:- Falco (Hawk)\n\nSkin:-01-Malta-Cr42.bmp\n\n9o Gruppo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(Historical)\n
