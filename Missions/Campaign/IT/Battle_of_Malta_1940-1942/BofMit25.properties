Short \n Recon escort over Malta Harbour.\n
Description 17th July 1941 Time:09.30\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSituation:- \n\nWe seem to be re-establishing air superiority over Malta although it is still a tough contest and we are doing this despite the absence of most of the Luftwaffe.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nYou are to continue flying with the 10o Gruppo.\n\nKeeping record of what has been bombed successfully and what needs to be attacked again is a constant task for our intelligence.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nThis morning you are to escort two Breda65b's over Malta Harbour to access continuing damage from our night raids.\n\nSaetta's of the 10o, 7o and 46o fighter Gruppo's are to fly escort.\n\nViews as to how to escort slow flying planes have changed, close cover is necessary but now fighters also fly high or general cover, which gives them more scope for initiative and a higher altitude, although flying with oxygen is more tireing.\n\nYou are flying high cover today with Capitano Franco Lucchini.\n\nAfter takeoff there have been some flight coordination troubles and the 46o Gruppo have not made contact, it has been decided to continue with the mission anyway.\n\nAltitude:- 6500m\n\nMeteo- Low cloud fair visibility.\n\nAeroplane:- Saetta\n\nSkins:- 01-Malta MC-200_III4st.bmp\n\n10o & 7o Gruppo. 4o Stormo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n
