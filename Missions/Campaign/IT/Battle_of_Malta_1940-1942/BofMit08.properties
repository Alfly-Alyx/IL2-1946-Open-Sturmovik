Description Date: 05. September 1940 - time: 07.45\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nOur newspapers are declaring that the end of this month will bring victory over Malta and the invasion of England.\n\nThe truth is not as simple, in the air the RAF are using the limited aeroplanes that they have available with great skill and courage, our enemy is worthy of extreme respect.\n\nIn war the first casualty is the truth !.\n\nYesterday the British fleet launched an air strike from their carriers against our airfields in Rhodes, they did little damage and lost several aeroplanes.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nIt is near the end of the automobile racing season and most pilots have fast cars, many of them enter the races.\n\nReports of enemy monoplanes have become more frequent during recent days and flyers speak more frequently of sighting 'Spitfires'. It is difficult to understand how an enemy plane that is not even present in this theatre can have such an impact !\n\nThe best advice anyone could give is to remember the words of Maggiore Ernesto Botto:- '...always keep one eye for the front and one eye for the rear...'\n\nYou continue to fly with the pilots of the 23o Stormo.\n\nMission brief:-\n\nToday you are to escort S79 Sparvieros of the 34o Stormo, in a raid against Le Valletta harbour.\n\nAltitude:-4000m\n\nMeteo:-  Good\n\naeroplane:- Falco\n\nSkin:-01-Malta Cr42.bmp\n\n23o Gruppo.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(Semi Historical)\n
