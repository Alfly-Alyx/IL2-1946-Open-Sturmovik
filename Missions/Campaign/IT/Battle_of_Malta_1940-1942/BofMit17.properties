Short \nCombined Axis and Italian attack on Luqa airfield\n
Description Date: 26. February 1941 - time: 13.00\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nIn Eritrea the British have taken Keren after a long and bloody battle .\n\nIn North Africa the news has been very bad indeed, the British pushed us all the way back to Beda Fomme before defeating us in depth and taking over 200,000 prisoners. \n\nTo stabilise the situation in North Africa, the Germans have sent an army commanded by a General called Irwin Rommel, he is supported by the new Italian 'Ariete' and 'Trento' motorised divisions.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nNow that the Germans have an army in North Africa the X fliegercorp has a duel role, to support 'The Africa Korp' as well as to subdue Malta. \n\nFinally German fighter formations have arrived in Sicily to support us in our attacks.\n\nThere is friction between the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica. We regard the Germans as arrogant and overbearing whilst they regard us as old fashioned and amateurish...a problem that Sicilan Commando is anxious to resolve.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nToday you will be flying a combined operation with the Luftwaffe escorting Ju87 Stuka's in a raid on Luqa airfield, approaching from the direction of North Africa. \n\n7/JG26 fly bf109 Messerschmitts so get up to speed on your aircraft recognition, they will be escorting Ju88's approaching from the direction of Sicily.\n\n7/JG26 are commanded by the German fighter ace Oberlieutenant Joachim Munchenberg.\n\nWe have instructions to adopt the 'Fliegerfier' formation of the Germans as our experience over Britain demonstrated that it is more flexible and encourages better co-operation between pilots.\n\nAltitude:- 3000m\n\nMeteo:- Fair\n\nAeroplane:- Saetta or Falco depending upon rank\n\nSkin:01-Malta MC200ser3.bmp or 01-Malta Cr42.bmp\n\n6o & 156o(new designation for 23o 'Nucleo') Gruppo's.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n
