Description Date: 07. December 1940 - time: 17.30.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nThe British have just launched a counter attack in North Africa and despite stout resistance, (General Pietro Maletti was killed while shooting at the British with his machine gun while still in pyjamas) our army is in full retreat.\n\nSeveral months ago there were rumours that our airfields in Sicily sometimes telephoned Malta to compare combat reports with the British and to date, both sides have made every effort to rescue and take care of downed and wounded aircrews.\n\nThe mood is changing and more frequent 'nasty' incidents are being reported.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nMore of our Stormos are being transferred to Africa to reinforce our army (23o Gruppo C.T.), again you wished to go with the men that you have fought with but your papers are still missing and there is no room on the transports.\n\nOn Comiso airfield your face is known and nobody doubts your courage or skill or that you should fly the fighter planes based there....away from Comiso it would seem that you still do not officially exist !\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nSCRAMBLE !\n\nEnemy bombers are attacking our airfield.\n\nAeroplane- Falco\n\nskin:- 01-Malta Cr42.bmp\n\n6o  Independant Gruppo\n\n(semi-historical)\n
