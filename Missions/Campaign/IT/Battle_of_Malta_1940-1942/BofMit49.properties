The Commando Supremo are predicting imminent surrender of Malta.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nThe remains of the British convoy are off the coast.  The 7th Cruiser Squadrons attack this morning damaged several destroyers and now that the weather has cleared we have an excellent target.\n\nYour 'holiday in Sardinia' is ended and you will fly now with some of the pilots of the 20o Gruppo who are part of the recently reformed 51o fighter Stormo.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nThis afternoon you are to escort our Ju87 Picchiatelli and S79sil Sparviero bombers in one of the attacks on the convoy.\n\nWe believe that the enemy are attempting to provide air cover by operating fighters from Malta at maximum range so there is a possibility that you may encounter some of these.\n\nWatch your fuel as this is right on the edge of your operational range\n\nAltitude:- 3900m\n\nMeteo:-Fair\n\nAeroplane:- Folgore\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC-202vii .bmp\n\n51o Stormo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n\n
