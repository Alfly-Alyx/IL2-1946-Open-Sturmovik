Short \n2nd sink the illustrious\n
Description Date: 19. January 1941 - time: 16.15\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nThe 'HMS illustrious' has been attacked continuously for the last three days yet she remains afloat.\n\nIt is almost unbelievable that a ship could survive such an attack and subject of deep embarrassment for the Regia Aeronautica and our Luftwaffe allies.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nWe have lost a lot of planes over the harbour and have not lacked courage, even if we have lacked luck.\n\nWe do not have the resources to sustain our attacks beyond today, so today we are throwing our reserves into the attack and they must be successful.\n\nThe 'illustrious' must be sunk.\n\nAlthough we are feeling the cost of these attacks we believe it has been even worse for the RAF who can be expected to launch all available fighter planes.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nYou are to provide escort to German ju87 Stuka divebombers.\n\nThe AA above the ship is ferocious so do not follow the bombers over the harbour during the final stages of their attack if you can avoid it.\n\nAltitude:- 3000m\n\nMeteo:-  Hazey\n\nAeroplane:- Saetta or Falco depending upon rank.\n\nSkin:-01-Malta MC200ser3.bmp or 01-Malta Cr42.bmp\n\n6o Independent & 23o 'Nucleo' Gruppo.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n
