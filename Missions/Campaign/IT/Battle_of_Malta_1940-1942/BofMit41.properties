Description Date: March 24th 1942  time:- 17.45 \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nYour struggles were not in vain, over the course of April 6th we dropped an estimated 300,000 kilo's of bombs on Ta Kali airfield. Enemy airpower must soon be broken.\n\nTwo days ago our battle fleet lead by the battleship 'Vittoria' engaged a British force in the Gulf of Sirte and caused it heavy damage, forcing their capital ships to turn back to Alexandria. The enemy had been attempting to escort a convoy to Malta but now the convoy is only lightly escorted by a force of destroyers.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nNews of the convoys approach reached the 13o Gruppo this morning and pilots have waited nervously all today  on the airfield for mission orders whilst groundcrews  tune and finetune the aircraft, double check ammunition and fuel loadouts and ensure your planes are in perfect readyness.\n\nSome pilots pace miles in such circumstances, others smoke like the nearby chemical factory....sensible men doze in the afternoon sunshine.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nEventualy an attack order has come through, this afternoon you are to fly close escort to a formation of S79sil Sparviero torpedo bombers in an attack against the supply convoy as it approaches Malta. Ju88's will also be attacking in coordination with you and bf109's will provide high cover.\n\nMeteo:- Good but it is not long until dusk.\n\nAeroplane:- Saetta\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC200ser3.bmp\n\n13o Gruppo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n
