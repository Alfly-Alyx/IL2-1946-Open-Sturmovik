Short Scramble, Defence of MAS flotilla\n            \n
Description Date: 2nd September 1942.   time:-  07.45       \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nIn North Africa the Folgore parachute division won glory with a spirited defence of Deir el Munassib against a strong offensive by Australian and New Zealand forces.\n\nThe Torpedo Boat 'Pegaso' sunk the British submarine 'HMS Thorn' off Tobruk. \n(Note: Pegaso has sunk 3 British submarines in 4 months.)\n\nOverall our attacks upon the convoy 'Pedestal' provided us with a great victory, however despite their losses, many of the enemy merchant ships got  to Malta and there is little chance that the island will surrender in the near future.\n\nThe Luftwaffe have transferred many bombers back to Sicily and we are increasing the intensity of our day and night bombing.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nSince the convoy there has been an increase in enemy air activity. It looks like they are bitter after loosing another carrier.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nScramble !\n\nEnemy fighter-bombers are inbound for Syracuse, flying low and very fast. \n\nBf110's are scrambling from nearby Trapani airfield.\n\nGet airborne and shoot down the enemy planes before they can cause any damage.\n\nMeteo:-  Slight mist\n\nAeroplane:- Folgore\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC202vii .bmp\n\n20o Stormo\n
