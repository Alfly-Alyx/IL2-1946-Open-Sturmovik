Description 26th June 1941 Time:05.30\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSituation:-\n\nOur night raids continue to pulverize the docks and industry around Le Valletta.\n\nThe Germans have invaded Russia.

They are assigned to Trapani airfield and have new Saetta's to fly.\n\nYou have gained a lot of experience of the Malta situation so you are to join the 10o Gruppo and give these veterans some benefit from your knowledge. It is our hope that with their aid, we may finally win total air superiority over Malta and drive the RAF from the skies.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nThis morning we have a special mission.\nOld Colonnello Ranieri Cupini is concerned about  the morale of the bomber Gruppo's, so he is going to pilot a lone S79 Sparviero reconnaissance plane over Le Valletta harbour to prove to his pilots that if a man of his age can do it, they certainly can.\n\nSaetta's of the 10o and 16o fighter Gruppo's are to fly cover. \n\nYou are flying wingman to Capitano Franco Lucchini, an ace who fought in the Spanish Civil war and is known in the Gruppo as 'Barraca della seconda guerra mondiale'.\n\nAltitude- 6500m\n\nMeteo- Slight Haze.\n\nAeroplane:- Saetta \n\nSkins:- 01-Malta MC200_III4st.bmp.\n\n10o & 16o Gruppo's, 4o Stormo.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n
