Ju87 Picchiatelli  of 97o Gruppo with the bombers of  the X Fliegercorp attacked and  damaged  the ship badly enough to force it to take shelter in Malta Harbour.\n\nMussolini and Hitler have given the order that we are now to:-\n\n\t\t\t 'Sink the Illustrious'.\n\nMission brief:-:-\n\nThroughout today we plan to launch attacks upon the ship.\n\nYou are to escort German Ju88 dive bombers in one of the attacks.\n\nExpect heavy flak over the harbour so try not to overfly it unless the bombers are directly threatened.\n\nYou will approach from the direction of the Sicilian coast, another attack group is approaching from the direction of the North African coast so do not mistake them, they have an escort of Me Bf-110's.\n\nWe expect the RAF to put everything that they have available into the air today so keep alert.\n\nAltitude:-3000m\n\nMeteo:-Fair with medium altitude cloud.\n\nAeroplane:-Saetta\n\nSkin:01-Malta MC200ser3\n\n6o Independent & 23o 'Nucleo' (the remainder not transferred to North Africa) Gruppo.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n
