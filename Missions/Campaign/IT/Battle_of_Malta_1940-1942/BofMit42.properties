Short R&R during April 1942\n            \n
Description Date: April 20th 1942  time:- 13.25 \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nOur bombing campaign is showing results. The remaining ships of the attacked convoy ran into the Malta minefield and were sunk or bombed in port later.\n\nSince then we have sunk or disabled enough warships and submarines in the port and dry-docks to force our enemy to stop using Malta harbour as a naval base. \n\nThe remaining British submarine's left Manoel Island on the 10th.\n\nThere are rumours of disunity amongst the high command. Field Marshal Kesselring and the Commando Supremo gave orders to Rommel to stop his advance so that all available resources could be put into 'Operation Hercules', Rommel went directly to Hitler and after prolonged argument 'Hercules' has been postponed.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nThroughout the last year many pilots and crews have made claims for 'Spitfires', it would appear that now our enemy really have got some in Malta. We consider it a sign of their growing desperation.\n\nThe 4o Stormo have been transferred back to Sicily to compensate for this new threat. They have refitted and now fly the Folgore mkVII with armoured glass and two additional guns in the wings.\n\nIn all likelihood you will be seeing Capitano Lucchini and Sergente Maggiore Martinoli again before long.\n\nThe 13o Gruppo has been withdrawn to wrest and re-equip before rejoining the 2o Stormo CT in Benghazi in North Africa. You sent a report reluctantly to the liaison of ItalJaeger. In it you stated that a good pilot flying an old and outdated plane should be commended for good conduct if he manages to avoid engaging a modern enemy fighter plane on disadvantageous terms'.You have not heard back.\n\n4o Stormo prepare themselves for future operations and you get a chance to take it very easy.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nYou are not excused all duties however and your Commandant calls you into his office:-\n\n   'It is Hitler's birthday today and to honour his name....and to test some new equipment, we have organised an entertainment in conjunction with the Germans.\n\n   You are to pilot one of our planes in an air race to be held against the Luftwaffe. There are going to be 4 planes in the competition, we are entering a Folgore mkVII  (which you are to fly) and an experimental plane called an RE2001 Reggiane 'Ariete' which will be flown by Sergente Maggiore Martinolo. \n  \nThe Luftwaffe are entering two BF109's but one is of a new type.\n\nThe Race will start at 13.30 (5 minutes after mission start)  exactly from above the North end of this airfield.\n\nThe course is simple,  race to the furthest promontory of Ancona harbour and back to Syracuse.\n\nNo plane is to fly above 1500 metres.\n\n\n The honour of the Regia Aeronautica is in your hands....as the RE2001, although fast, has a very temperamental engine.\n \n      Salute Pilot !'\n\nMeteo:-  Poor with dense low cloud.\n\nAeroplane:- Folgore\n\nYou must decide your racing loadout.\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC202vii.bmp\n
