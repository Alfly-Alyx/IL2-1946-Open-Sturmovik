Description Date:21st November 1941  time:- 16.45\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nAs the second winter of war approaches, shortages and rationioning are beginning to have an effect upon the spirits of the people of Sicily, many promises have been made by the political leaders and it seems that few have been kept, people were promised a swift war, glory and empire, but they have received increasing hardship and news of sons and husbands that are missing and dead. \n\nThe British counter attacked near Tobruk but swift independent action by the Italian divisions saved the Africa Korp from disaster.\n\nA German U-boat managed to torpedo a British carrier believed to be the 'Ark Royal', the carrier sunk under tow on the way back to Gibraltar.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nThe 10o Gruppo have returned to Italy to wrest and refit.The 9o and 23o Gruppo's are soon to follow.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nDespite our unrelenting night time air attacks, the British Navy have based a force of cruisers and destroyers in Malta again. We found out about this about a weak ago when this force located one of our convoys and sunk two destroyers and seven transport ships.\n\nSuch misfortune would not be possible unless the enemy felt confidant enough of their control of the air to protect their warships in Malta harbour.\n\nIt remains your task to take that control away from the RAF.\n\nThis afternoon we are taking advantage of this terrible weather and launching an attack on Hal Far Radar Station.\n\nSaetta's of the 54o Gruppo are going to attack the ground whilst the  Folgores of the 9o Gruppo provide cover.\n\nWe are going to approach very low and fast at wave top height to try and avoid detection.\n\nUpon your return you are to transfer to Gorizio in Italy for a much deserved period of wrest and recuperation with the 4o Stormo.\n\nAltitude:- 450m\n\nMeteo:-  Thunderstorms.\n\nAeroplane:-Folgior\n\nSkin:-02-Malta MC-202_III_4th Stormo.bmp\n\n9o and 54o Gruppos.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(historical)\n
