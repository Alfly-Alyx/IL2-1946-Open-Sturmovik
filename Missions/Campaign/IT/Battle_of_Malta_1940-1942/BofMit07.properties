Description Date: 24. August 1940 - time: 15.30\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nAt night time our bombers rain down huge quantities of explosives upon the port and docklands of Malta, it cannot be long before Maltese resolve is broken.\n\nThe first Squadriglie of our new German Ju87 'Picchiatelli' dive bombers are due to arrive in Sicily, they are to be part of the new 96o Gruppo. With these modern weapons we will be able to bomb targets with unbelievable precision.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nIntelligence confirms that the fighter types being flown by the RAF are 'Hurricanes' and not 'Spitfires' as most pilots keep claiming. \n\nWe have switched our daytime attacks to enemy airfields to destroy aeroplanes on the ground.\n\nYou are to continue flying with the fighter pilots of 23o Gruppo 1o Stormo C.T.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nMaggiore Luigi Filippini addresses the assembled Gruppo:-\n\n\t\t'Good afternoon gentlemen, this afternoon our mission is to escort Sparviero bombers of 192a and 193a Squadriglie,30o Stormo B.T. during an attack on Ta Kali airfield.\n\t\tStay in close formation and stay close  to the bombers,  do not get tempted to chase after enemy fighters, the British are cunning and we believe they sometimes send a few fighters to draw away the escorts so the main attacks can get to our bombers. Do not be fooled !  \n\t\tLook after your friends and I will see you all back here in time for this evenings entertainments....which I am assured include fine wines, good music and beutiful ladies !.\n\t\tDismissed.'\n\nMeteo:- Dense cloud, low cloudbase.\n\nAltitude:- 4000m    \n\naeroplane:- Falco\n\nSkin:-01-Malta Cr42.bmp\n\n23o Gruppo.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(Historical)\n
