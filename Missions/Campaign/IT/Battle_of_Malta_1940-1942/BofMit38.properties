Description Date: 7th February 1942   time:-  16.30 \n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nIn North Africa the combined Axis armies have gone on the offensive again and this time, with better tanks and aeroplanes, the outcome can hardly be in doubt, eight days ago they captured Benghazi and are pushing the enemy back to Gazala.\n\nMany of our Stormo's are still forced to fly outdated plane types despite the promises of Armaments Minister, General Priccolo Grandinetti, that production has been increased.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nThe airbase commander calls you into his office:-\n\nA Maggiore that is liaison officer with the Luftwaffe command of the ItalJaeger stands by the C/O's side. His uniform is starched and creased and his moustache is immaculately waxed, the man is obviously a political appointee and you doubt that he has ever been in a combat aeroplane in his life:-\n\n'Stand down Pilot, I have read through your record and it is....varied...you are certainly very accomplished at flying different aircraft....but do you know the minds and hearts of men ?.\n We have had some complaints from some Luftwaffe bomber crews about the willingness of the pilots of the 13o Gruppo to engage with the enemy, over the next  weeks I want you to determine the cause...and resolve the problem.\nDismissed'.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nThe warships that the Royal Navy have in Grand harbour are today's target. They could play havoc with our supply convoys again.\n\nSo the Lufwaffe are going to bomb them.\n\nYou are to fly general cover to the Ju88's whilst Jg53 109's fly close escort.\n\nAltitude:- 4000m\n\nMeteo:- Good, thin patches of high cloud  \n\nAeroplane:- Saetta\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC-200ser3.bmp\n\n13o Gruppo\n\n(airstart)\n
