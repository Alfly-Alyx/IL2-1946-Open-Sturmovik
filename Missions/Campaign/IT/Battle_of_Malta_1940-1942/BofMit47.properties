Short \n Attack on Convoy 'Harpoon'            \n
Description Date: 14th June 1942.      time:- 07.20         \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nIn North Africa our forces have won a great victory at 'The Battle of Bir Hacheim' and the British 8th army has again been beaten back, this operation was not without its problems and at one point the Deutch Africa Korp ran out of fuel and the 'Ariete' and 'Trieste' divisions had to overrun British positions to assist them.\n\nAt the beginning of June the British launched a counter offensive and the Italian X corp and Ariete Divisions put up a desperate fight and held their ground destroying many tanks.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nAfter the hard fighting of last month the 4o Stormo were given a wrest period before being sent to Martuba to renew their part in the struggle for North Africa.\n\n..... Nearly all....\n\nThe 10o Gruppo 'Autonimo' consisting of the 83a,85a and 95a squadrilie's have been posted to Sardinia to train new pilots and reach combat readyness. \n\nSardinia is within the jurisdiction of Sicilian commando and your  orders are to transfer to Sardinia to wrest and help train up this Gruppo.\n\nLife in Sardinia is a world away from the tensions of Comiso airbase, you spend your time cycling around the countryside chasing beautiful girls and occasionally giving the recruits the benefit of your combat experience. \n\nThe pilots have only very basic training in biplanes from the flight schools and have flown a few familiarisation flights in the Saetta, they are so young that it makes you feel like an old man. \n\nMission briefing:-\n\nYou manage to get away with this for about three weeks until Maggiore Gino Lodi calls you into his office:-\n\n         ' Relax pilot.....I have called you here about a very urgent matter. As you possibly know, we have managed to prevent any supplies getting to Malta since January.....\nbut now as an act of final desperation, the British  have assembled a convoy that is very heavily escorted by carriers,and warships.\nWhat has this got to do with us ?......\n...... we are the only operational fighter formation in range to escort our S79sil Sparviero bombers.\nIt is imperative that we can force the escort to break away and return to Gibraltar and then the cruiser squadron in Taranto can sortie out and finish off the job. \nWhat do you think ?....\nAre the best of our pilots up to the task of flying fighter escort ?...\nOk that's settled then. I will give you the flight plan and you can pick the most suitable pilots.\n   Do your calculations carefully because this is right on the edge of your operational range and you probably only have fuel enough for minutes over the target.\n\nOh ...and good luck !'  \n\nAltitude:- \nA flight - 5000 metre.\nB flight - 1500 metres flying close escort to the S79sil Sparviero's.\n\nMeteo:- hazy with high cloud...weather deteriorating.\n\nAeroplane:- Saetta\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC200ser3.bmp\n\n(airstart)\n\n(semi-historical)\n
