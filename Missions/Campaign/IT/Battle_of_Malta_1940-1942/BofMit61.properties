Description Date: 12th November 1942.    time:-17.45        \n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nIn North Africa our armies were forced to retreat from El Alamein after about three weeks of heavy fighting, we have few tanks or planes left to continue the struggle. The remains of our armies are retreating on foot  towards Tobruk.\n\nOf as much if not more concern is that four days ago, large mostly American armies landed in Casablanca, Oran and Algiers and will soon be in position to outflank Rommel.\n\nWith the approach of another winter, further rationing and shortages of just about everything have brought public resentment against the war simmering to the surface. It is no longer possible to walk around a village or town without witnessing this, often huge public disagreements break out between 'Nationalists' and 'Dissenters' and these sometimes turn into violent confrontations.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nLast month the Axis air forces lost over 300 planes attacking Malta, losses which are not sustainable and as a result today maybe one of the last daylight operation over the island.\n\nAfter today the fighter Gruppo's are being withdrawn to Italy to wrest and refit.\n\nDue to the continued shortfall in Macchi production,some of the 20o Gruppo are flying 'loaned' bf109's.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nTwo enemy cruisers ran supplies into Malta this morning, we intend to sink them before they can be unloaded.\n\nFighters of the 20o Gruppo are to escort Luftwaffe Ju 88's of the I/KG54 as they attack the cruisers in Le Valletta harbour.\n\nbf109's of 20o Gruppo are providing high cover.\n\nThis may be one of the last operations that we fly over Malta under present circumstances so do not take any risks.\n\nAltitude:- \nClose escort 5000 m\nHigh cover 8500 m\n\nMeteo:-  Heavy Cloud.\n\nAeroplane:- Folgore  or  bf109 depending upon rank.\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta MC202vii .bmp or 01-MaltaItalianBf109f.bmp\n\n20o Gruppo\n\n(airstart)\n
