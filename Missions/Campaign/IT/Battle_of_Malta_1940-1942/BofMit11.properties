Damage was severe. \n\n(although the Regia Marina will not give too many details).\n\nUnofficial communications with pilots fighting in Greece are not very good, the army has bogged down in the winter high passes and the Greeks fight like lions, with the help of the RAF they have pushed us back into Albania.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nThere is still no sign of your unit assignment papers, the 6o Gruppo are enjoying a brief wrest so you are to rejoin the 23o Gruppo.\n\nDue to production shortfalls, the Falco is required to remain  a front line aeroplane despite promises that you will all be flying Saetta's by the end of the year.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nToday you are to escort Sparviero bombers making a high altitude attack on Ta Kali airfield. \n\nYou are to fly close escort with the 75a and 76a squadriglie of the 23o Gruppo.\n\nAltitude:- 5000m\n\nMeteo:- Misty\n\nAeroplane:- Falco\n\nSkin:-01-Malta Cr42.bmp\n\n23o Gruppo.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(Historical)\n
