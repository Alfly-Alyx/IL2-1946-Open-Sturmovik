Short \nFighter sweep to cover attack on Kalafrana seaplane base\n
Description Date: 11. May 1941 - time: 06.00\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nLast month the 'Africa Korp' attacked and drove the British all the way back into Egypt. Tobruk is still holding out but it cannot resist us for long.\n\nEvery effort is being made to increase our industrial production of fighters and Alfa Romeo are developing a new engine (based on a Daimler-Benz) to power the next generation of Macchi, development reports about this project are very promising.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nWe have received reinforcements of planes and spare parts so we are again able to put Saetta's into the air above Malta in strength.\n\nThe conditions have been ideal for the vineyards of the region and everyone predicts a bumper harvest, this certainly has cheared up most of the pilots of the 6o Gruppo as they have friends or family that are reliant upon the crop.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nIt is not the first time that you have to get out of bed at 4am in the morning...and it hopefully won't be the last.\n\nThe Commander of 6o Gruppo, Maggiore Bruno Brambilla will be leading the attack and gives the brief:-\n\n\t\t'Fellow Sicilians.....and  others....the top brass are requesting an operation with results that they can print to impress their political superiors, and as usual we are the ones that have to provide these results.\n\t\tSo I am going to follow a tried and tested formula and we are going to attack the 'flying trams' (Short Sunderlands) at anchor at Kalafrana seaplane base. Our Falco's  will bomb the 'Flying trams' whilst Saetta's  fly cover. \n\t\tWatch out for each other today, and do not loiter after we have accomplished our objectives. The British seem to be able to put up a lot of their Hurricanes....and the longer we remain over Malta, the worse our situation will become.\n\t\tGood luck my friends, If all goes well we will speak of this day for many years to come....perhaps even tell the story to our children, or theirs....\n\t\tDismissed'\n\nMeteo:- good\n\nAeroplane:- Saetta or Falco depending upon rank\n\nSkin:01-Malta MC200ser3.bmp or 01-Malta Cr42.bmp\n\n6o Independant Gruppo\n\n(airstart)\n
