Short \n Recon escort over Malta Harbour.\n
Description 22nd October 1941 Time:14.00\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSituation:-\n\nWe continue to bomb Malta during most nights.\n\nIn North Africa, Tobruk has been under siege for some months, it cannot hold out against us for much longer.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nNow that the 4o Stormo have settled into their quarters it is time for us to go onto the offensive.\n\nIt brings you much joy that Capitano Franco Lucchini is back and that you will be flying with the Veterans of the 9o and 10o Gruppo's again. The Capitano has so far destroyed 14 enemy aircraft shared and 16 more probables and has been made commander of the 84a Squadriglie. For this he was awarded with another Medaglia d'argento al valore militare. Well deserved 'Barraca della seconda guerra mondiale'.\n\nAnother Pilot of the Stormo, Sergente Teresio Martinoli has also scored a lot of kills and flies with superlative skill.\n\nMission briefing:-\n\nCapitano Lucchini looks very young, almost baby faced, you gather near as he speaks in a quiet voice:-\n\n'Well my friends, It is good to see that you are all ok after the recent incident with dirty aviation fuel, from now on all fuel is to be filtered on the field before it is put into any of our plane's, on my orders.\n\nToday some military genius has come up with a plan and we are again going to strafe Ta Kali airfield.\n\nThis should be a good chance for us to see what the new Folgore can really do.\n\nThe approach is going to be at high speed and with luck, we can hit the field and be gone before the RAF can get organised.\n\nDrop down and strafe the airfield if the situation presents itself but be wary as there are not a lot of us. The Folgore climbs like a devil so if you get into trouble think about climbing out of difficulty rather than turning. Good luck all of you....and when we get back we shall try and survive an evening of celebration in Syracuse...Mussolini is paying !'\n\nToday you will be flying with Sergente Teresio Martinoli whilst Capitano Franco Lucchini leads the mission. \n(Rank will define who is the wingman)\n\nMeteo- Hazy with low cloud.\n\nAeroplane:- Folgore\n\nSkins:- 02-Malta MC-202_III_4th Stormo.bmp\n\n9o & 10o Gruppo 4o Stormo.\n\n(airstart)\n\n(historical)\n
