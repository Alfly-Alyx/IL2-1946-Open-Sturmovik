Description Date: 9th May 1942.     time:- 17.45        \n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nWe have had considerable success against enemy submarines lately sinking the famous 'HMS Upholder' on the 14th of last month, although we also lost the cruiser 'Giovani Delle Bande' earlier this month to a submarine.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nYou spend a quiet afternoon relaxing with Sergente Maggiore Teresio Vittorio Martinoli. He was a reservist like yourself and does not display much enthusiasm for this conflict or your political masters. He tells you that early in the war he transferred from fighters to fly the glamorous (so he thought) Ju87 Picchiatelli....18 hours in a life raft soon taught him the error of his ways and he transferred straight back to flying fighters. Since then he has proved himself one of Italy's very best fighter pilots.\n\nWith Malta port put out of action as a naval base, and the return to Sicily of the veterans of the 4o Stormo, the Regia Aeronautica and the Luftwaffe Command  (ItalJaeger)  have decided to make a concerted effort to win complete air superiority so that no one can again overrule operation 'Hercules'.\n\nYou are to fly today with Capitano Frank Lucchini and Sergente Maggiore Teresio Vittorio Martinoli  and 9o and 10o Gruppo's.\n\nMission Briefing:-\n\nThe 4o Stormo commander, Maggiore Antonio Larsimont addresses the briefing room:-\n\n   ' Gentlemen,  Today bombers of the 210o Squadrilie B.T are going to bomb Luqa airbase on the edge of the harbour from about 5000 metres. As they will be likely to miss everything, it is down to you to destroy the enemy  in the air !.\n    The 10o Gruppo are to provide the top cover. The 9o Gruppo close escort,  Stay vigilant because you will undoubtedly be facing enemy 'Spitfires'.\n   Capitano Frank Lucchini is leading this mission so you are flying with the best.\nFollow his orders and I will see you all this evening for dinner. We have a particularly good Chianti to go with the meal.'\n\n9o Gruppo are providing close escort to the bombers,you are flying with Sergente Maggiore Martinoli.\n\nAltitude:- 5200m\n\nMeteo:-  Fair visibility, high cloud\n\nAeroplane:-  Folgore\n\nSkin:- 03-Malta MC-202_VII_Dark4th Stormo.bmp\n\n9o,10o Gruppo's 4o Stormo\n\n(airstart)\n\n(Historical)\n
