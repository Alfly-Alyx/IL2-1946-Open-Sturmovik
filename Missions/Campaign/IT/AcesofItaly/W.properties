Description \n\nNorthern Italy\nFebruary 1945\n\nFuel shortages have led to a dramatic reduction in the availability of Italian fighters for operations since the beginning of the new year. The imbalance of forces has, of course, long reached ridiculous levels.  Allied air forces outnumber us to the point were all we can really do is launch the occasional guerrilla attack against the streams of enemy bombers and fighters. Our flak is probably of far greater concern to them, especially to their ground attack pilots who have suffered terrible losses to the deadly German 3.7 and 8.8 centimetre guns.\n\nThe weather has also curtailed flying operations but of course that affects both sides so it's not always a bad thing.  For most of January our unit was grounded by the weather, with a break of a few days toward the end of the month.  Just long enough for us to lose a couple of good, experienced pilots.\n\nThe only good thing that has happened has been the arrival of the Me109G6-AS and the G-10 to replace our old, worn out G6's.\n\n'Suddenly, alerted by the radio, I saw an aircraft higher than me, 300m away, turning and diving slightly as if to attack me.  I waggled my wings again to try and confuse him and closed my throttle...in a second I was on his tail, fired a burst and saw something fly off. I had hit him!  A second burst with the cannon shot away one wing.' \nCombat report of Serg. Gaulberto Benzi, 1945.\n\n
