Description \nSicily\nFebruary 1942\n\nYou are flying a routine patrol over the Mediterranean when you come into contact with a British Short Sunderland flying boat.  The Sunderland is heavily armed and notoriously tough to shoot down.  On one occassion one of these 'flying porcupines' was engaged by a patrol of 6 German Junkers 88 long range fighters and shot down 1 of them and damaged the others before driving them off and returning to its' own base.\n\nThis calls for good tactics and teamwork if everyone is going to get home safely.  There are 4 Macchis in the flight, attacks must be coordinated to split the enemy gunner's defensive fire.\n\nLet's get him!\n\n
