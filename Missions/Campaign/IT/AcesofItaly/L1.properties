Name Night raid
Short \nSicily\nJune 1943\nRAF night bombers are attacking the Italian mainland\n
Description \n\nSicily\nJune 1943\n\nRAF Stirling heavy bombers have been attacking towns on the mainland and are now returning in dribs and drabs towards Egypt.  Several of them have flown almost directly overhead, their droning and the muffled crump of the anti aircraft guns lending a strangely surreal atmosphere to the Mediterranean night.\n\nThere is a Macchi fuelled and armed at dispersal ready for an early morning mission, you decide to seek permission to take off and try to hunt one of the stragglers.  Permission is granted finally, although little good has come of these nocturnal adventures by day fighters before.  Nevertheless, as you watch the searchlights probe far out across the sea and into the clouds, you can't help feeling a strange sense of elation, that a gambler's luck is on your side.\n\n\n'Whatever be the lengths to which others may go, His Majesty's government will never resort to the deliberate attack on women and children, and other civilians for purposes of mere terrorism.'  Neville Chamberlain, 1939.\n\n
