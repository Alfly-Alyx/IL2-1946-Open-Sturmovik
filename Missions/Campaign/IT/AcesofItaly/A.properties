Name 'When the cannon sound everything will fall into place.'
Short \nJune 1940\nA fighter patrol over Southern France\n
Description \nThe French campaign\nJune 1940\n\nIl Duce has decided that the time is now right to enter the war with Germany against the British and the French.  The French government have already begun asking for an armistice and the British will probably sue for peace once France is out of the war.\n\nWe have been flying a series of patrols over Provence in our CR42s, lending indirect support to the Savoia bombers.  Already we have had several encounters with the French air force but so far the results have been inconclusive although the French fly very aggressively and they have fast, modern, well armed fighters which are more than equal to our CR42s.\n\nCiano: 'I expect you know why you have been called?'\nFrancois-Poncet: 'I am not too bright, but this time I have not misread the situation.'\n\n\n\n\n
