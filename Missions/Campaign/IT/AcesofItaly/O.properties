Description \nCentral Italy\nJanuary 1944\n\nFollowing the allied landings in September last year, Italy has been split in two with the southern half of the country under allied occupation and accepting co-belligerent status against the axis. \n\nIn the North of the country we have had to organise new armed forces to fight alongside the Germans for the new government.  The Italian navy has simply sailed en-masse to Malta to surrender, while the army here is engaged mainly in anti partisan activities leaving the Germans to face the allied armies in central Italy. \n\nMeanwhile a new air force is slowly coming together with, so far one fighter unit formed; number 1 Gruppo Caccia.  The 3 squadriglie of this unit are equipped with Macchi 202s and have already begun operations, mainly against the American heavies flying over on their way to the Reich or to targets in Central Europe and the Balkans as well as targets in Italy itself.\n\nYou are flying a patrol on your own side of the front lines when you spot allied fighter bombers attacking friendly vehicles. Your flight is heavily outnumbered as always but there is no choice, you must engage.\n\n'It can't go on much longer.  Sicily has gone now.  The Germans will doublecross us. The discipline of the troops has broken down.'\nBenito Mussolini\n\n
