Description \nNorthern Italy\nMarch 1945\n\nToward the end of February, Maggiore Bellagambi was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class by our German colleagues.  I feel it's a bit late now for such gestures of confidence from them. 1 Gruppo Caccia is back in Italy again partly trained on the Me163 and partly on the Me109, not quite ready for operations as a result.\n\nWe have had a lot of visits from important officers in the Luftwaffe and ANR during March and bizarrely a pair of German Bucker trainers have spent some time here to put us all through an aerial gunnery course!  I'm quite sure that one day we will all look back and have a good laugh.\n\nThe ongoing cycle of victory and loss continues for our pilots.  Some losses seem more tragic than others in the telling, such as Sergente Maggiore Zerini who survived his first combat encounter with the enemy air force only to be shot down by German flak whilst returning home at low level.\n\nGerman jet aircraft based at Campoformido are being used to fly high speed reconnaissance missions over allied territory.  We have been asked to fly a patrol over the Campoformido area to protect them from fighter bomber attacks.  Capitano Drago will lead the formation.\n\n'We may be willing to give up our shirts, but the Germans remove even our hides.'\nBenito Mussolini\n\n
