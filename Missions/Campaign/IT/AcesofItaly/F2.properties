Short \nSicily\nApril 1942\nRAF bombers are attacking the Italian mainland\n
Description \n\nSicily\nApril 1942\n\nThe RAF have been able to bolster their fighter defences on Malta with the addition of Spitfires as well as more Hurricanes from the carriers Victorious and Eagle.  Now with the Americans in the war the USS Wasp has joined in the operation to maintain a strong British presence on the island. \n\nWe are continuing to attack Malta, aided now by elements of the Luftwaffe's bomber Gruppen once again.  Junkers 88s, some of them from specialised anti shipping units have been flying an aggressive series of raids against British assets on Malta.  Our brave fighter pilots are flying escort missions alongside their colleagues from the Jagdwaffe.  \n\nMartinoli, a Macchi pilot from 9 Gruppo has done particularly well against the defenders, enjoying quite a run of success during his first tour. You are at readiness this morning when an alert comes through, RAF bombers are attacking targets in Sicily from their bases in Malta. \n\n'Everyone, let's go!'\n\n'It is certain that your sacrifices will be rewarded. That is as true as it is true that God is just and that Italy is immortal.'  Benito Mussolini\n\n
