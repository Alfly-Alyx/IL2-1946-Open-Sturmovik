Description \nNorth Africa\nOctober 1942\n\nWe have been fighting some of the toughest aerial combats of the war so far trying to stem the British onslaught against our defences at El Alamein.  All through the night the battle rages on in the desert.   When we fly our patrols we can see the front line from many miles away.  A great cloud of dust and smoke rises up like a storm cloud and as we get closer we see the flashes like lightning coming from inside the storm until finally we see individual tanks crawling over the surface, their turrets swinging from side to side as they advance.  The British fighter bombers rise and fall above this hellish scene like flies, feeding on a dead horse.\n\nSuddenly we are in the midst of the battle, screaming at low level across the heads of two armies merged in confusion.  We fan out and glance quickly around without stopping for a second, each of us seeking a target among the many Kittyhawks that flash past like red and yellow rockets.  \n\n
