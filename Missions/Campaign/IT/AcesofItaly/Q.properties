Name Liberators
Short Intercept a raid by American 4 engined heavies\n
Description \nNorthern Italy\nMay 1944\n\nWe are seeing a lot of action flying the Macchi 205 Veltro fighter. Italian cities in the North are still being bombed by the Americans and the British.  We fighter pilots have had to make some tough decisions about where our allegiances lie, but for now we have no choice in our hearts but to defend those ancient towns and cities and their populations from the mass bombing raids. \n\nRelations with the Germans have become strained and partisan activity by our own countrymen is on the increase and making life difficult off the base. There have been instances of Italian personnel being kidnapped or murdered by Italians.  Theft and banditry are becoming rife in this part of the country. Given their reputation in such matters I don't think the Germans will put up with it for long before they start making examples and replying in kind.\n\nFormations of American four engined Liberator bombers with escorts have been plotted heading toward our area of operations. Gain as much height as you can quickly and steer 200 degrees to intercept them.\n\n'The Germans are hard task masters.  You too will learn this'\nFrancois-Poncet, French ambassador to Italy, June 1940\n\n\n
