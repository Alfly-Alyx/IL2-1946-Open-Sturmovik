Name The straits of Messina
Short Defend Sicily from allied attack\n
Description \nSicily\nJune 1943\n\nThe final collapse in Tunisia was a disaster for Italy and Germany.  We lost quarter of a million tough and experienced soldiers and a great deal of precious equipment. Now the allies are undoubtedly preparing their next invasion and the likely choice would appear to be Sicily judging by the concentrated air attacks we have experienced.  Our airfields are being bombed from end to end by British and American medium bombers and strafed repeatedly by fighters. A German Me109 Geschwader, JG77, led by Steinhoff is also on Sicily to help strengthen our air defence.  After the decimation we suffered in Tunisia, we certainly need it. \n\nWe are taking off in a few minutes on another patrol along the coast.  You prepare for the flight, donning your lifejacket and other survival equipment. Too many good friends have been lost after baling out, it doesn't pay in such dangerous times not to be careful.\n\n'You have imposed a dictatorship on Italy which is historically immoral.  You have destroyed the spirit of our armed forces. For years when selecting someone from among several candidates for an important post, you have invariably selected the worst.'  \nCount Dino Grandi addressing Mussolini in front of the Italian Government in 1943\n\n\n
