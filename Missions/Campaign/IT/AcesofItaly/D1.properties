Description \nGreece\nApril 1941\n\nThe Winter here in Albania has been long and bloody.  Many of our friends have died in this exceptionally tough campaign and others have been injured or captured.  Most of us never want to see this part of Europe again when we leave... if we leave.  In March we launched a series of counteroffensives against Greek forces which, although they appeared to gain little territory, certainly sapped the strength of the Greek army.\n\nOn every front the war has not been going well for Italy.  In Libya, the British have enjoyed a succesful counter attack against Marshall Grazianis forces. However with an influx of German troops and equipment we have been able to reverse this catastrophe and now we have recovered all of the lost territory.  The Royal Navy have followed up their daring and successful attack by Swordfish torpedo bombers at Taranto with a further naval success at the battle of Matapan, south of Greece in which we lost 3 modern cruisers and 2 destroyers.\n\nMeanwhile the situation in East Africa grows worse despite early triumphs in British Somaliland.  The problem there is that it is difficult to get any supplies through to our forces and so our early capture of British held territory has turned into a retreat from  counter attacks by Commonwealth troops from Kenya.  In truth it is not known how much longer our army in Ethiopia can hold out now that they are to all intents and purposes under siege.\n\nGerman help has become our most precious commodity in this war as we have quickly discovered in Cyrenaica.  If the truth be told, we were quite unprepared for a prolonged war against serious adversaries such as the British Empire.  Now once again our friends in Germany have come to our assistance, this time here in the Balkans.  On April 6th German, Hungarian and Italian forces attacked Yugoslavia following a military takeover of the Government in that country.  A few weeks earlier the Yugoslavians had signed a treaty with the axis only for it to be torn up and thrown back at us by the rebels.  When they signed a new treaty with the Soviet Union something had to be done and so the invasion was forced upon us by circumstances.  By April 17th the Yugoslavian army had surrendered and German forces were already driving deep into Northern Greece alongside our Italian divisions.\n\nNow after a fortnight of heavy fighting resistance is crumbling and the occupation of Athens is perhaps only a few more days away.  Signs of yet another  British evacuation are already apparent.\n\nThe enemy are dug in around the narrow passes at Thermopylae and a full scale artillery duel has broken out there between determined Australian forces and the Germans.  It is vital that we continue to mount attacks from the air in order to force an enemy retreat at this strategically important juncture.\n\n'Nineteen tanks in file charge along the road...on our right the hills, on our left the dreaded Thermopylae swamp.  suddenly we came under fire from 6 or 8 guns...shells burst on all sides, a few Tommies ran across the road, and several machine guns chattered. A heavy tank was hit direct...in the middle of the road are 3 others on fire...before long there was not a single tank in going order and only 2 still able to shoot.'\nBattle report I/XXXI Panzer.\n\n\n\n
