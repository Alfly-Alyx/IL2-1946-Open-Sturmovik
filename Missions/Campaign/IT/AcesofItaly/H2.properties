Description \nNorth Africa\nDecember 1942\n\nLast month in the wake of our defeat at Alamein, an Anglo-American force landed in the Vichy French territories of North West Africa, giving us the added headache of fighting on two fronts in this theatre.  On the plus side, we were able to establish a base in Tunisia with strong reinforcements brought in.  This has greatly shortened our supply lines and brought us closer to Sicily.  We have also taught the Americans a few hard facts about warfare and if only we had had enough immediate reserves available we could have thrown them right back into the sea. \n\nThe 8th army continue to press Westwards however, and the ports of Tobruk and Benghazi are already back in British hands.  The German and Italian armies are dug in at El Agheila and prepared for a confrontation with the pursuing 8th army.  A battle for the Libyan capital of Tripoli now seems the next likely event in Africa.\n\nAmerican air power is beginning to make its presence felt here also, alongside the familiar RAF types.  B24 Liberators and B25 Mitchells are regularly encountered by our pilots along with American Airacobra, Lightning and Warhawk fighter bombers.\n\nWe are running up our engines ready for another patrol to cover our armour from air attack.  Clouds of dust billow up and around us as the propellors kick into life and our streamlined fighters manouevre for position on the runway.  They remind me of greyhounds with their sleek, aggressive lines.  Worn out by the desert war, but still handsome, purposeful machines.\n\n\n'Down with Mussolini, who murdered the Alpini'-Italian world war 2 infantry song\n\n\n
