Description \n2 Gruppo Caccia\nNorthern Italy\nJuly 1944\n\nAlthough the allied advance appears to have slowed, enemy fighter bombers and tactical bombers are attacking and attempting to destroy all of  our bridges across the River Po in order to isolate the battlefield.  2 Gruppo is not in any great condition for operations but under the circumstancdes we have to fly them nevertheless.  This month got off to a good start with an American P47 destroyed in air combat before we transferred to our new base at Villafranca de Verona.\n\nAlert! American twin engine bombers with escorts are heading in toward our sector.\n\n'Toward the end of 1943 at the latest, it had become unmistakably clear that the war was militarily lost.' General Halder\n\n
