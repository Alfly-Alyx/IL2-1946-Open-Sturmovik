Name Maltal Reconnaissance
Short A reconnaissance flight over the enemy base at Malta\n
Description \nSicily\nOctober 1941\n\nOne of the Macchis has been fitted with cameras for the fighter reconnaissance role over Malta.  Despite the dangers inherent in this type of mission there is never a shortage of volunteers to fly this aircraft.  This evening you have been selected to fly a fast photographic sortie over the enemy bases on the Islands.  You have been briefed on the targets and their defences (not that you need telling) and now you are strapped in and ready to take off.\n\nYou can definitely expect heavy flak during your circuit of the target area and there is usually some attempt made by the RAF fighters to intercept these flights so you must stay alert the whole time.  Keep your speed up and don't get taken by surprise, that will be your best defence.\n\nGood luck Senori, and god speed your return.\n\n\n
