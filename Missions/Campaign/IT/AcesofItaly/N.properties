Short Low level fight with American P47s\n
Description \nMainland Italy\nAugust 1943\n\nThe allied invasion of Sicily, although fiercely resisted was impossible to stop with the resources available to us.  Every airfield in every corner of the island was carpet bombed by American heavies and by the British and American medium bombers and fighter-bombers.  Local air strength was practically wiped out within the first few days of the attack until we had no choice but to remove the survivors back across the Straits of Messina.\n\nNow the allies have switched their bombing offensive to the mainland and one town after another has been subjected to the full fury of modern air power.  While the heavily escorted bombers go about their work on our civilian and industrial centres their low level fighter bombers range far and wide across the country attacking everything.  Our fighter squadrons, severely mauled in recent battles are doing their best to cope and we are taking a steady toll of the enemy.  Flak defences have also proven deadly to the allied air forces but none of it is enough and daily we are forced to meet superior enemy formations.\n\nWe are going to fly one of our many  patrols over the coast between Palmi and Pizzo.  Remain vigilante, there are bound to be enemy aircraft around somewhere.  There always are.\n\n'Even when the issue of the war became certain, Mussolini would have been welcomed by the allies.'\nWinston Churchill\n\n\n
