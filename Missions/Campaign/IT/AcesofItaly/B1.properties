Description \nItalian Cyrenaica\nSeptember 1940\n\nWe continue to patrol the Libyan skies in preparation for Grazianis offensive against the British in Egypt.  These flights are mostly uneventful although sometimes we run into a British patrol or perhaps a single reconnaissance aircraft which has strayed too far over Cyrenaica.\n\nWe line up once again on what passes for a runway on this small desert airstrip.  The smell of the Mediterranean brine is faintly recognisable but is soon replaced by the smell of burning fuel as one engine after another coughs and barks into vibrant life.  It is 0900 in the Morning and already the sun is beginning to bake the surface of everything that it touches. \n\nThe squadriglia of Fiat biplanes leave the dusty earth one by one and set course Eastwards after their leader.\n\n'You cannot break armour with fingernails'\nMarshall Graziani\n\n
