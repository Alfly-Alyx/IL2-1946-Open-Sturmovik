Name Malta Sweep
Short \nAn evening sweep over Malta\n
Description \nThe aerial campaign against Malta\nAugust 1941\n\nThe bombing campaign against Malta continues day after day, from first light til last.  The Wellingtons and Beaufighters operating from it's airfields, not to mention the destroyers based there have been wreaking havoc with our shipping in the Mediterranean.  There is always something going on for us, whether it's a bomber or reconnaissance escort or a fighter sweep, we are kept busy here in Sicily.\n\nAlready today our squadriglia has taken part in two raids on the island and now as the sun begins to set below the calm Mediterranean sea we stroll out toward our fighters to fly over the enemy stronghold one more time.\n\nWe walk unhurried from the dispersal toward our Macchis scattered around the field.  Birds are singing softly in our ears from nearby bushes and flies dance lazily in the fading sunlight. The voices of our ground crews carry easily on the still air. \n\nPerhaps some of the others are wondering if this is the last time they will hear a bird singing or feel friendly earth beneath their feet.\n\nYou climb onto the wing, exchanging a wan smile with your groundcrew, and soon you are being strapped in tightly to your machine, the sadness of the twilight already fading from your thoughts.\n\n\n'sacrifice every interest, except only the defence and feeding of this island', Winston Churchill.\n\n
