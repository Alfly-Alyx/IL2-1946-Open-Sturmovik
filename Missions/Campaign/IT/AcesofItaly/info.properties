Name Aces of the Italian Empire
Short \n
Description A semi-historical career for the Italian fighter pilot. The period covered is from June 1940 through until April 1945. Obviously a front line fighter pilot would fly many more sorties than this, (I've included 45), over such a long period, but look on it as including only those which were particularly note worthy for one reason or another and forget about the less interesting ones. Suggested difficulty settings are full hard, but leave externals on if you would like to watch other actions take place around you. I have chosen to avoid specific mission goals because I think it is better just to read the briefing, fly the waypoints and do your best so for that reason I suggest that you disable the button for 'No Instant Success'. It doesn't mean you will always be succesful but it means that you don't have to refly missions until you score the appropriate points before you can move on. Any problems with the campaign, or if you just want to discuss it please feel free to e-mail me at EAF602WHIZZ@aol.com.
