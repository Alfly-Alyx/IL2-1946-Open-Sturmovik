Description \nNorthern Italy\nDecember 1944\n\nUgo Drago has been promoted to Capitano, a well earned promotion for a fearless and  successful pilot.  2 Gruppo has had more encounters with American B26s which have led to some successes against the twin engined bombers but also, inevitably have brought us some painful losses too. \n\nMustangs and Thunderbolts have been making strafing attacks on our airfield and a few days ago as we lined up for take off a pair of P47s came screaming in at very low level for a strafing run.  Fortunately we avoided catastrophe and even managed to shoot down one of the opportunists who unwisely hung around too long.\n\nWe are embarking on a midday patrol led by Capitano Drago.  There are reports of Flying Fortresses in the area with P51 escorts, so we are anxiously looking around for signs of the enemy formations as we form up and begin our climb to our patrol area.\n\n'Hitler and I have surrendered ourselves to our illusions like a couple of lunatics.  We have only one hope left; to create a myth.'\nBenito Mussolini\n\n\n
