Short Patrol the desert airspace in the Macchi 202\n
Description \nNorth Africa\nAugust 1942\n\nWelcome back to the North African front.  Our forces led by Rommel have made dramatic progress across the desert pushing the allies far back into Egypt.  In June the port of Tobruk was captured and the enemy have been pushed all the way back to El Alamein, which is less than 100 kilometres from Alexandria. The decisive battle in this theatre is not far off now and the signs are good. Rommel must soon launch another large scale assault on the British defences, having failed to break through on the first attempt.\n\nYou're Squadriglia has been re-equipped with the Macchi 202 'Folgore', a very sleek and fast fighter with an inline engine which is popular with its pilots.\n\nEnemy air power in this theatre is increasing and their equipment is also gradually getting better.  The RAF are using Kittyhawks and have begun to introduce Spitfires to this front. They are also using more modern bombers to replace the Blenheims and Martin Marylands. American air forces are also arriving in theatre including some 4 engined heavy bombers.\n\n'It is not gunfire I hear, but a hunting horn'\nKeith Douglas\n\n
