Description \nNorth Africa\nSeptember 1942\n\nThe RAF have made heavy use of their Kittyhawk and Hurricane fighter bombers to attack our lines of communications and supply during our recent advances into Egypt. Everything that moves along the coastal road is open to interdiction by the British fighters from solitary trucks to well protected motorised columns.  Their successes however have cost them dearly in terms of aircraft shot down.  The MC202 and its German counterpart the Me109F are superior in most respects to the British aircraft.  Because of this and a shortage of experienced British pilots we have been able to maintain the upper hand in the air fighting.\n\nDespite this the RAF continue with determination and aggression to hit targets in the rear areas such as supply dumps, tank parks, coastal shipping and even our own airfields.  Their numbers are growing steadily and disproportionately to our own until now it is difficult to intercept their light tactical bomber formations (Douglas Bostons mainly) without becoming embroiled in heavy skirmishing with the escorts.\n\nIn short then, we are beginning to feel outnumbered and it seems that no amount of superior equipment or skill can redress that effectively.\n\nAt the end of August Feldmarschall Rommel launched a major assault on the British 8th army in an attempt to break through at last to the Nile delta and bring the Mediterranean war to an end.  The ensuing battle fought at Alam El Halfa was bitterly contested by both sides.  However in the face of heavy resistance from well dug in ground troops and overwhelming air attack from RAF fighter formations the attack failed and Rommel was forced to withdraw for a rethink on his offensive.  Fuel shortage was perhaps his most critical consideration at this stage with many axis ships being sunk enroute to North Africa.\n\nIt is dusk on September 7th 1942 and allied fighters continue to attack and harrass the axis forces withdrawing from the minefields around Alam El Halfa.  Our Macchis are preparing for a patrol over the area to hunt for the enemy air force.\n\n'In many respects this little known battle was the climax of army/air cooperation in the Western Desert.  The battle was a classic of its kind, exemplifying the use of air power....when used in direct support of an army in the field.'\nJohn Terraine, 'The Right of the Line'\n\n\n
