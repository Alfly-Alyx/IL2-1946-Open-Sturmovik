Name Greek Winter
Short \nGreece 1941\nA patrol in poor weather over the Italian-Greek lines\n
Description \nAlbanian-Greek front\nFebruary 1941\n\nThe campaign to conquer Greece has been little short of disastrous.  The Anglo-Greek armed forces have caused heavy casualties among our ground troops and the supply situation is far from good with our main sea ports in Albania under threat of occupation. In the air the RAF and the Greek air force continue to patrol aggressively over our territory with their Gladiators.  Hawker Hurricanes have also begun to appear in theatre to cause us even more problems.\n\n Despite the attrocious weather we have to continue flying to help our soldiers on the ground.  The enemy are flying in spite of it and their armies are gaining ground every day.\n\nWe are going to fly a dangerous patrol through the mountains across the  front lines to give moral support to our troops.  Perhaps we can even do something practical while we're up there if the enemy are flying today in this soup.  The real danger though will be from the low cloud cloaking the hillsides.  Stay vigilant and fly carefully at all times, there's nothing glorious about a pointless death on a mountain slope in some foreign country.\n\n'From today onwards we are all Italians and nothing but Italians.  Now that steel has to meet steel, one single cry comes from our hearts-Viva l'Italia!'\nMussolini\n\n
