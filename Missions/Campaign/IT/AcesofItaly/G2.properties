Description \nWestern Desert\nSeptember 1942\n\nFollowing the 'six day race' at the beginning of this month and our failure to break through the British lines, Rommel has decided that rather than retreat, the axis will dig in here and await the enemy assault.  In recent weeks we have been building up our defence with wire, tank trap and mine and prepared positions from which to take on the Tommies.\n\nMuch of this preparation for a renewed battle depends on the flow of supplies to the front line and as always the RAF have been keeping busy with their harrassing tactics both on land and at sea.  The fighter bombers, medium bombers and anti shipping aircraft have to be kept in check although we have scarce aircraft with which to do it.\n\nNevertheless, to this end we are flying daily patrols from Dawn until Dusk and our successes are mounting steadily against the Kittyhawks and Hurricanes.\n\nWe are taking off on our first patrol of the day shortly to cover the main coast road.  The boys on the ground are always glad to see us, but you have to forgive them if their fingers are a little itchy on the trigger these days.\n\n\n
