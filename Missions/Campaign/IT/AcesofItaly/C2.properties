Short \nGreece1940/41\nScramble to intercept a british air raid\n
Description \nAlbania\nJanuary 1941\n\nIt pains me to admit it but the attack against Greece has been as poorly executed as every other undertaking by Italians in this war so far.  Noone can blame the poor Italian soldiers who bleed to death every day in the snow.  The fault lies with the generals who are responsible for equipping and directing the efforts of the fighting men.  It is dangerous to say it out loud in company but corruption must go all the way to the top or at least as far as the highest ranking officers.\n\nThis was underscored at the beginning of this month when Marshall Badoglio and Admiral Cavagnari both resigned.  Hopefully things will begin to improve with some fresh ideas at the top of the command chain.\n\nAt the end of November the Greeks continued their advance into Albania and captured Koritsa defeating our crack IXth mechanised division.  The Alpini troops have also suffered badly with heavy casualties incurred against the Greek Evzone Regiments at Vovousa.  Pressure from the Greek and British armies has scarcely let up since the beginning of November.\n\nIn the air we face a skilful and determined Royal Air Force along with equally determined Greek pilots.  Losses in the air have been heavy despite the occasional victory.  \n\nAn enemy air attack has been spotted coming in by observers on the ground,  get into the air quickly or they'll have us all on a plate.\n\nWherefore rejoice? What conquests brings he home?\nWhat tributaries follow him to Rome, to grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?\nJulius Caesar, Act 1\n\n\n
