Name Convoy patrol
Short \nProtect a convoy from allied air attack with the Macchi 200\n
Description \nSicily\nNovember 1941\n\nA convoy of vital materials for the war effort is enroute to Libya to help counter the latest enemy offensive in North Africa, 'operation crusader'.  A British flying boat which was shadowing the convoy was chased away earlier today and there have also been submarine sightings.  An attack by RAF torpedo bombers flying out of Malta is guaranteed to be imminent and everyone on those ships will be feeling edgy. \n\nBe on the alert, we can't afford to lose any of those supply ships.  The British aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was finally sunk a few days ago during one of it's Hurricane deliveries to Malta.  This is the best news we've heard in a while and should help tip the balance a little bit in the Mediterranean.  Nevertheless Malta's value as a base of offensive naval and air operations is clearer than ever now that our army in Libya is being forced back by the British attack.\n\n'The Fuhrer wanted me to be examined by his own doctor. I refused. I've already diagnosed my illness myself. It's called "convoys".' Benito Mussolini\n\n\n
