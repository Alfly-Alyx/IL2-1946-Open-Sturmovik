Name Ground strafing over France
Short Ground attack on a French airfield\n
Description \nThe campaign against France\nJune 1940\n\nWith their allies either defeated or abandoning them to their fate, and their armed forces surrendering before the avalanche of the German and Italian armies, the French government are on the brink of collapse.  \n\nIt seems as if the war against Britain and France is drawing to a close and we can soon enjoy peace and the spoils of a short, victorious war.  A new Roman Empire will be built at the expense of the old British and French Empires, for how else are great civilisations created other than by conquest?\n\nOur air force continues to apply pressure on the French while our brave Alpini troops battle their way through narrow mountain passes into France itself.  We have been flying a number of close support, ground strafing sorties against enemy positions in the past few days.  This afternoon we are tasked with an attack on a French airfield which is being used by several of their fighter squadrons.\n\nWe take off on this sortie at 1300hrs. France may be finished, but from our vantage point the French air force is showing no signs of lying down.  Whenever we encounter enemy aircraft their pilots appear eager to join combat, often to our disadvangage.\n\n'I can tell you that everything will be over by September and that I only need a few thousand dead so that I can sit at the peace conference as a man who has fought.'\nBenito Mussolini, May 1940\n\n
