Name March 1944
Short Another large American raid is heading South after bombing targets in central Europe.\n
Description \nCampoformido, Italy\nMarch 1944\n\nAmerican heavy bombers are returning from a raid over Germany and they are heading this way enroute to their bases in the South.  Our pilots have seen a lot of action in the past few months, principally against the American heavies flying to and from targets in Germany or other axis targets.  Enemy fighter bombers are also becoming an ever greater cause for concern. Thunderbolts and other types are hunting in packs at lower altitudes far inside our territory causing havoc with our road and railway traffic.\n\nThe war grinds on and on, never satisfied with the lives already claimed or ruined forever.  I wonder how many of us care now about the 'new Roman empire' or even care who wins the final battles.  We all just want the bombing and the killing to stop.  Now Italy is the scene of a civil war, two countries fighting for opposing ideals.  Here in the Northern half of the country, the partisans, communists in fact, are becoming bolder and incidents of sabotage, kidnapping, murder and blackmail are becoming part of the background to our lives. \n\nAnd yet we are all still Italians and someday soon we will have to work together to rebuild our country, whatever flag is flying over our heads.  The Winter is behind us, who knows what this Summer of 1944 will bring.\n\n'It is probable that the personnel consist of either the few remaining fanatical Fascist elements or...personnel pressed into service by threats of reprisals.  These should not prove very satisfactory material for the building up of an air force.' \nAllied intelligence report, March 1944.\n\n
