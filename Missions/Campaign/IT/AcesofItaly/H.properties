Name El Alamein
Short the battle of El Alamein\n
Description \nNorth Africa\nOctober 1942\n\nA major battle is being fought between allied and axis tank formations at El Alamein.  The enemy are exacting very heavy losses on the axis forces, although they are suffering severe losses of their own. The difference is that with replacements flowing freely through the Suez canal the enemy can better afford their losses.\n\nThe fuel and reserve situation is critical for our side. We have already stretched our supply lines and are vulnerable to interdiction both here on the coastal roads and at sea. Two of our fuel tankers were sunk yesterday enroute to Africa. There is a feeling that everything now hangs in the balance.\n\nOur fighters and Stukas are doing their best to support the army but we are greatly outnumbered by the commonwealth air forces. Our job is to patrol the airspace over the battlefield and attack the enemy fighter bombers whenever possible.\n\n'Victory in the Mediterranean would enable the British to invade Italy herself and would thus open a door into Europe. New Gallipolis lay tantalisingly on the horizon.' \nAJP Taylor.\n\n\n
