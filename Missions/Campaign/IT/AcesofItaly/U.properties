Description \nNorthern Italy\nOctober 1944\n\nAugust was a relatively quiet month for 2 Gruppo, following the strenuous fighting that took place in July.  We had ended that month with the loss of ten pilots.\n\nDuring late August the Germans attempted to disband the ANR and incorporate its personnel and equipment into the Luftwaffe as an Italian legion.  The response from our men was an almost unanimous refusal to accept the German ultimatum despite threats of deportation to Germany and internment in a concentration camp. \n\nIn the days following this conflict of interests the Germans siezed our aircraft and equipment and forbade any flying by Italians.  In the meantime abroad, Finland and Romania have both switched sides and declared war on Germany and the allies have continued their advances on all fronts except in Italy, where a bloody stalemate persists along the 'Gothic' line with the allies stalled less than 20 kilometres from Bologna. \n\nThere are no Luftwaffe fighter units based in Italy anymore.  The burden of allied airpower is leaning heavily on the Reich itself and all of their assets are needed there to try to defend their own stricken cities.  Richthofen was replaced in September by General Pohl as head of Luftwaffe assets in Italy, which includes of course the Italian air force. \n\nBy the end of September, realising their mistake, the Germans had made plans for the reactivation of the ANR.  Consequently 2 Gruppo is to recieve new Gustavs, whilst 1 Gruppo is to go to Germany to train on the Me109 as a prelude to replacing their Centauros and Veltros.  \n\nFinally, half way through October 2 Gruppo was ready for operations again and on the 19th we attacked a formation of B26 Marauders, claiming no fewer than 11 victories for the loss of one Me109 and its pilot, Serg. Talin. Yesterday allied bombers hit Milan with the loss of 2,000 lives including 200 children when a bomb hit their school. \n\nI don't know about you, but I am feeling in a somewhat vengeful mood this Morning.\n\n'He seemed to be a philosopher and no longer the chief of a Government.'\nOtto Skorzeny on Mussolini\n\n
