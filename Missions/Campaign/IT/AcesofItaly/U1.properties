Description \nNorthern Italy\nNovember 1944\n\nThe obsession now is fuel; how much will the Germans allow us in order to continue our fighter operations. The Gruppo has just transferred to the airbase at Aviano, a move which has been delayed by bad weather, we have been here just over an hour but already an alert has been received about American heavies returning from their targets in Austria.\n\nThere are 6 Me109s ready and every pilot here wants one.  We are among those who have won the toss and, moving quickly, we board our aircraft and start up our engines.  One by one the half dozen Gustavs climb up into the clouds to face impossible odds.\n\n'I am not a statesman, I am more like a mad poet.'  Benito Mussolini\n\n
