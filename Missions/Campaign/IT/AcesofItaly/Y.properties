Description \nNorthern Italy\nApril 1945\n\n'Black Easter Monday.' \n\nThe war is clearly all but over with allied tanks cutting deep into German territory from East and West and almost all of the former axis territories now under enemy occupation.  Partisan activity has increased sharply here in Italy and it is no longer safe for anyone to venture off the base.  To do so alone invites kidnapping and possibly murder at the hands of fellow Italians.  \n\nHere at Aviano our entire serviceable complement of Me109s are at readiness, preparing to scramble against the British and American raids that still continue uninterrupted by concerns about fuel or spare parts.  What on earth is the point of this now I wonder?  Noone can give an answer as to why we continue fighting and yet everyone carries on as if there was a reason and a plan.  We are all infected with Hitler's madness it seems.\n\nThe order comes through from 'Roma' control, formations of B25s with fighter escort are being plotted coming from the South.  The flare goes up and those of us who can take off do so.  We form up in formation, setting an interception course.  Soon we see the American B25s flying below us and we prepare our attack.\n\n'At that precise confused moment, out of the corner of my eye I noticed the bombers passing below us, but also to our right, a cloud of enemy fighters, four of which were diving into us. I screamed into my radio to pull up and face their attack...'\nCavagliano's war diary.\n\n
