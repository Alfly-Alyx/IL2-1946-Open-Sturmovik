Short American fighter bombers are attacking your airfield\n
Description \nTunisia\nJanuary 1943\n\nThe Allied landings in Algeria and Morroco in November have made the war situation in North Africa critical for Italy and Germany.  The port of Tripoli is now in the hands of the British 8th army and most of our forces have retreated into Tunisia.  Now we are fighting desperately to hold onto any kind of presence in Africa at all.\n\nFortunately for us the British haven't been keen on learning the lessons of blitzkrieg and so their advance has been slow, though steady.  We are attempting to halt the allied advance by forming strong defensive barriers in Tunisia with the Afrika Korps and our own troops using the old French forts at Mareth as our line of defence.  The Americans especially have suffered heavy losses when faced with our battle hardened troops but the sheer weight of air power that we fighter pilots are facing is almost overwhelming.\n\nWe are putting up a good effort with the limited resources at our disposal but it is becoming increasingly difficult to operate effectively here under what amounts to an allied air umbrella.\n\nSuddenly our conversation is interrupted by an excited NCO, a teenage boy who almost falls into the room with us.  'American fighter bombers have been spotted inbound to our airfield, get off the ground quickly!'  We don't have to be told twice and are already up the steps and out of the door of our bunker.\n\n'I and the German people are watching the heroic defensive battle waged in Egypt with faithful trust in your powers of leadership and in the bravery of the German-Italian troops...You can show your troops no other way than that which leads to victory or death.' \nAdolf Hitler\n\n
