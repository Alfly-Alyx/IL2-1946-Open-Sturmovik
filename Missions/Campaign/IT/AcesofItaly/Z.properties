Name The last mission
Short \nWith the war drawing to a close your squadriglia encounters the enemy in the air for the last time\n
Description \nNorthern Italy\nApril 1945\n\nFollowing the catastrophic encounter with American Thunderbolts on 'Black Easter Monday' 2 Gruppo has seen little action.  The loss of 6 pilots and 14 Gustavs either shot down or written off has, coupled with the shortage of fuel rendered the Group largely innefective.  We are not alone in this situation, even the Luftwaffe is no longer able to conduct operations of any kind in Italy other than the odd night harassment sortie.  \n\nThe final allied offensive is well underway with German troops falling back to try to avoid encirclement as the enemy close in on Bologna.  The fuel situation is affecting the armies ability to move too however and surrender must surely now be the only option.  We have been ordered to transfer to Villafranca and so obediently we climb into our clapped out Messerschmitts and fire them up.\n\nSeveral of the aircraft are running a bit rough and one or two pilots signal their intention to abort the flight. As the formation climbs away from the airfield one Gustav after another falls out of formation to return to base with technical problems.  Six aircraft have left the formation.\n\n'No war ever has been or will be popular.  Wars only become popular when they end in victory.'\nBenito Mussolini\n\n
