Description \nTunisia\nMay 1943\n\nThe evacuation of Tunisia is well underway. At last we have permission to salvage what we can and withdraw from the continent. It is probably too late for most of the soldiers and other personell still here.  At least we airmen can simply fly out when the time comes. \n\nWe are the last Italian air unit left here in Tunisia and the order to evacuate is expected to arrive shortly.  The Luftwaffe are flying in as much fuel as their Ju52s and Me323s can carry and taking as many men back with them as they can. Allied fighters have taken a terrible toll on these vulnerable aircraft though.  German Zerstorers flying escort have only provided the single engined enemy fighters with more easy targets.\n\nDuring the battles of the past couple of months the RAF have been using their fighters in a close support role in the same way that the Germans like to (or rather used to) employ their Stukas.  The Hurricanes concentrate on our tanks with their 40mm guns while the Kittyhawks attack our gun positions with bombs and machine guns and all the time the multi engined bombers fly over with impunity to carpet the whole area with high explosive under a protective screen of Spitfires.  It's sheer hell for everyone from the General in his headqaurters to the caterers in their field kitchens.  \n\nFollowing the victory of the 8th Army at Mareth our armies were chased all the way up the coast to Tunis itself by enemy fighters, although our Macchis and JG77s Gustavs continued to put up a spirited defence against them.  \n\nAnother wave of transports for the evacuation is coming in now from Sicily; German Me323 Gigants and Junkers 52s.  We must rendezvous off the coast and escort them in the rest of the way. We have lost so many of these precious transport aircraft that few more flights like this can be expected.  No-one needs to tell you that there are dozens of enemy aircraft patrolling every kilometre of airspace in the region so we don't just expect trouble, we can count on it.  The transports will be flying low, hugging the waves and praying that the enemy fighters don't spot them.  We have to do our best to protect these brave, unsung heroes.\n\n'Anyway, the situation is not as grave as you make out.  Time is still on our side.' \nBenito Mussolini\n\n
