Name Biplane duels over the desert
Short \nNorth Africa 1940\nA patrol near the Libyan frontier in the CR42\n
Description \nItalian Cyrenaica\nAugust 1940\n\nThe British have surprised everyone by refusing to consider putting an end to the war even though the terms offered to them were decent and fair.  Now our German partners are bombing RAF airfields in England out of existence in preparation for an invasion.  An Italian expeditionary force is gathering in Belgium in order to take part in the attack. The whole world expects that the stubborn British will be forced to capitulate in a matter of weeks.\n\nAlthough we fighter pilots have no particular hatred toward the enemy, I suspect that they will regret their belicosity when they finally do come to the negotiating table.  Il Duce and the Fuhrer will be in no mood for generosity.\n\nOur Squadriglia is based in Libya following the success of the French campaign.  The main British fighter in the region is the Gloster Gladiator biplane, an aircraft not unlike our own Falcos.  In recent combats the score has been about even between the two types. The RAF fighter pilots are certainly to be respected. \n\nMarshall Graziani is preparing a great offensive to push the British out of Egypt.  For now, while the forces to carry out this great endeavour are being assembled we patrol daily over the sandy frontier, shooting down RAF reconnaissance machines and skirmishing sometimes with their fighters.  Most of the time however, these patrols are fruitless and we don't see so much as a solitary camel train during our flight.\n\nToday we are flying another of these boring patrols up to the British line.\n\n'You must obey because you must.'\nBenito Mussolini.\n\n\n
