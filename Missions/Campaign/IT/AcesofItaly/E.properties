Short Fly a sweep over Malta in the Macchi 200\n
Description \nThe aerial campaign against Malta\nJuly1941\n\nIn the Spring the Italian army, together with the German wehrmacht launched a renewed offensive in Greece. At last after a hard Winter of bitter fighting in the snow and sleet, Athens fell and Greece surrendered.  A daring, though expensive invasion of Crete followed shortly afterwards by German airborne forces.\n\nFollowing a short rest from operational flying you have been assigned to a Macchi 200 squadron based in Sicily.\n\nWe must subjugate the Island of Malta which is a major factor in the British capacity to continue their presence in North Africa and Palestine.  We are flying daily escort missions over the Island for fleets of Italian bombers.  Every military establishment, airfield, dock and supply dump has been pounded into dust and rubble and still they hold out.  The islands defence is no longer the joke that it was a year ago with just a handful of Gladiator biplanes. If we had made a serious effort then, we would not have to finish the job against a much stronger foe now.\n\nDuring the Summer most of the Luftwaffe units operating alongside the RA transferred to the Eastern front to assist in the invasion of Russia.  The responsibility for successful attacks on Malta now lies entirely with ourselves without aid from experienced German forces.  On the other hand the RA have gained a great deal of experience of air combat against the British and our divebomber and torpedo bomber units in particular are well known for their brave and skilful operations.\n\nSeveral squadrons of RAF Hurricanes are operating from Malta's airfields and although we are inflicting heavy casualties among them, they are reappearing after each sortie to meet us again. The survivors of an important British convoy are nearing the Islands and an all out effort is being made to sink these ships.  Our mission is to sweep the sky of British fighters so that the bombers can do their work unmolested.\n\n'I have two major preoccupations-oil and Malta'\nItalian chief of staff\n\n
