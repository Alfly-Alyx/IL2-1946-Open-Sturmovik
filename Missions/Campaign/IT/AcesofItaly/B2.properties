Short \nOctober 1940\nItalian Cyrenaica\nTake a new pilot for a familiarisation flight\n
Description \nItalian Cyrenaica\nOctober 1940\n\nThere have been some vicious contests between our squadriglia of Falcos and the British Gloster pilots since we arrived at this desert outpost.  Some of our friends and fellow pilots have given their lives for Italy already and replacements have arrived from the training schools.\n\nBritain remains unsubjugated and dangerous. Hitler has been forced to postpone his invasion of England until next year and the Luftwaffe has been left licking it's wounds now that it has met a serious adversary.\n\nThis war we have gotten ourselves involved in might drag on a little longer and prove costlier than Adolf and Benito anticipated.\nBut ours is not to question why as the English poet once said.  We all believe in eventual victory, but some of us are beginning to wonder at what cost?\n\nOne of the new pilots is just about ready for operational flying.  He has proved himself perfectly adequate in all disciplines connected with his trade.  Now an experienced pilot will take him up on a familiarisation flight of the front line, if the thin strand of wire can be called that.  He's been warned to keep a good look out all the time that he's in the air.  Besides, He'll be safe enough in your hands.\n\n'Who makes this war?'\n'It is the infidel'\n'Against whom, and why?'\n'It is infidel against infidel, who knows why?'\nPaolo Caccia Dominioni\n\n
