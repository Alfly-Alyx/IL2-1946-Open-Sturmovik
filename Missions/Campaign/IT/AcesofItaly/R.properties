Description \nNorthern Italy\n2 Gruppo Caccia\nJune 1944\n\nNumber 1 Gruppo Caccia has suffered such heavy losses in the past few months that it has had to be replenished by the G55 fighters of 2 Gruppo, which were handed over last month. These will fly alongside the Macchi 205Vs that are still serviceable with that unit.  2 Gruppo meanwhile is reequipping with the German BF109G-6. \n\nOne Gruppo has suffered a serious morale problem recently and its' officers have grown angry at what they see as German meddling and control. This came to a head last month when it's pilots where given the choice of simply returning home to their families.  As a result of this friction some have taken extended leave. 2 of 1 Gruppos 3 squadriglia have now been disbanded for the time being.\n\nOther important news this month; Rome has been occupied by the enemy and allied forces have now also landed in Northern France.\n\nAs for you, you are now reassigned to number 2 Gruppo where you have spent the whole of June mastering the 'Gustav'.  On the 22nd of June we made a botched intercept of B24s, achieving nothing on our first combat flying with the 109. \n\nToday we were scrambled off the ground at Cascina Vaga to intercept french fighter bombers. As we took off one of our fighters went off the runway and turned over. Later we learned that the pilot was unhurt but trapped upside down in the cockpit.  As rescue efforts went underway the aircraft burst into flames and the poor pilot; Gino Gamberini was burned to death.  Later, rags were found stuffed into the oil cooler and supercharger intakes and a groundcrewman has confessed to sabotage, claiming that he is a partisan.\n\nWe did not know anything of this horror story until later, after we returned from a successful sortie with a couple of French P47s under our belts.  You are certainly flourishing these days as a marksman and as a pilot.  Your reputation is growing steadily and you are regarded as one of the very finest fighter pilots in the ANR.\n\n\n\n\n\n
