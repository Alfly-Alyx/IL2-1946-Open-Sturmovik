Name Spitfires
Short A dogfight with a patrol of RAF Spitfires over the desert\n
Description \nNorth Africa\nNovember 1942\n\nSince the allied victory at Alamein Italian and German forces have been falling back toward the West and defensive lines in Tripolitania. Of 96,000 men involved in the recent battle we have lost 59,000 killed, wounded or captured. There is no hiding the magnitude of this disaster.\n\nThe supply problem has become an increasingly serious difficulty and is affecting our day to day operations.  the Royal Navy and RAF are interdicting our shipping in the Meditteranean and loss of their vital cargoes is a serious blow to our ability to make war in the region.  The loss of men and materials is horrific. Once we have established a defensible line with shortened supply routes the situation will hopefully stabilise and we can perhaps prepare an effective counter to the British advance.\n\nOur small cadre of German and Italian fighter squadrons continue to patrol aggressively in the face of massive numbers of British and American warplanes.  A small formation of German Heinkels are going to bomb the enemy airfield at Bir Hacheim, we are going to fly a sweep in support of this raid.\n\n'I have a thorn in my heart, because the defeated French still have their empire, while we have lost ours.'\nBenito Mussolini\n\n
