Name Invasion of Sicily
Short Defending Sicily from invasion\n
Description \nSicily\nJuly 1943\n\nA large allied seaborne invasion of Sicily has been launched.  Our forces in the area could hardly believe the sheer scale of the invasion, and radar operators during the night thought that their equipment was faulty they had so many contacts. But there's no mistaking in the cold light of day that they're here and established on Sicilian soil with a massive beach head covering much of the islands Southern coastline.\n\nOur mission is virtually impossible. Faced with an allied air umbrella of around 5,000 aircraft we have a pitiful arsenal of just a few squadrons of worn out Macchis and about 130 German Me109s.  Our airfields are under near incessant attack together with just about every other military target on the island including the support, transport and supply network.  Our Macchis are going on a sweep over Southern Sicily to engage the enemy air forces ranging freely there.  Anti aircraft fire will be very heavy near the beachheads so be careful about straying into enemy held territory and it goes without saying that when you do encounter the enemy air force you can expect to be outnumbered.\n\n'But if we detach ourselves from Germany, what then? One day at a specified hour we broadcast a message to the enemy. What would happen?' Benito Mussolini\n\n
