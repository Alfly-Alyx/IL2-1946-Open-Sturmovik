Description \nWestern Desert\nOctober 1942\n\nLast night a massive British artillery bombardment signalled the beginning of the allied assault on our forces dug in at El Alamein.  With first light came wave after wave of RAF fighter-bombers to hit our frontline. Large numbers of tactical bombers are hitting our supply dumps near the front line, operating almost with impunity against our meagre fighter cover.\n\nEnemy tanks are slowly negotiating their way through our minefields in the face of heavy and accurate return fire from the frontline armour.  If we are to retain control of the battlefield, we must regain control of the air so that the Stukas can get in to lend direct support against the British tanks.  Our fighters are fuelled and armed and ready for their first patrol of the day.\n\n'As I closed my eyes I felt full of confidence and hope, but never did I think that this was the opening of a campaign that would bring us in so short a time to the very gates of Carthage.'\nMajor-General Sir Francis de Guingand\n\n
