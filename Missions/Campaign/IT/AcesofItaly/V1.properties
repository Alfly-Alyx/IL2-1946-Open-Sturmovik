Description \nNorthern Italy\nDecember 1944\n\nDuring the second half of November our Gruppo was bombed heavily by B24s whilst Spitfires orbitted the airfield to make sure noone tried to interfere. By the time the raid was over the base looked, in the words of one of our ground crewmen, 'like a ploughed field'.  Almost all our Me109s were damaged to varying degrees by the raid and Gruppo 2 was out of action for the rest of the month.\n\nIn Germany a number of pilots from 1 Gruppo are to begin training on the Me163 Komet interceptor.  That should certainly be an interesting experience for them. The idea is that the rocket powered fighter will eventually equip several squadriglie of the ANR.  A nice idea but I doubt if it will happen in this war.  Meanwhile 2 Gruppo has been moving around between bases to confuse allied reconnaissance and hopefully avoid the attentions of the fighter bombers.\n\nAlert! B25s are reported bombing targets in the Po valley.  Look out for escort fighters.\n\n'I have not in fact been a dictator, because my power was no more than the will of the Italian people.'\nBenito Mussolini\n\n\n
