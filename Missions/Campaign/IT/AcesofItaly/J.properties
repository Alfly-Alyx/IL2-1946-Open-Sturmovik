Name Intercept the bombers
Short Intercept another enemy bombing raid\n
Description \nTunisia\nMarch 1943\n\nThe situation in Africa is grave. The British and American forces have linked up from the East and from the West in Tunisia and the end here appears to any sane person to be imminent. Still we are being told to hold on while more resources are sent to reinforce our position.\n\nThere have been significant air reinforcements by the Luftwaffe and now we have a formidable force of seasoned fighter and ground attack pilots with Me109Gs, FW190s and the HS129 tankbusters that have been so successful on the Eastern front.  If only we had had them here a year ago. The crack German JG77 fighter group have also arrived from the Eastern front and have done much to help balance things out.  \n\nThe past few months have seen our fortunes turn sour with the loss of an entire army at Stalingrad and the Japanese defeat at Guadalcanal.  Now it looks as if another army is to be thrown away here in Africa. Last month the allies crossed into Tunisia from Libya but Rommel gambled on an attack against the Americans in the West.  His gamble paid off and the Americans came close to being routed by our experienced troops.\n\nTowards the end of February the allied air offensive began in preparation for their ground assault.  They were met by a skilled and courageous air defence which inflicted heavy losses on them. However sheer weight of numbers means that this can't be maintained indefinitely.  Fighter bomber attacks and strikes by medium and heavy bombers on our fighter airfields have caused significant losses during late February and early March and there has been a subsequent loss of operational capability.  It is now the middle of the month and signs of the approaching allied offensive are growing stronger every day. Anytime now we will be fighting with our backs to the sea.\n\nA telephone rings from a table in the corner of the dispersal bunker making everyone jump. Our nerves can't take much more of this treatment.  'Another enemy bombing raid is coming in, get up and intercept them but watch out for the escort fighters.'  We hurry outside in our sweat stained tunics and run toward the sandbagged pens where our Macchis wait. In seconds our wheels leave the ground and we are climbing flat out in pursuit, the voice of the controller rasping in our headsets with the course, altitude, and other details of the enemy formation.  A quick glance around as we soar skyward, the Macchis look beautiful, strung out in their battle formation and you feel suddenly confident of meeting whatever the Tommies and the Americans have to offer.\n\n\n
