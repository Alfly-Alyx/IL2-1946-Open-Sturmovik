Description \nNorthern Italy\nJuly 1944\n\nJuly is proving to be a  busy month for 2 Gruppo.  Several times a day we are flying patrols or being scrambled to meet enemy formations, often encountering the allied medium bombers and escort fighters.   The British, American and French forces in this area are concentrating on the bridges and transport network around the Po valley aiming at halting any movement of supplies and reinforcements in the region.\n\nWe have begun using a new formation with a 'schwarm' of 4 aircraft always flying top cover. This is known as 'Occhio di Lince' (Lynx Eye) and is hopefully helping to decrease the potential for casualties during our encounters with the enemy air forces.\n\n'What is fascism? Fascism is Mussolinism. It is a product of the modern crisis-the crisis of a man who can no longer remain within the normal bounds of the existing laws.  One could call it irrationalism.'  Benito Mussolini\n\n
