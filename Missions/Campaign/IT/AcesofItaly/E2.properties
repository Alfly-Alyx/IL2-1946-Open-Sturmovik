Name Malta raid
Short Escort another raid on Malta\n
Description \nMalta campaign\nSeptember 1941\n\nThe bombing campaign against the enemy held fortress of Malta continues unabated.  Large scale raids against targets on the island have been taking place up to 3 times a day since you arrived in Sicily almost 2 months ago.  The British have been increasing their fighter defences gradually thanks to some daring resupply operations from aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean.  Almost every sortie we fly is met by the tenacious defenders in their Hurricanes.\n\nPersonally, for one reason or another you have not been in a position very often to shoot down any of the RAF fighters.  We always outnumber them and it is sometimes a free for all between ourselves and our few remaining Luftwaffe colleagues as to who reaches the enemy fighters first.  We fighter pilots in the RA of course don't forget our primary mission which is to defend the bombers, and perhaps for that reason more than any question of equipment or training, the Luftwaffe usually seem to claim the lions share of kills.\n\nThe sun is splitting the sky and dazzles us as it hits the waves far below.  A mass of bombers surround us in front, behind and to the sides.  We take position in the vast formation and set course for Malta once again.\n\n'I feel your voices are vibrating with an incorruptible faith, have no fear for ultimate victory.' Benito Mussolini\n\n
