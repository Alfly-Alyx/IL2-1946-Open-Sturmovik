Description \nNorthern Italy\nJuly 1944\n\nYour flight of Me109s is at readiness when you recieve the order to take off.  Control advise you on course and altitude to make a succesful interception of another enemy fighter/bomber mixed formation.  Before long the enemy aircraft come into view flying at low altitude on their way to targets in the North. \n\nAs you draw closer you see that it is the now familiar mix of twin engined tactical bombers and single engined escorts, American Thunderbolts this time.  You know that there are also some German fighters being vectored onto the same formation.  Hopefully they are not too far off now.  Your flight spreads out in a well practiced manouevre and prepares for the coming engagement. \n\nThe two formations approach each other head on at well over 700 km per hour.  How strange to think that in a few seconds men will be dead and perhaps you yourself will be oblivious to this drama in the sky.\n\n'All responsible Italians where against Mussolini, and against the war.' \nCarol Pareschi-Italian minister of agriculture, during his treason trial in 1944.\n\n
