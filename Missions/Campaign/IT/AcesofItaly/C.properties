Name The Balkan adventure begins
Short \nAlbania 1940\nPatrol the Albanian coast in a G50 monoplane\n
Description \nAlbania\nNovember 1940\n\nIn October our forces invaded Greece in order to strengthen and consolidate our strategic situation. There have been reversals for one reason or another and progress against the Greek army, backed by the British has been slow to begin with.\n\nYou have been posted to Albania to conduct operations over Northern Greece and also to defend our ports there from air attack. Your new squadriglia is equipped with modern Fiat G50 monoplanes with retractable undercarriage. You are flying as part of a two aircraft patrol along the Albanian coast to counter attacks by RAF Blenheims and Wellingtons.\n\n'Hitler always presents me with a fait accompli, this time I am going to pay him back in his own coin.  He will find out from the papers that  I have occupied Greece.'\nBenito Mussolini, October 1940\n\n\n
