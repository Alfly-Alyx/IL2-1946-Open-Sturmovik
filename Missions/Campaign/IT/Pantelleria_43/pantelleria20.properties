In 1943 the local power station had not been completed yet, and by the final days of the siege it had also been damaged by enemy raids, leaving the water pumps with no power. Pantelleria had to be supplied with fresh water by air until the eve of the Allied landing. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
