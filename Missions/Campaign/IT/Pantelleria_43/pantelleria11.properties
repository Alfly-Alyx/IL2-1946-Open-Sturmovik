People on the island need supplies, food and fresh water. The enemy is still blocking access by sea, so the only solution we have left is to use our cargo planes.\nToday our mission is to escort transport planes to Pantelleria. \nAt 17:00 hours we will be about 30 km. North-East of the island heading 200; staying on that route we should be at Marghana airfield (DH-66) by 17:10, there we will cover our transports' landing. Return Route:  Heading 310 to grid sector DG-67 and then heading 020 to sector  DH-70, there we should safe.\n\nWarning: \nyou have only 50% fuel!\nFly low in order to avoid enemy radars!\nBuona fortuna\n\n*************************************************\n****** AIRCRAFT PAINT SCHEME ******\n                     MC202_XII_1st[NM]\n                           markings: on\n*************************************************\n*************************************************\nBackground:\n\nAs the British Navy was blocking sea access to Pantelleria, delivering fuel, ammunition, food, water and other supplies to the island was getting increasingly difficult for the Italians. Those tasks and other services such as evacuation of women, children and the wounded, were to be carried out by air despite a great deal of technical and operational difficulties.\nSupplies were dropped on the island by night with many dangers, not least the risk of crashing into the hills. For a series of technical issues, cargo planes had to climb at least to 800m before launching their packages, but as they did, enemy radars would locate them, enemy fighers would be launched to intercept them... \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
