Some of the new fighters C.205 series 1 have eventually been delivered to us. Today you will fly the new aircraft in a free hunt over Pantelleria.\nAs you know, recent enemy raids have destroyed our radar station on the island. Unfortunately, radars located in Sicily are not capable of detecting enemy planes approaching Pantelleria early enough for us to scramble, which forces us to fly as many patrol missions as possible, and at the same time protect Sicilian harbors and airfields.\nThe brutal truth is that the situation is going to get even worse. Keeping the current operational standard is going to be very hard, even though we can count on the loyal contribution by the German Air Force.\n\nToday's mission: reconnaissance flight in force to the south of Pantelleria. At 12:00 hours we will be in grid sector DM-63, east of the island. Some German units of I/JG53 flying Bf109's and some from our own 150th Gruppo "Gigi tre Osei" ("Three-birds Louie") will be there to help us. From DM-63 head 270 to grids DG-62-63 (secondary target). We must protect our coast defence artillery located on the South side of the island. Return route: heading 360 to grid DG-68 (primary target).\n\nWarnings:\nlimited ammo and fuel.\n\n************************************************\n****** AIRCRAFT PAINT SCHEME ******\n                     MC205_I_1st[NM]\n                            markings: on\n************************************************\n************************************************\n\nBackground:\n\Trying to counter Allied activity in the area, Italian and German Air Forces increased the number of free hunt missions in defense of Pantelleria starting from June 1st. One particular report from the Aeronautical Command of Sicily states that 323 Italian and 455 German fighters flew free hunt missions over Pantelleria June 1st through  10th .\n\nMeanwhile, Allied commanders Spaatz (NAAF) and Coningham (NATAF)(*) in consultation with the High Aerial Operations Commander Tedder, decided that the aerial onslaught was to be carried on in two distinct parts: in late May through June 6, heavy bombing would be intensified. In the second phase, June 7 through 11, Pantelleria was to be attacked around the clock.\n\n\n(*) Among other Allied Air Commands for North Africa and the Mediterranean, were NAAF (North Africa Air Force) and NATAF (North-east Africa Tactical Air Force [part of NAAF]). \n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
