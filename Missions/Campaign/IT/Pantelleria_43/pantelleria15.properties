Head-on attacks reduced the risk of being shot down by gunners. \nMore than a few times Italian pilots managed to get on enemy fighters' tails and even to shoot down some of them, despite being outnumbered and flying underarmed aircraft. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
