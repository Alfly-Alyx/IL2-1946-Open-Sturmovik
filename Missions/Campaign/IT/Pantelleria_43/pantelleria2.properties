We have been seeing them since last April, they only stop to refuel and quikcly depart again, heading for Sicily.\nOur troops are withdrawing from Tunisia as we speak, and that can only mean one thing: we are going to meet the enemy right here.\nOur job right now is to protect the ships.\n\n The enemy is expected to show up most probably in grid sectors: DF67; DE67; DE65.\nYou will be escorting two of our reconnaissance Cant.Z 506 B (JU 52) that are coming from Sicily.\nWatch out! Enemy planes have been reported near Pantelleria. If you see them, reconnaissance aircraft will head back home immediately while you fighters engage the enemy.\n\nSummary:\n #1: Escort our Cant.Z 506B (secondary target).\n#2 Patrol grid sectors DF6; DE67; DE65. (secondary target)\n#3: Engage enemy (hidden target).\n#4) The mission is completed when you come back to Marghana airfield and land. (Primary target)\nBuona fortuna! (good luck)\n\n\nRemove chocks to take off. (bind a key to action "toggle chocks")\nLimited fuel and ammo.\n\n*************************************************\n ****** AIRCRAFT PAINT SCHEME ****** \n                          MC202_VII_1st[NM]\n                                 markings: on\n*************************************************\n*************************************************\n\nBackground:\n\nThe few Italian and German men and aircraft left in Tunisia couldn't give but a poor contribution to operations in North Africa, mostly because of the huge air superiority enjoyed by the Allied. 200,000 men between German and Italian forces were deployed on a front about 190km (120mi) from Cape Serrat to Endifidaville and were frontally attacked by the Allied with the 8th British Army on April 15.\n\n The Italian 1st Armata and the German 5th were confronted by the 1st British Army and the American 2nd Armored Division on may 6th.\nOn May 8th the Axis high Command gave order to withdraw from Africa and announced that German and Italian forces would be evacuated by sea.\n But it was much too late.\nOnly four days later, on April 13th, Axis commanders with their wounded and exhausted troops surrendered.\nBesides the 9000 men who got evacuated before the surrender, starting from the beginning of April, only a few hundreds men of the defeated Axis Forces managed to escape to Sicily by sea or by air, anyone else were taken prisoner. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
