According to recognition reports, Allied Forces seem to be preparing a landing with amphibious units. We are sending some M.C.200 fighter-bombers to attack them and you guys will be the escort. German units will be in the area with both fighter-bombers and fighters. Your first priority is to protect our fighter-bombers; stay with the MC.200's as they approach Pantelleria from grid sector DJ-67 heading 270 and cover them until they locate and attack their targets. Come back through grid sector DF-67 and DF-70 heading 360. \n\nWarning:\nLimited ammo and fuel (50%). \n\n***********************************************\n******* AIRCRAFT PAINT SCHEME  *******\n                        MC205_I_1st[NM]\n                                markings: on\n***********************************************\n***********************************************\n\nBackground:\n\nOn June 11th, 1943, one hundred and twenty-six Axis airplanes took off from Sicily: 9 Italian M.C.200 figher-bombers escorted by 16 fighters, and 60 German FW190 fighter-bombers escorted  by 41 fighters. Their mission: attack Allied naval forces that had begun operation for the landing on Pantelleria. n\\nThat was to be the last mission in the battle for Pantelleria, followed within a short time by the request of capitulation advanced from the Commander of the Island, Adm. Gino Pavesi, who realized that it was over and tried to avoid further loss of lives among both military personnel and local civilians. The surrender was received and accepted by Allied commanders in charge of Operation Corkscrew. Shortly thereafter, British troops landed for the first time on Italian soil. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
