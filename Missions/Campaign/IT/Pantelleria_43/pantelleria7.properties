We have some help from German units of I/JG53 flying  Bf-109G-6.\n Orders are to patrol from grid sector DI-70 heading 220 to DG-67, have a look at Pantelleria harbor and remember that all information is important, then get back to grid sector DI68, that's heading 060.\nBuona fortuna!\n\nWarning:\nLimited ammo and fuel\n\n*************************************************\n ****** AIRCRAFT PAINT SCHEME ****** \n                         MC202_XII_1st[NM]\n                               markings: on\n*************************************************\n*************************************************\n\nBesides being subjected to Allied bombings since the last few days of the Tunisian campaign, Pantelleria was also under naval blockade starting from May 14th.\nAlthough the remaining outpost on Pantelleria was equipped with a radar station and more radars were being deployed in Sicily, trying to defend the island from the air was getting increasingly harder for German and Italian units.\nFree hunt missions over Pantelleria had to be abandoned as they became impossible to carry out due to unavailability of aircraft in sufficient numbers to fight for Pantelleria and at the same time provide protection to Sicilian harbors and airports. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
