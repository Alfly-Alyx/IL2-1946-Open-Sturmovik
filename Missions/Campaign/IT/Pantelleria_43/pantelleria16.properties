If you run short of fuel, fly back to end-mission checkpoint immediately (grid sector DF-65).\nBe aware that some of our vessels may be in the area, don't attack the wrong ships! \n\nWarning:\nlimited ammo and very limited fuel.\n\nbuona fortuna.\n\n**********************************************\n****** AIRCRAFT PAINT SCHEME ******\n                     MC205_I_1st[NM]\n                            markings: on\n**********************************************\n**********************************************\nBackground:\n\nOn june 6th, four M.C.200's fighter-bombers escorted by 21 fighters were supposed to attack Allied ships between Pantelleria and Capo Bon.
