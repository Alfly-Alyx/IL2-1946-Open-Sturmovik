Things are bad on Pantelleria, and it 's not going to get any better. Enemy raids increase in number every day and they're also getting more violent. We have reached a point where our effort can be compared to fighting a raging fire with a glass of water. Never the less, no matter how tired we may be, and despite knowing that Pantelleria is lost anyway, We must go on. We must, so no-one can say that to we we're lacking courage!\n Mission target today: detect and engage enemy aircraft. We will fly with pilots from 150th gruppo  "Gigi tre Osei". 1st stormo will fly east of Pantelleria at 16:00 hours heading 270 to the intersection between grids Dj-65 and DK-65. Patrol the zone and then come back home heading 360 through grids DJ-68 and DK-68. Pilots of "Gigi tre Osei" will patrol the Southern side of the island.\nBuona caccia!\n\nWarning:\nlimited ammo and fuel. If you are hit in the fuel tank, you must return to base immediately.\n  \n***********************************************\n****** AIRCRAFT PAINT SCHEME ******\n                     MC205_I_1st[NM]\n                           markings: on\n***********************************************\n***********************************************\n\nBackground:\n\nAfter about a month of uninterrupted bombings and strafings, most of the artillery of Pantelleria was destroyed. Communication and power lines were unusable, food was scarce and so was water, which could only be delivered by tank trucks that made easy targets during enemy raids. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
