It's a good aircraft, much better than our older fighters; it's very maneuverable and has a fairly powerful engine but it is somewhat underarmed. \nYou will start from the parking outside the hangars and take off accelerating down the taxiway right in front of your starting point.\nThat's not a standard procedure but knowing how to takeoff and land on short narrow strips can be a life-saver in an emergency.\nFollow the instructor's plane during take-off, do exactly as he does and everything should be fine.\nFly the checkpoints marked on your map: in grid sector DH65 there's a balloon at 2400m of altitude: that's your target, and it will blow up real nice!\nAfter shooting the balloon, land and taxi back to the parking in front of the hangars (primary target).\n\nSummary:\n#1: take-off from the parking in front of the hangars down the diagonal taxiway.\n#2: Fly the checkpoints marked on your map (Secondary target).\n#3: Take down the target in DH65 (balloon at 2400m.)\n#4: Land and taxi back to the hangar using the taxiways. (Primary target)\nThat would be all. Buona fortuna! (Good luck)\n\nWarning:\nRemove chocks in order to take-off (bind a key to "toggle chocks" action).\nLimited ammo and fuel.\nTake off and landing on taxiways !!!\n\n*************************************************\n ****** AIRCRAFT PAINT SCHEME ****** \n                      MC202_VII_1st[NM]\n                              markings on\n*************************************************\n*************************************************\n\nBackground:\n\nPantelleria is a small rocky island, only 8.5 x 5.5 statute miles in size. It is located between Tunisia and Sicily about 140mi (225km) NW of Malta.\nFor its position and strategic relevance, Pantelleria could be considered the Italian anti-Malta, a fortified island-base located right on the spot where Eastern and Western Mediterranean meet.\nUnderground hangars were built to shelter fighters and fighter-bombers. When the Allied attack came, Pantelleria was defended by the 6th and 17th Gruppo of 1st Stormo  and  the 22mo Gr.Aut.C. and 151st Gruppo of 53th Stormo. They flew Macchi C.202 Folgore, C.205 Veltro and Fiat G.50 Freccia.\n\nNotes:\nThe word "stormo" litterally  means "flock" as in a birdflock. The Italian  Air Force operated in big "Stormi" (flocks), each divided in a number of "Gruppi" (groups).\nA Gruppo included several "Squadriglie" (squadrons) and a Squadriglia was divided in "Sezioni", (litterally "sections", in this contest meaning "units"). The Sezione was the smallest unit, a few planes strong.\n"22mo G.Aut.C." stands for "22th Gruppo Autonomo Caccia", or "Independent Fighter Group", where "independent" indicates a Gruppo that did not belong to any particular Stormo and could be easily relocated without upsetting military bureaucrats. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
