Short \n
Description ******* 1943 Pantelleria, Italy: Operation Corkscrew *******\n\nWelcome to this semi-historical campaign based on a pilot of the Italian Regia Aeronautica during the defense of Pantelleria in the summer of 1943.\nYou will fly Macchi C.202 "Folgore" series 7 and series 12, and Macchi C.205 "Veltro" series 1.\n\For this campaign, you should choose the lowest or the second-lowest available rank; starting with a higher rank you will often find yourself placed in the wrong plane and/or at the wrong starting point (Sound Mod users: only the very lowest rank will work properly).\n\nYou may want to disable the option "No instant success" (red light OFF). Although this is not required, it is probably a good choice, considering that starting your campaign with 'no instant success' enabled (red light ON) you will need to successfully complete each mission before being allowed to fly the following one.\nWith "No Instant Success" disabled, on the other hand, you may decide to go on to the next mission, no matter the outcome of the last one as long as your pilot survives the mission without being captured.\n\nMaps used: Hawaii for Pantelleria; Kuban for Sicily.\nAuthor: Cortomaltese \ne-mail: pietro_marotta1@tin.it\n\nBackground:\nQuote from "L'Arma Aerea Italiana" [The Italian Air Force] by Sebastiano Licheri:\n"The island of Pantelleria and the neighboring islands of Lampedusa, Lampione and Linosa, with their great strategical and tactical relevance, could pose a serious threat to the planned development of Operation Husky (the invasion of Sicily).\nThe occupation of said islands, in particular Pantelleria and Lampedusa, would spare many risks to the Allied and provide them with consistent advantages. The Allied high Command decided for the invasion of Pantelleria (Operation Corkscrew) and planned the occupation for june 11, 1943."\n\nOperation Corkscrew was the first Mediterranean D-Day; it showed the perfect harmony that British and American Armed Forces had achieved in the highly co-ordinated teamwork of Army, Navy and Air Force.\n\nThe weird nickname "Corkscrew" originates from the location of Pantelleria less than 100 miles (160km) south of Sicily and about the same distance from Tunisia, in the relatively narrow Sicilian Straits.\nIn terms of military strategy Pantelleria could be seen as a "cork" in the bottleneck between Eastern and Western Mediterranean: taking that cork out would give the Allied great freedom of movement from Gibraltar to Suez.\n\nPlans for an Allied invasion of Sicily had been discussed and approved but operations couldn't get started as long as the Sicilian Straits islands were in the way: with their radio direction finders, troops stationed on both major islands, and a modern airfield with large underground hangars on Pantelleria, they could be the perfect home base for possible Axis' counter-offensives; as long as they held those islands, the Axis' ability to cause trouble in the Mediterranean could not be underestimated.\n\nCapturing the bases would protect invasion forces and allow the Allies to deploy fighters to protect their ships and men during the first stage of Operation Husky. Reluctant to invade, General Eisenhower decided to bomb the defenders into surrender.\nOperation Corkscrew included an experimental side: besides building an useful toe-hold for the planned invasion of Sicily and Italy, it would also test the actual effectivity of large-scale bombings on strong entrenched defensive positions before landing troops.
