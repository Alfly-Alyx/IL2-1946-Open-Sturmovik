Worth remembering among others the protection of naval traffic and aerial transports, and numerous search and rescue operations. The latter had not been planned before the war, and when the time came, specifically trained units for this kind of operations did not exist.\nAerial search and rescue operations at sea were initially carried out by Sections equipped with Cant.Z 501-506 seaplanes, with crews including doctors and paramedics. Said Sections were deployed to several opportunely chosen locations; they provided search and rescue services for Axis Forces anywhere in the Mediterranean. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
