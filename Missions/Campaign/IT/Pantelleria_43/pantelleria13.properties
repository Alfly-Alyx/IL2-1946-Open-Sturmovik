The plans to keep artillery pieces too into converted natural caves had to be postponed, leaving Pantelleria's guns in plain view from the air.\n\nAccording to the inspecting committee on led by adm. Iachino, the island had 3 anti-ship positions armed with a total 37 cannons, 12 of which 152mm caliber guns, 13 120mm guns and 12 modern 90mm pieces. Anti-aircraft positions would be 14, armed with 76mm guns for a total 76 pieces. Troops stationed in the island's Garrisons were 11,420 against a local population of some 10,000 with no access to fortified shelters. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
