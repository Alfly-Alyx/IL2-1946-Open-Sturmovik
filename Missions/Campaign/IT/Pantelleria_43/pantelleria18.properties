On June 8th the Royal Navy carried out a heavier attack against the harbor and the coast defense guns using five cruisers and three torpedo boats. \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
