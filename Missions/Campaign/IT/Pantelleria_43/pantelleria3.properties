(Gentlemen, good afternoon)\nEnemy bombers escorted by several fighters have been reported in the area, they are flying back to their home bases after a raid over Sicily and they're getting closer as we speak.\nSome CR.42s stationed in Sicily have tried to intercept them without success; now we must take off and engage them in grid sectors DB66 and DB67.\nYou will fly the new Macchi C.202 series 12: take good care of it! We don't have as many series 12 spare parts as we'd need and if the new planes are damaged you will have to fly the Series 7 again.\n\nSummary:\n#1- Intercept enemy bombers in grid sectors DB67 and DB66,\n#2- Come back through grid DF65 and DH65,\n#3- Land at Marghana airfield (primary target).\n\nBuona fortuna!\n\nWarning: Limited ammo and fuel.\nRemove chocks for take off (bind a key to action "toggle chocks")\n\n*************************************************\n ****** AIRCRAFT PAINT SCHEME ****** \n                          MC202_XII_1st[NM]\n                                markings: on\n*************************************************\n*************************************************\nA growing Allied air superiority forced Italian pilots into free hunt missions in order to try and hinder the always violent enemy raids.\nAircraft were often in poor conditions and men who had been fighting for a long time without interruption badly needed some rest... \n\n================================\n\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\u00A7[]\n================================\n
