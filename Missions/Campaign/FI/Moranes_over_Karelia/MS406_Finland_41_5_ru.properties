Description 12 August 1941\n\nSCRAMBLE! SCRAMBLE!\n\nOne of our naval reconnaissance bombers from Llv 6 was patrolling for Soviet shipping activity in the southern Gulf when it was attacked by multiple fighters. It is racing for home, but the fighters continue their attacks.\n\nAlong with the two I-153s of Llv 6 based here, you will get airborne immediately and drive them off so our bomber can make it back to base. The last reported position of the bomber was 15km southwest of Lavansaari Island, heading north-northwest.\n
