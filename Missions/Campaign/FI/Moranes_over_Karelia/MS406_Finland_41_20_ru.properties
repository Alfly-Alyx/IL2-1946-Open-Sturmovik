Description 30 August 1941\n\nThe Soviets have been driven out of Tallinn by the Germans and are evacuating the remainder of their forces by sea. The Germans are attempting to destroy as much of this force as possible before it can be redeployed against their troops advancing on Leningrad. \n\nThe Ju-88 bombing squadron operating from our base has requested that we escort their aircraft on a strike against Soviet shipping. Command has approved the request, so we will be sending eight aircraft to protect the German bombers.\n\nThe weather is closing in, with rain squalls moving in from the west. The bombers may have a tough time finding their targets from altitude, so they will be descending under the clouds once they reach the reported target area.\n\n\n
