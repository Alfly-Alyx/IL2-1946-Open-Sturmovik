Description 9 August 1941\n\nThe German Luftwaffe has requested temporary use of our base for bomber operations in support of their advance on Leningrad. They wish to strike Soviet transport links between Leningrad and Murmansk to isolate the northern battlefield from resupply and reinforcement.\n\nWe will be hosting a squadron of Ju-88s. They will conduct their transit this morning, escorted by German fighters to the rendezvous point, where your flight will take over. Bring them safely back to base.\n
