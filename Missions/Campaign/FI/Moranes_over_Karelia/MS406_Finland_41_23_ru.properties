Description 3 September 1941\n\nThe fast bombers you encountered two days ago have been identified as Pe-2s. They are appearing in this area in increasing numbers, and represent a serious new threat, as many of our fighters (including your Moranes) cannot catch them in a straight chase, as you discovered. The Soviets seem to be using them in small numbers so far; if massed formations appear, we will find ourselves in a great deal of difficulty.\n\nThis is not the only new type of Soviet aircraft we have encountered recently. The Brewsters of LeLv24 have tangled with heavily-armed LaGG fighters several times now, and cannon-armed Polikarpov I-16s are becoming more common.\n\nToday you will lead all twelve of our operational planes on a deep fighter sweep over the front lines. Soviet air activity has been shifting toward the German front as they approach Leningrad, but there are still plenty of air attacks on our forces every day. Clear the skies of any Soviet planes you encounter.\n\n\n
