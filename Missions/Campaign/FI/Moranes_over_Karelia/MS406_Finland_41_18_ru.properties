Description 29 August 1941\n\nThe Soviet retreat from Viipuri has been successfully cut off and a pocket has been created southeast of the city. The army is afraid of friendly fire, given the close proximity of our troops to enemy positions, so air support is limited to combat air patrols over the pocket to keep the Soviets from providing supply drops or close support to any breakout attempt.\n\nInstead, the squadron will be tasked with attacking Soviet anti-aircraft positions around the city of Koivisto. The Soviets are conducting delaying operations there to allow seaborne evacuations to continue through the night. We will hit them when they do not expect it, using the light of the midnight sun. Bombers from LeLv6 will attack shipping; you must clear the way for them. Since the Soviets do not fly fighters at night, this means striking their anti-aircraft guns.\n\nFirst flight will strike any guns north of the river, while second flight will attack south of it. Several batteries of large-caliber guns are believed to be set up around the city, with smaller caliber guns concentrated near the evacuation beaches.\n\nNote that Suur-Merijoki airfield has been made partially operational and is now available as an emergency field if required.\n
