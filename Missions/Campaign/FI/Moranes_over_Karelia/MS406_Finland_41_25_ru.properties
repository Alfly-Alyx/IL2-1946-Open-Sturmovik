Description 8 September 1941\n\nWith the Soviets now withdrawn from all pre-war Finnish territory, the end of active ground operations appears to be near. Command has ordered our squadron to move to a recently-captured forward airstrip at Kolkkala to better provide air support over the front lines.\n\nYou will escort two of our precious transports carrying ground personnel and vital equipment to the new base. Once they have landed you will land at the new base as well.\n
