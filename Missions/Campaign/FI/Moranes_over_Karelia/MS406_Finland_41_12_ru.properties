Description 24 August 1941\n\nAs they did during the Winter War, Soviet bombers have been striking our rail lines. With the limited rail capacity of the line running east from Helsinki, we cannot afford the disruption to the supplies needed to sustain our offensive.\n\nYou will fly a patrol along the rail line from Luumaki to the supply railhead at Vainikkala. Prevent the Soviets from bombing the line at any point, but be especially aware of the importance of the supply hub at Vainikkala.\n
