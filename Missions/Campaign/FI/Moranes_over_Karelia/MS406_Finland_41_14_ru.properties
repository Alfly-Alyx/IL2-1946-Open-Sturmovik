Description 25 August 1941\n\nToday you will undertake a very dangerous mission. The Soviet airfield at Suur-Merijoki has been a source of great difficulty for our frontline troops besieging Viipuri. Red aircraft takeoff and are almost immediately over our positions, bombing and strafing our troops.\n\nLacking the artillery to put it out of action, we are forced to use aircraft to knock it out. You will conduct a treetop-level sunset raid against the airfield to destroy as many enemy airplanes as possible.\n\nThere are believed to be at least two Soviet squadrons based at Suur-Merijoki, both flying I-153s. You can expect at least some of them to be airborne over the field.\n
