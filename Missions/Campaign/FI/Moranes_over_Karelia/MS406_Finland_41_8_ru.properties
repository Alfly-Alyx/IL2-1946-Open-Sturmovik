Description 15 August 1941\n\nHigh Command has decided to interdict Soviet lines of communication between Leningrad and the front lines. With the number of Soviet aircraft in the area, we must strike very quickly and get out before they can respond.\n\nWith that in mind, our target for today is the rail bridge at Humaljoki. As one of only two rail lines connecting the front with the rear area, this is a vital Soviet communication artery.\n\nYour responsibility is two-fold. First, strike any anti-aircraft near the bridge, clearing the way for the bombers, four Blenheims from Llv 44. Then, climb and provide cover against any enemy fighters that might appear.\n\nAvoid the nearby airfields at Kolkkala and Rompotti.\n
