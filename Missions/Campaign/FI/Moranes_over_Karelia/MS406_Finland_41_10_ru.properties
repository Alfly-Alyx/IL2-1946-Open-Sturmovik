Description 22 August 1941\n\nWe have begun our ground offensive in this sector to reclaim what the Soviets took from us in the Winter War. Our columns are on the move. We must break through their lines quickly.\n\nToday you will fly ground support for a column advancing along the coastal highwaytoward Karppila. The Soviets have established a blocking position there, and we have reports that reinforcements, including a tank unit, are headed in that direction from Viipuri. You will strike the reinforcements to prevent their arrival. If the situation allows, you will then attack targets within Karppila itself.\n\nOur units are in close proximity and continuing to advance - be very careful to positively identify your targets.\n
