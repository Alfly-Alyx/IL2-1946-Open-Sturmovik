Description 13 August 1941\n\nAfter fending off the marauding Soviet fighters and recovering our aircraft, we will attempt to hit the Soviet base on Lavansaari again before dark. We still want to catch those Soviet ships before they move east.\n\nThe strike group will remain as before, as does the plan of attack. Llv 6 will strike the ships, while you will provide air cover should it be necessary; if not, you will attack any aircraft present on the field or floatplanes in the harbor.\n\n
