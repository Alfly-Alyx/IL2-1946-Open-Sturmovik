Description 13 August 1941\n\nYour target for today is the Soviet base on Lavansaari. The airfield has been used by Soviet naval reconnaissance planes from time to time, and there is a floatplane facility there. The reason for this strike is that our naval reconnaissance planes have noted torpedo boats and other shipping there, probably pulling out of Tallinn in front of the German advance. Command would like to catch them now before they pull back to Kronstadt.\n\nYou will fly as part of a composite strike group composed of your flight of four MS406s, two Tupolev bombers and two I-153s from Llv 6. The latter two elements will strike the ships, while you will provide air cover should it be necessary; if not, you will attack any aircraft present on the field or floatplanes in the harbor.\n\nThe Llv 6 planes will take off behind you - form on them for the flight to target. Try to get airborne quickly, as our German guests are returning from their mission and will be landing soon.\n
