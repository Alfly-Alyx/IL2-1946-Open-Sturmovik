Description 10 July 1941\n\nThe Soviets are aggressively employing their air and naval forces against us. Submarines have been spotted among the coastal islands, and there have been numerous attacks by fighters and bombers against our cities, troop concentrations, and airfields.\n\nYou will conduct a fighter sweep along the coastline to intercept any enemy aircraft attempting to violate our airspace.\n\nBe advised that Llv 6 is conducting anti-submarine patrols in the same area with two I-153s (use of the Tupolev has been restricted to areas further west due to the threat of fighters).\n
