Description 28 August 1941\n\nThe Soviets are being driven out of Viipuri and are retreating to the southeast. The roads and rails are littered with the smoking wrecks of Soviet vehicles hammered by our airplanes and artillery.\n\nOur ground forces have cut them off, however, and command anticipates a pocket being formed, which will allow us to crush the communists en masse. You will fly along the northern boundary of the salient and prevent Soviet attack aircraft from assisting their troops trying to break out to the south. \n
