Description 24 August 1941\n\nOur advance down the peninsula is going reasonably well. The Russians are holding firm at Viipuri, but we have broken their lines to the north and are driving southeast toward the shore of Lake Ladoga, with the hope of cutting off a large Soviet force.\n\nThe Soviets are desperately trying to move reinforcements forward. You will interdict their movements along the Terijoki-Viipuri rail line.\n\nYou must take a circuitous route to avoid the cluster of fighter bases around Koivisto. Fly southeast over the Gulf, then turn north and fly up the rail line. Begin your sweep above Terijoki, and do not proceed as far as Viipuri, as the anti-aircraft in the vicinity of the cities is very heavy.\n
