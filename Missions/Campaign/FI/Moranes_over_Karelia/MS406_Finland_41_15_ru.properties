Description 26 August 1941\n\nToday you will be participating in one of the largest air operations we have yet conducted: a combined strike against Soviet positions west of Viipuri.\n\nCommand wants Viipuri taken so that our lines can be shortened and the advance to the old border continued. The Soviets have been putting up strong resistance from prepared positions around Suur-Merijoki airfield as they attempt to evacuate the field; it is our job to push them out.\n\nTwo squadrons of LeR4 - LeLv 42 and LeLv 44 - will conduct the bombing, while two flights of B-239s from LeLv 24 will fly top cover for the bombers. Your two flights will conduct air defense suppression in advance of the main attack, and will be escorted by two B-239s. If all flak is destroyed, you will contribute to covering the bombers during their run and egress if enemy fighters are present; otherwise, you will strike ground targets of opportunity.\n\n
