Description 21 August 1941\n\nGround operations are about to begin in the Karelian Isthmus to reclaim our territory from the Soviet Union. In preparation, we must obtain an accurate picture of the disposition of Soviet forces in this sector. You will lead a two-ship flight on a low-level reconnaissance over the Soviet airfield at Suur-Merijoki and seaplane base at Viipuri. We need to know how many aircraft and of what types the Soviets have at these bases.\n\nStay low and avoid combat if possible. Flak will likely be heavy, and combat air patrols should be expected.\n
