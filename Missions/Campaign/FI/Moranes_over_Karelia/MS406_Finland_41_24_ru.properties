Description 4 September 1941\n\nCommand wants to degrade the Soviets' ability to conduct naval bombing and reconnaissance operations from their forward bases on the Gulf islands. You will fly flak suppression and escort for a Blenheim strike against the airfield on Seiskari.\n\nThere are no reports of fighters based on these islands, so your primary task will likely be to silence whatever flak the Soviets have operational. You may also strafe targets of opportunity once the flak has been suppressed.\n
