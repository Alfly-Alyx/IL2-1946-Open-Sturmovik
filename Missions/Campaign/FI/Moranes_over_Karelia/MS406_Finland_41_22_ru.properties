Description 1 September 1941\n\nThe damage caused by the raid yesterday was not critical, but it did crater the south end of the runway and holed several of our planes that were parked in the southern dispersal area. Repairs are ongoing, so be very careful when taking off and landing, as the construction crews are working near and on the runway.\n\nYou have been flown, along with several other pilots, to the airbase at Helsinki. You will pick up four planes that have returned from the depot after being rebuilt or repaired. On the way back to base you will provide air cover for the coastal defense ship Illmarinen, which has been dispatched to Kotka to provide additional air defense following yesterday's attack.\n\n
