Description 23 August 1941\n\nToday we will strike at the Soviet airstrip at Rompotti. Intelligence has determined that a naval air squadron of the new MiG type fighters are based there. These planes have proven to be an unpleasant surprise, so we are going to try to destroy as many as we can on the ground.\n\nWe have chosen to strike around midday. The Soviets are very predictable, flying one mission in the morning and one in the afternoon. We hope to hit them while they are either returning low on fuel and ammunition, or on the ground preparing for their afternoon flight.\n\nTwo flights will conduct the mission, with the first flight striking targets on the ground while the second provides cover. If necessary, the second flight will conduct ground strikes as well. Surprise is essential, so come in as low as possible.\n
