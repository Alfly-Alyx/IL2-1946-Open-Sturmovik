Description Tiiksj\u00E4rvi, May 1943.\n\nAt last: early summer. The days are getting longer and longer. And there is a hint of warmth in the air.\n\nThe front is still stalemated. Both the Germans and Soviets are obviously concentrating their forces down on the central portion of the Eastern Front. (Soon a colossal contest of arms will take place there.) And we are happy staying where we are, taking no risks.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAnother front patrol.\n\nThe Soviets are getting more and more aggressive in the air, though. They are often performing strikes against our rear areas, or against known artillery positions.\n\nThe front troops are getting a bit angry over the lack of aerial protection.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nRemember to switch skin on your aircraft. It is early summer, and there is no more need for winter camo, right? I recommend that you use this skin on your MS.406: "1Lt Alitalo 1LeLv 28 Solomanni 1943.bmp" by Tchaika.\n
