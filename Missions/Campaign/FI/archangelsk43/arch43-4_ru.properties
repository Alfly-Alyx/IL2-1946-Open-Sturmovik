Description Tiiksj\u00E4rvi, March 1943\n\nThe aircraft you encountered on the last mission were probably US-made "Airacobras". German Intel says that the type is no good, being dumped on the Soviets by RAF because they don't want it themselves. \n\nWell, I don't know. In the hands of a good pilot, this aircraft could probably be quite deadly... \n\nAs you know this is a pretty static front.\n\nGerman forces in Finnish territory launched an offensive against Murmansk in 1941 as part of Operation Silver Fox, and the city has suffered extensive destruction, second only to Stalingrad of all Soviet cities.\n\nHowever, fierce Soviet resistance and harsh geography then prevented the Germans from capturing the city and cutting off the vital Karelian railway line. \n\nNow Murmansk serves as transit point for weapons and other supplies entering the Soviet Union from other Allied nations. Our long-range patrols often attack the railroad, and we perform air-strikes against it.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYes, another strafing attack on the Murmansk-Leningrad Railroad. I know you hate it, but this is orders.\n\nOne of our long-range patrols have pinpointed a large Soviet transport hub on the railroad. It is the small village of Rabocheostrovsk.\n\nYour mission is to strafe it, and cause as much damage as possible.\n\n
