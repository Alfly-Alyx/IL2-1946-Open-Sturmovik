Description Tiiksj\u00E4rvi, January 12 1943\n\nDon't look so grumpy. This isn't the end of the world. It just looks like it.\n\nThe small base here at Tiikj\u00E4rvi is one of the northermost airfields used by the Finnish airforce. (North of us stands the German 20th Mountain Army, who are in charge of the entire front, all the way up to the Ice Sea, and with them the Luftwaffe.)\n\nThis is a quite important base. From it we support most the ground operations of the Finnish Army Corps III. Which for a long time hasn't been too much, as the front here has been pretty much stalemated since early 1942. And there are no signs of this changing anywhere soon.\n\n(But you have of course read about what is happening in Stalingrad right now? Maybe the Germans won't win this war after all?)\n\nMost of our assignments are patrols over the seemingly endless expanses of forests and marshes, often eventless. Or ground attacks against Soviet transports or communications network. Air-to-air combat is pretty rare, but it does happen. So you better keep on your toes!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe have just received an urgent report from one of our recce flights, telling us that a large number of enemy biplane recce aircraft are present at one of the enemy airstrips at Uhtua. As far as we know there is no AA Artillery at this base.\n\nSo go there, fast, and destroy as many as possible.\n\nThis should be a milk run.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1. Don't forget to switch skin before flying, so that you fly in the same livery as your mates. I recommend that you use this skin: "2Lt Myllyla 1LeLv 28 Solomanni 1943.bmp" by Tchaika.\n\n2. As in real life, getting back in one piece is important. So therefore just landing back at your base again is considered to be a secondary mission.\n\n3. Special thanks to Team International who made this map, which I think captures the looks of this part of the world very well!\n
