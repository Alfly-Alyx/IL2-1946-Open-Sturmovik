Description Tiiksj\u00E4rvi, early April 1943.\n\nThat last mission was a success. We had some telegrams from Corps HQ, and they are thanking us for the help we gave that long range patrol. They will probably recommend you for a medal!\n\nSpring thaw continues. It means that ground activities are down even further, and some enemy airstrips are more or less paralyzed by the mud.\n\nAt the same time we have had reports from Intel, telling us that the Soviet airforce has been strengthened on this front as well. And as you can see both their materiel, their pilots and not least their tactics are getting better.\n\nThis is not a turkey-shoot anymore...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nScramble! \n\nWe have just received reports from the front: they have spotted a large enemy formation, coming this way, probably to attack us.\n\nGet airborne and stop them!\n\n
