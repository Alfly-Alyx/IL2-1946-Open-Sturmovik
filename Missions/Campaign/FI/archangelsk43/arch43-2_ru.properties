Description Tiiksj\u00E4rvi, January 22 1943\n\nWell, your combat debut went all right! Our reports tell us that we destroyed some eight enemy aircraft at Uhtua. \n\nI know that you are pretty new on the Morane Saulnier, so just let me remind you of a few things\n\nIn 1934, the Service Technique Aeronautique (Aeronautical Technical Service) of the French Arm\u00E9e de l'Air issued a requirement for a new and completely modern single-seat fighter, with a monoplane layout and retracting landing gear.\n\nMorane-Saulnier's response was the M.S.405, a low-wing monoplane of mixed construction, with fabric-covered wooden tail, but a bonded metal/wood material fixed to duralumin tubing.\n\nPowered by a 860 hp HS 12Y-31 engine, it has a top speed of 489 km/h. Armament consists of a 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS-9 or 404 cannon with 60 rounds, which fired through the piston banks in the engine, and two 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns one on each wing with 300 rounds each.\n\nWhen the Soviet Union attacked us in 1939, France donated 30 MS 406's, as aid. It was modern in 1940, but now they are getting a bit long in the tooth...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe 20mm cannon of the Morane makes it ideal for attacking ground targets that can be hard to knock out with MG's, like tanks or trains.\n\nLike all fighter jocks we actually detest these ground attack missions, because they are often dangerous. But orders are orders.\n\nToday you and a wingman will make a deep penetration over enemy territory, going up the very strategically important murmansk railroad, where most of the lend-lease that comes over the Ice Sea is eventually transported.\n\nThe mission is simple: attack all enemy transort trains that you can find. And come home in one piece.\n\nThis will be a long haul. Good luck.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThat last mission is based on history. On January 12 fighters from LeLv 14 attacked a Soviet airstrip - undefended by AA - where a large number of enemy biplanes had been spotted. During the action eight Soviet aircraft were destroyed.\n
