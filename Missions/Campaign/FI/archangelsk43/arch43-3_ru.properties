Description Tiiksj\u00E4rvi, February 1943\n\nWell, what do you know? A little more than a week ago the 90,000 survivors of the German 6th Army surrendered. Who could have thought that? The Soviets are also advancing from the Don to the west of Stalingrad, and today they took Kursk.\n\nThis could be very bad news for us here in Finland.\n\nLuckily the front here in the north is still very quiet.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis is one of our standard ops. You and a wingman are to patrol the front below Uhtua, and down south.\n\nAs always there is the possibility to stumble on some Soviet aircraft, but don't count on it. Usually nothing happens at all.\n\nBut if you do, there is a strong possibility that you will meet US lend-lease aircraft. Many are shipped in via Murmansk, and deployed on this part of the Eastern Front.\n
