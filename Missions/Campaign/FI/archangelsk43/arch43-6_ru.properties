Description Tiiksj\u00E4rvi, early April 1943.\n\nSpring has finally set in here on the Arctic front. The roads are in a mess, but we are all glad it's not so cold anymore, and we welcome the return of the light.\n\nThe stalemate at the front continues, and we are happy to keep it that way.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nOne of our elite long range recce patrols, that has been doing some sabotage operations against the Murmansk-Leningrad, has gotten into trouble.\n\nSoviet units are hot in their heels, and the patrol have suffered some casualties. Our patrol has spent the night at a lake behind enemy lines.\n\nThis morning one of our sea planes - used for specials ops - are going to ferry their wounded out.\n\nYour task is to protect that sea plane, and see to that it doesn't get attacked. The Ruskies have been using biplane recce aircraft to track the long range patrol, and attack them, and you will probably meet these biplanes.\n
