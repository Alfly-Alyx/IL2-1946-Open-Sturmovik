Description Tiiksj\u00E4rvi, Late March 1943.\n\nAfter the German debacle at Stalingrad the outcome of the war is suddenly unpredictable. The old, overall strategy of Finland will not change, however. It is enhanced: we must not risk our gains and suffer needless casualties by going on the offensive.\n\nWe will hold back, trying to hang on to the terrain we got, hoping for a continued stalemate. (And we will husband our resources carefully, for instance when it comes to fuel  - no more needless flying around.)\n\nAnd here in the Arctic it will probably continue that way. The only action will be in the air...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYet another front patrol. You and a wingman are to patrol the Finnish front below Uhtua.\n\nAttack all enemy aircraft that you stumble upon, but ONLY is the odds are reasonable good. We can't afford to lose men and machines needlessly!\n
