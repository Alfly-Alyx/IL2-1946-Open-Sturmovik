Name        Arctic Moranes, 1943 
Description This is a semi-historical, 9-mission static campaign, set during the first halve of 1943.\n\nYou are a Finnish Fighter Pilot in  LLv28, flying the Morane-Saulnier MS.406. The Operations Area is the arctic front, and one of your main targets is the strategic railroad that runs between Murmansk and Leningrad. And in the air the Soviets are getting stronger and stronger...\n\nRegarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option. Also if you feel confident enough choose the "No Map Icons" option as well. It will give a MUCH more intense game. Regarding rank: start as "Luutnantti".\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have the AAA (All Aircraft Arcade) Mod installed. And the "TIB Archangelsk" map by Team International Brigade, also available on AAA.
