Description Tiiksj\u00E4rvi, early June 1943.\n\nStalemate on the ground, clashes in the air.\n\nThat last patrol was a success. So now you have met perhaps the most feared Soviet aircraft, the IL-2 "Sturmovik". As you noticed it's heavily armoured, but you are flying one of the few cannon armed types that actually can take on the IL-2.\n\nStories about the fight has been circulated in the press. I have a newpaper clipping from the "Helsingin Sanomat". You are soon famous!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nOne long range recce patrol, helped by our SigInt guys, have spotted what they think is the build up of a new Soviet Infantry Division, in a staging area beside a lake.\n\nBombers from LLv 42 will hit that camp area today. Your task is to escort them.\n\nGood luck!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the final mission in this campaign. Thanks for playing it and congratulations for completing it! /Peter K\n
