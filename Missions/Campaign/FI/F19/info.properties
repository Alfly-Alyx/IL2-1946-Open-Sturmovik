Name        F19 - Swedish Volunteers in the Winter War 
Description This is a semi-historical, 8-mission  static campaign, set during the final months of the Winter War.\n\nYou are pilot in "F19", a Swedish Volunteer Air unit, that fought on the side of the Finns in 1940. You will be flying both the J8 "Gladiator" and the B4 "Hart", i.e. the U-2VS. The Operations Area is the Salla sector in Northern Finland. Many of the missions follow history.\n\nRegarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option. Also if you feel confident enough choose the "No Map Icons" option as well. It will give a MUCH more intense game. Regarding rank: start as "Luutnantti".\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have Mods installed. And the "Svir Front" map by Kapteeni, also available on AAA.
