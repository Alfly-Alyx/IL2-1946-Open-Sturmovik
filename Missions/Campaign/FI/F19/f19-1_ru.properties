Description HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\nThe Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a mutual non-aggression pact, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, on August 23, 1939. The pact also included a secret clause allocating the countries of Eastern Europe between the two signatories. Finland was allocated to the Soviet "sphere of influence".\n\nIn the autumn of 1939, after joining Germany in the attack and occupation of Poland, Stalin made big territorial demands on Finland, and when the Finns refused, the Soviet Union invaded - on November 30th.\n\nBoth Stalin and the Red Army expected this to be a fast and easy victory, but to the surprise of them and the whole world, the Finns at first resisted the invasion successfully, although the odds were completely against them. (The Soviet forces had 4 times as many soldiers, 30 times as many aircraft and 200 times as many tanks.)\n\nBecause of the old, historical ties to Finland, Sweden, which had declared itself to be a non-belligerent rather than a neutral, contributed military supplies, cash, credits, humanitarian aid and some 8,700 Swedish volunteers prepared to fight for Finland. \n\nOne of these voluntary units was the "F19", a Swedish volunteer air units, in action from January 7 1940. It was equipped with 12 Gloster Gladiator II fighters, five Hawker Hart bombers, and eight other planes -  amounting to one third of all the Swedish Air Force's fighters at that time. \n\nThey were used in northern Finland, which up until that time had had practically no air units as defense against the Soviet aerial attacks.\n\nAt the same time the Swedish Volunteer ground unit, with some 8,400 men, began relieving five Finnish battalions at the Salla-Kemij\u00E4rvi-M\u00E4rk\u00E4j\u00E4rvi sector in mid-February. Together with three remaining Finnish battalions, the unit faced no less than two Soviet divisions. \n\nThe overwhelming Soviet superiority could be balanced by sheer fighting-will, an extremely low temperature plus the fact that the highly mechanized Red Army units were largely confined to areas that could be reached by road.\n\nBRIEFING\nWelcome to "Oscar", one our forward operations air bases, and the one closest to the fighting.\n\nToday the Swedish Volunteer Air Corps, F19, will have its baptism of fire. The Russians doesn't even know we are here, so we hope to give them quite a surprise!\n\nThe target is the Red Army concentrations in M\u00E4rk\u00E4j\u00E4rvi, just a short distance behind the front lines. There Ivan has a big staging area for troops, vehicles, supplies and even some air assets, to use against our brothers in arms.\n\nToday we will hit them. You will fly a B4 Hart.\n\nWe have two small problems though. \n\nFirstly: due to problems with ice and the bomb attachment points the take-off has been much delayed. The sun is already sinking. Instead of doing an attack from several directions at once, we only have time for a joint direct approach.\n\nSecondly: we hoped to use all our J8 Gladiators, but four of them has just been forced to take off, to intercept some Soviet bombers. (F19 has also the responsibility of providing the small towns and communications here in Northern Finland with protection.)\n\nOff you go! Hit them hard! \n\nLycka till!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1. As there is no Hawker Hart in IL-2 (the plane called B4 by the swedes) the U-2VS will have to fill that role. Both the looks and the prestanda is pretty close.\n\n2. Don't forget to switch aircraft skins before you fly! Also don't forget to switch PILOT skins. The winter of 1940 was very cold, and the pilot flying in open cockpits were of course using very warm clothing, including special leather masks that covered their faces. With this campaign comes one pilot skin in winter clothing and a leather face mask. Choose this "Leather_mask" pilot skin in the customization menu.\n\n3. As most missions in this campaigns this mission is based on history. On January 12th 1940 four B4 Hart's and 4 J8 Gladiator's attacked the big Soviet base area  at M\u00E4rk\u00E4j\u00E4rvi. Soviet vehicles and troops were attacked with bombs and by strafing, and four Soviet biplane fighters were destroyed: three on the ground, one in the air. The Swedish losses were hefty, though: three of the four B4's were lost.\n
