Description NOTICE!\nThis is the same mission as the preceding one, only that in this one you get to fly the J8 Gladiator!\n\nBRIEFING\nWelcome to "Oscar", one our forward operations air bases, and the one closest to the fighting.\n\nToday the Swedish Volunteer Air Corps, F19, will have its baptism of fire. The Russians doesn't even know we are here, so we hope to give them quite a surprise!\n\nThe target is the Red Army concentrations in M\u00E4rk\u00E4j\u00E4rvi, just a short distance behind the front lines. There Ivan has a big staging area for troops, vehicles, supplies and even some air assets, to use against our brothers in arms.\n\nToday we will hit them. You will fly a J8 Gladiator. Your main mission is to protect the B4 Hart light bombers, but whenever given the opportunity we want you to strafe ground targets of opportunity!\n\nWe have two small problems though. \n\nFirstly: due to problems with ice and the bomb attachment points the take-off has been much delayed. The sun is already sinking. Instead of doing an attack from several directions at once, we only have time for a joint direct approach.\n\nSecondly: we hoped to use all our J8 Gladiators, but four of them has just been forced to take off, to intercept some Soviet bombers. (F19 has also the responsibility of providing the small towns and communications here in Northern Finland with protection.)\n\nOff you go! Hit them hard! \n\nLycka till!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1. Don't forget to switch aircraft skins before you fly! Also don't forget to switch PILOT skins. The winter of 1940 was very cold, and the pilot flying in open cockpits were of course using very warm clothing, including special leather masks that covered their faces. With this campaign comes one pilot skin in winter clothing and a leather face mask. Choose this "Leather_mask" pilot skin in the customization menu.\n\n2. As most missions in this campaigns this mission is based on history. On January 12th 1940 four B4 Hart's and 4 J8 Gladiator's attacked the big Soviet base area  at M\u00E4rk\u00E4j\u00E4rvi. Soviet vehicles and troops were attacked with bombs and by strafing, and four Soviet biplane fighters were destroyed: three on the ground, one in the air. The Swedish losses were hefty, though: three of the four B4's were lost.\n\n
