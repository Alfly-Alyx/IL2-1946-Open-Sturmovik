Description Late February 1940, Forward Operations Base "Oscar".\n\nWe are holding here at Salla, because the Red Army is pretty passive now, but at the same time the front on the Isthmus is slowly crumbling. The Swedish troops will replace Finnish batallions that are rushed south. \n\nThese are truly black days for Finland, fighting her lonely struggle against the whole might of Stalins Soviet Union. If we don't get some more foreign help soon, we will have to sue for peace!\n\nBRIEFING\nHQ is planning a minor counter-stroke here at Salla, but before the ground troops start moving they want us to take out a well-placed battery with heavy howitzers. It was recently was set up just behind the front lines, and is harassing us badly.\n\nIn this mission you will fly a J8A and escort two B4 Hart's that will do the actual ground attack. You will all fly at dusk, to get some cover by the darkness.\n\nLycka till!\n\n*************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1. This is the final mission in this campaign!\n\n2.
