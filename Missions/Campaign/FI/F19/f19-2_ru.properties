Description Mid January 1940, Forward Operations Base "Oscar".\n\nThat big attack on M\u00E4rk\u00E4j\u00E4rvi was a success, but the losses the B4's suffered has made HQ order a temporary ban on further B4 attacks in daylight. (We expect a new B4 Hart from Sweden as a replacement.) \n\nBRIEFING\nOne of the tasks given to F19 is to provide aerial protection for the small towns and communications here in Northern Finland. Previously Soviet bombers from BAP 31 and BAP 57 in Uhtua have been able to operate without any hinder. But this will change now.\n\nThis morning the main city in this region, Rovaniemi, was bombed once again. Take a wing man and go up on a patrol, and see if you can catch them when they return home.\n\nYou will fly this mission in a J8 Gladiator.\n
