Description Mid February 1940, Forward Operations Base "Oscar".\n\nOur front still holds. The attacks of the Soviets show signs of weakening. They still attack our troops in the front lines with air units, bombing and strafing them.\n\nThe news from the Carelian Isthmus are not encouraging. The renewed Soviet offensive there is slowly making progess, by sheer weight. Our troops are gravely outnumbered, with batallions sometimes facing whole divisions.\n\nBRIEFING\nWe want you to make a deep fighter sweep over enemy territory, to make them understand that they can be attacked anytime now. Hopefully you will also catch some Soviet aircraft. And if you do: shoot them down!\n\nYou will fly this mission in a J8 Gladiator.\n\nLycka till!\n
