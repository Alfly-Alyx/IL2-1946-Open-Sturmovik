Description Mid February 1940, Forward Operations Base "Oscar".\n\nThe front at Salla still holds. There are no renewed Soviet attacks at this sector. \n\nBut the bad news keeps coming from the Carelian Isthmus. The Red Army has finally penetrated our front there, at L\u00E4hde, and our troops are retreating towards a fall-back position\n\nBRIEFING\nWe have just been reached by reports from our forward air spotters, that some enemy heavy TB-3 bombers  have crossed the front lines.\n\nSee if you can find them.\n\nThere is just one Gladiator available right now. You will have to do this alone!\n\nLycka till!\n
