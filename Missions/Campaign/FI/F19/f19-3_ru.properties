Description Late January 1940, Forward Operations Base "Oscar".\n\nThis has been one of the coldest winters in at least fifty years. Temperatures of minus 40 \u00B0C are not unusual. The Finns have been able to use this to great advantage. (But we all have to pilot our open cockpit aircraft with leather masks on our faces.)\n\nThe Soviet troops are ill equipped for arctic warfare, lacking in warm uniforms and even tents. They are suffering terribly from frost-bite. Also their tanks and trucks and other mechanical equipment often freeze up and get stuck in the snow drifts, while our troops move swiftly on skis.\n\nBoth our snipers and also our aircraft often target field kitchens (which are crucial for survival in the cold weather) and have bcome quite adept at picking off Soviet troops huddled around huge camp fires.\n\nBRIEFING\nThis will be another raid to attack Soviet troops, stuck in the cold without any tents, with their transports iced up. Often you can spot these gatherings of freezing Red Army soldiers from afar.\n\nJust by these harassment bombings we often force them to extinguish their fires, leaving them to die a slow death in the cold night...\n\nYou will fly a B4 Hart in this mission. You will have a wing man with you.\n
