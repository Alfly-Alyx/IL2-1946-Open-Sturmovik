Description The Svir River Front, Late Summer of 1942.\n\nEarly this morning Soviet Bombers made a raid on \u00C4\u00E4nislinna, mostly aiming for the railway and the railway installations - a transport hub for all our supplies on the Svir Front.\n\nDamages were not too big.\n\nBut now we have just received word, from our airraid pickets on the Front line near the Onega, that an even bigger force has penetrated our air space, obviously aiming for \u00C4\u00E4nislinna.\n\nThey appear to be escorted.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis raid must be stopped. Or we must at least punish them with heavy casualties.\n\nGet airborne quick, fly north and try and intercept them - either going to or, most likely, going from the raid.\n\nWe will send up most our fighters, going in two waves.\n\nMake them pay! Good luck!\n
