Name        Karelian Hawks 1942 
Description This is a semi-historical, 10-mission  static campaign, set during the Summer and early Autumn of 1942.\n\nYou are Finnish Fighter Pilot in LeLv32, flying the Curtiss Hawk A75. The Operations Area is Eastern Karelia. After the hard battles of last year, a stalemate has been reached along the river Svir. As in history you will face a Soviet air force that slowly but surely is growing stronger and stronger.\n\nRegarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option. Also if you feel confident enough choose the "No Map Icons" option as well. It will give a MUCH more intense game.\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have the AAA (All Aircraft Arcade) Mod installed. And the "Svir Front" map by Kapteeni, also available on AAA.
