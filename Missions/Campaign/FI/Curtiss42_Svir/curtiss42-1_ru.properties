Description The Svir River Front, early summer of 1942.\n\nWelcome to Nurmoila and LeLv32!\n\nI understand you are one of the new pilots, to replace the ones we lost this spring, when LeLv was stationed on the Carelian Isthmus, and also participated in the big Hogland operation.\n\nNow we have been transferred to the Svir front, to get a bit of rest I guess.\n\nI want to fill you in on the strategic situation. In December 1941, our advancing troops reached the River Svir - which, as we all know, connects the southern ends of Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega and also marks the southern border of East Karelia. \n\nBy the end of 1941 the front stabilized here, and we dug in, and haven't conducted any major offensive operations since.\n\nI think that the strategy is simply to wait out the end of the war between Germany and the Soviet Union here.\n\nSo you understand: this is a pretty quiet front. If long, eventless patrols bore you, then you won't like it here. Now and then Ivan make some incursions, but they have been few and far between.\n\nBut we still have to keep sharp. Just in case.\n\nRight now we are based here in Nurmoila, together with LeLv 12, wich is a mixed squadron, doing mainly recce duties. We often have to escort them. Another thing: Nurmoila is close to the front, which means that Ivan sometimes pays us a visit...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis is just a familiarization flight, so you will see the part of the front that is the responsibility of LeLv 32.\n\nOne simple ground rule: don't fly into enemy territory unless you have been given orders to do so. The enemy AA Artillery is to be respected at all times. We can't afford to lose aircraft needlessly. \n\n*************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nRemember in order to fly the historically correct livery for this campaign, you will probably have to switch skin. To do this first go to the "Arming" menu, then from that menu on to the "Aircraft customization" menu, and there, select an appropriate skin. I recommend "CU582_44.bmp" by IMME / IFE.\n
