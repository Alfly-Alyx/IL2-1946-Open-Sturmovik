Description The Svir River Front, early autumn of 1942.\n\nI just got a cable from 4th Division HQ, where they thank us for that balloon busting! Without that balloon to help their FO's the Soviet artillery fire soon slackened, and has not had the same precision since. (And there has been no attack following that artillery duel.)\n\nKeep this up, and you will sooner or later be made into a Mannerheim Knight, just like my...\n\n...what?\n\nYOUR MISSION\nScramble, scramble!\n\nEnemy aircraft are approaching our airfield, and they are coming FAST! Perkele!\n\nGet airborne, and STOP THEM!\n
