Description The Svir River Front, Early autumn of 1942.\n\nThe front is all quiet again. At least on the ground. But in the air the Soviet activity has increased. Our SigInt guys thinks there are some new RKK units in this sector. Maybe that's the explanation.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYes, it's time for another patrol.\n\nWe want you to take a wingman and once again make a sweep up and down the river. \n\nBeacuse of the increased enemy activity the size of the standard patrol has been doubled.\n\nAttack all enemy aircraft that you stumble upon.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the final mission in this campaign. Thanks for playing it and congratulations for completing it - that is, if you do.\n\nAnd a special kudos to Kapteeni, of the AAA Forum, who is the one who made this map that you have been flying over!\n
