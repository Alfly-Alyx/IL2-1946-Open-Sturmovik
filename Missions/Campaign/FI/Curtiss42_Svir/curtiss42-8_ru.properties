Description The Svir River Front, Late Summer of 1942.\n\nThe Soviet Raid on \u00C4\u00E4nislinna last week was heavy, and caused a lot of damages, but we took a heavy toll on the attackers. They dropped like flies, didn't they?\n\nWell done.\n\nWe have a new assignment for you.\n\nSomething is happening at the otherwise quiet front. Soviet artillery activity is increasing opposite the fortified position "Swallow". They have started daily bombardments of our positions, some of them quite heavy. We don't know if this is just harassment or what.\n\nAnyway, the big problem is that they now have a spotter balloon there, making it possible for their Forward Observers to direct fire into our rear, against marching troops, moving vehicles, etc, making all kind of resupply difficult.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe want you to take out that Spotter Balloon. Shoot it down. Mind you: it will be heavily protected by AA guns.\n\nWe also think it would be great if you could try and spot one or two of the Soviet artillery batteries that are shooting at our lines. It would be a big help for our counter-battery fire.\n\nAlso: if you see any enemy spotter planes: let them have it!\n\nGood luck!\n
