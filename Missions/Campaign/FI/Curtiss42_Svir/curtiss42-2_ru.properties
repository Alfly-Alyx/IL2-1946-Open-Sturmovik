Description The Svir River Front, early summer of 1942.\n\nWell that was a dramatic introduction to this front! Most of the time the patrols are uneventful, even boring. Both we AND the Russians doesn't put too high a priority on this part of the war. Well, not as long as the Germans are advancing in south Russia, as they are right now.\n\nSo you can still expect a pretty uneventful service.\n\nYOUR AIRCRAFT\nI know you are trained on this aircraft, but I still want to remind you of some basic facts.\n\nThe Curtiss Hawk 75A is an American design, roughly equl to the Hawker Hurricane and the Messerschmitt Bf 109, one of the first fighters of the new generation  sleek monoplanes with extensive use of metal in construction, powerful piston engines and heavy armament (6x 7.5 mm machine guns).\n\nWe have recently bought our Curtiss Hawks from the Germans, who has captured them from the French - and some from the Norwegians. The performance of the Curtiss is actually quite good:\n\n    * Maximum speed: 518 km/h\n    * Cruise speed: 420 km/h\n    * Range: 1,046 km\n    * Service ceiling: 9,860 m\n    * Rate of climb: 13 m/s\n\nWith this one you have a weapon that will surpass almost anything the Soviets can throw at you!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis is an unusual one. Early this morning Soviet fast attack boats made a raid against \u00C4\u00E4nislinna, and created quite a lot of havoc, before quickly withdrawing. They have also just attacked one of our smaller installations south of \u00C4\u00E4nislinna.\n\nHQ want you to get airborna ASAP, and fly over the Onega and try and find the raiders. If you can, strafe them, but the main point is just to SPOT them, for our bombers will try and finish them off later.\n\nWe suspect that they have set up a small naval base somewhere behind their lines, east of Svir.\n\nWatch out: expect a lot of AA Artillery fire.\n\nHurry!\n
