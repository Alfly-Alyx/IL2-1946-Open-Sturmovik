Description The Svir River Front, Summer of 1942.\n\nThat low level attack we suffered a week ago was a very nasty surprise. Ivan is getting more active, and more aggressive - they must have a new commander.\n\nThey inflicted some damage on the ground, and rocked our sense of being almost invulnerable. It figures: the front is nearby, so they can reach us quickly.\n\nWe must be more alert, and patrol more vigorously.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe have it from our skilful SigInt that the Soviets are rotating their troops in the front line. Late this afternoon several transport trains with men and equipment will pull in at a small town in the Soviet rear.\n\nThis is an opportunity to good to miss.\n\nBoth we and Moranes from Lelv 28 will make a deep penetration - at low level - and hit those trains.\n\nYour main task is to protect the Moranes, while they do most of the train busting (their 20mm guns are ideal for this). But if you are given the opportunity feel free to do some strafing yourself.\n\nBut mind you: be pretty certain that Soviet fighters will rise to the occasion!\n\nRadio silence is mandatory!\n
