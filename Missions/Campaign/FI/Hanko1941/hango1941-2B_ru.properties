Description June 26, 1941.\n\nSo now we are once again at war with the Soviet Union. This time bit more on our own terms.\n\nOur troops have not yet started any attacks against the Soviets. There is clearly a Finnish build-up going on. I wonder where our Army will strike first: Karelia or the Karelian Isthmus. Or down south, at Hango?\n\nThe Soviets have turned the Hango Peninsula - that before 1940 was a popular spot for summer vacations, not least for people from Helsinki, that is less than 100km away - into a fortified naval base, defended by crack troops.\n\nThe plan seems to be to wait it out, as an all-out attack on Hango would probably be very costly. (This is despite a rumor that Hitler himself want to have Hango captured ASAP.) There are some fierce artillery duels going on down there, and aggressive patrolling, but no major assaults.\n\nWe, with help from the Germans, will try and starve Hango into submission.\n\nThe base has to be cut off from reinforcements and supplies. There is where we come in...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday you and a wingman are going to patrol the waters aroung Hango, trying to spot enemy shipping trying to get into (or out of) their base there. You spot them, and then we send some of our bombers to finish them off, all right?\n\nPlease make positive ID's. We don't want another Friendly Fire Incident, like the other day...\n\nWatch out for roving enemy fighters. The Soviets have an airbase on Hango.\n\nAh, yes: and stay clear of Hango itself! At least for now. The peninsula and especially the area around the town and harbour is bristling with AA guns. Don't get yourself shot down needlessly.\n
