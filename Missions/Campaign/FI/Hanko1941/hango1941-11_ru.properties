Description Mid November, 1941.\n\nThe Sea is still open, and we know for a fact that the Russians are pulling units out of Hanko, evacuating by ships in the cover of darkness. (Some of them have obviously struck mines, though. Bodies have been floating ashore for days.) But their front is still holding remarkably well, and they show no outward signs of letting up there - strange. But you know how tenacious these Russians can be when on the defensive, and with a gun-toting commissar in their back.\n\nThere are also reports of them blowing up facilities inland, including gas storages and hangars at the airfield. But despite this HQ maintains that the Russians are trying to hold on to Hanko.\n\nWe have had some solid Intel telling us that they will in an hour or so send a transport aircraft out of Hanko, probably carrying some high ranking officers or other VIP's.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYour mission is to take out that transport aircraft. Go with your schwarm and attack it! Look out for the escorts it's bound to have.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1. This is the final mission of this campaign, thanks for playing it and congratulations for completing it! And many thanks to Kapteeni for building this excellent map, without which this campaign could never have been made.\n\n2. Historical note: The last Soviet troops left Hanko on 4/12, and the first Finnish unit in Hanko was in fact Swedish, the 3th Company from a Swedish Volunteer Batallion, already in the night of 3-4/12, despite the fact that the troops were forbidden to go to Hanko. The area was considered dangerous because of timed mines and explosives, similar to those found in Karelian Isthmus.The town was in fact left heavily mined, which despite of precautions caused much damage.\n\nDuring the evacuation of Hanko the Baltic Red Fleet lost destroyers Smetlivyi, Surovyi and Gordyi, minesweepers T 203 and T 206, submarines L 2 and M 98, passenger ships Josif Stalin and Andrei Zdanov, and several smaller vessels. Almost all due to mines. About 23 000 men were transported to Leningrad, but 5 000 men were lost.\n\n
