Name        Siege of Hanko, 1941 
Description This is a semi-historical, 13-mission static campaign, set during the Summer and Autumn of 1941.\n\nYou are Finnish Fighter Pilot, first in  LeLv30, flying the Hurricane, and then in LeLv32, flying Curtiss Hawk A75. The Operations Area is Southwestern Finland, where the Soviet Union is controlling the peninsula of Hanko - as a result of the Winter War. The isolation and crushing of this dangerous enemy base is our first priority.\n\nRegarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option. Also if you feel confident enough choose the "No Map Icons" option as well. It will give a MUCH more intense game. Regarding rank: start as "Luutnantti".\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have the AAA (All Aircraft Arcade) Mod installed. And the "Kt Finland" map by Kapteeni, also available on AAA.
