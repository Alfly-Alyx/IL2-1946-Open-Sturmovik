Description Early October, 1941.\n\nWelcome to Nummela and Lelv 32, detachment H!\n\nSince your unit, Lelv 30, was rotated out of this area, you have been seconded to us, as a sort of liason officer, as we need someone with experience from the Hanko front, to give us some pointers, and also a person capable of flying the aircraft we use, the Curtiss Hawk. And you fit the bill perfectly!\n\nAs you have been on leave lately, I want to fill you in.\n\nWinter has arrived, but it still isn't so cold that the sea has frozen. But that can surely be only a matter of weeks now.\n\nLeningrad is under heavy siege from the Germans, and they have also started pushing towards Moscow again. Some say that this can mean that the war will be over soon. Without a doubt it means that the Hanko enclave is doomed. They are isolated, and no supply ships have been able to reach them for weeks.\n\nStill our HQ wants to avoid a costly assault. But we want to increase the pressure on them!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe want you to take your schwarm and do an aggressive fighter sweep over Hanko, towards their air base. Hopefully they will rise to the occasion, and scramble some fighters. If they do: shoot them down!\n
