Description Late October, 1941.\n\nWell, Ivan still knows how to fend himself. Let that last mission be a lesson to you all: although the pilots of the RKKA in general are rather poor, never underestimate them!\n\nAnyway. we have had indications that the Russians have started to evacuate Hanko! About time!\n\nYOUR NEW AIRCRAFT\nI know you have some training on this aircraft, but I still want to remind you of some basic facts.\n\nThe Curtiss Hawk 75A is an American design, roughly equl to the Hawker Hurricane and the Messerschmitt Bf 109, one of the first fighters of the new generation  sleek monoplanes with extensive use of metal in construction, powerful piston engines and heavy armament (6x 7.5 mm machine guns).\n\nWe have recently bought our Curtiss Hawks from the Germans, who has captured them from the French - and some from the Norwegians. The performance of the Curtiss is actually quite good:\n\n    * Maximum speed: 518 km/h\n    * Cruise speed: 420 km/h\n    * Range: 1,046 km\n    * Service ceiling: 9,860 m\n    * Rate of climb: 13 m/s\n\nWith this one you have a weapon that will surpass almost anything the Soviets can throw at you!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nHQ wants confirmation: is the enemy trying to evacuate Hanko? The weather is appaling - probably why the Russians are doing their move now - but we want you to take a wingman and do a recce, trying to see if there are any Soviet naval vessels trying to break out of Hanko.\n
