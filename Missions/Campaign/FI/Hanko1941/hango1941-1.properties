Description June 25 1941 - Midsummers day\n\nThree days ago Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Everyone thinks it's only a matter of time until we here in Finland are drawn into this epic and brutal struggle. \n\nNo one has forgotten the Soviet invasion in november 1939, threathening our very national existence, starting the Winter War. \n\nThen we pulled through by the skin of our teeth, but were eventually forced to sign a painful peace treaty that has left old Finnish lands in the hands of Stalin.\n\nPerhaps this is a chance for us to regain those lost territories?\n\nYOUR UNIT\nYou are a pilot in Llv 30. It is a Fighter Squadron, now stationed north of Åbo. It is equipped with mostly Fokker D.XXI, plus some Hurricanes. The last type was sent to us by the British during the final days of the Winter War. \n\nYou will be flying a Hurricane. Mind you, we only have four, and due to lack of spares we seldom can use all four at the same time...\n\nWe have already been instructed painted yellow recognition-markers on our aircraft. No one knows why, but the rumor has it that this is the way the German aircraft attacking the Soviet union are marked. You understand?\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe don't have to think about being the ones who will initiate this new conflict, because we have now heard that Soviet air units are hitting towns and airfields all over southern and middle Finland!\n\nThe continuation war has started, and it has started in the air!\n\nA report has reached us that some enemy bombers are approaching Åbo. Take a wing man and see if you can intercept them, either on their way to, or on their way from the target. And shoot them down!\n\n*************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nRemember if you want to fly in the same colours as your mates, you first will have to switch skin. First go to the "Arming" menu, then from that menu on to the "Aircraft custmizaton" menu, and there, select "Black6 Finn HurricaneMkI.bmp". (If you don't, you will automatically fly using the skins you used the last time you flew the Hurricane Mk I.) \n\n\n\n\n
