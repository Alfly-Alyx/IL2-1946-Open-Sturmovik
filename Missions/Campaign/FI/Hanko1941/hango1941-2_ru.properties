Description June 28, 1941.\n\nWhile the German advance in Russia continues, the Finnish front is still quiet - beside a number of artillery duels and air duels. \n\nWe are still keeping a watchful eye on the Soviet Hanko base. Perhaps our Army will storm it soon?\n\nABOUT THE SITUATION\nIn the Moscow Peace Treaty that ended the Winter War on March 6, 1940, Hanko was leased to the Soviet Union as a military base for a period of 30 years. \n\nThe Russians have since turned it into a fortified base, guarding the entrance to the Finnish Bay. \n\nSoviet troops have constructed extensive field fortifications on the landward side of the peninsula and has turned Hanko into a naval base for seaplanes and small naval vessels. And they have renamed it "Gangut".\n\nThey also built an airfield for fighter-bombers at T\u00E4cktom, just outside Hanko, though we know that there is problems with it, being prone to becoming waterlogged in spring and autumn. \n\nThe Russians have mounted artillery pieces on each island to dominate the entrance to the harbour, and they have put a large number of artillery on the peninsula, including three 305mm railway guns, brought from Leningrad.\n\nThe majority of Russian air power in Hanko, apart from a few seaplanes, consisted mainly of I-16 single-seater fighters and I-153 biplanes fighter-bombers, in total, about 60 aircraft.\n\nThe commander of the base is Maj. Gen Seregei E. Kabanov, with Arseni L. Rasskin as political commissar and Commodore Pjotr G. Maksimov as his Chief of Staff. \n\nWe must of course get them out of Hanko. The question is just how, and when.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nTake a wingman and go on a patrol around Hango. Attack any enemy aircraft that you can find. Avoid the enemy air base, though. It is heavily equipped with AA guns, and we can't really afford to lose any aircraft needlessly.\n
