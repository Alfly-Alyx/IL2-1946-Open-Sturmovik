Description Early July, 1941.\n\nIt seems that the plans to retake Hanko by storm has been abandoned, at least for now, because of fear of heavy losses.\n\nBoth sides, while undertaking occasional artillery duel, has for now settled down to static warfare.\n\nOn the seaward side, the picture is different: the sea is the reason that the Russians want Hanko in the first place but the sea was also full of islands and most of those islands are full of Finns. \n\nMany small engagements are being fought in the islands, often by canoe-borne commandos. \n\nABOUT YOUR AIRCRAFT\nConsider yourself lucky: you are flying one of the most modern aircraft in the Finnish Airforce! \n\nThe Hurricane is a low-wing monoplane, powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin liquid-cooled V-12, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of around 500 km/h at 6,400 m. The service ceiling is 10,970 m, the rate of climb 14.1 m/sec. It has a very HEAVY armament: 8 x 7.7 mm Browning machine guns!\n\nThe Hurricane employs a traditional Hawker construction technique from previous biplane aircraft, with mechanically fastened, rather than welded joints. This means that the airframe is heavier than more modernly designed aircraft, but also very durable. \n\nWith its ease of maintenance, widely set landing gear and benign flying characteristics, the Hurricane is know for its reliability, easy handling and also as a good gun platform: the ideal bomber interceptor!\n\nMind you, due to the fuel system the engine doesn't take negative G's to kindly, so avoid them.\n\nFinland bought 12 Mk I Hurricanes at the end of the Winter War, but we lost two during the transit flight. AND we have a big snag with these fine aircraft: due to the scarcity of replacement parts we have problems of keeping them all in the air, and some are getting a bit worn. \n\nThis unit has only five flying Hurricanes, and you can seldom expect a full flight when on a mission.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe are trying to isolate Hanko, and stop any reinforcements or supplies going. For that purpose we are keeping an almost constant patrol of the waters south of the peninsula.\n\nAgain: avoid Hanko proper. Your job is to spot any Soviet boats trying to slip into the base. But if you stumble upon any enemy aircraft, don't hesitate to attack them!\n\n
