Description Early August, 1941.\n\nWe won the battle for Bengsk\u00E4r! It was a battle that escalated on both sides, with both air and naval forces being pulled in. You and your mates helped in a important way!\n\nIn the ensuing battle, during which the defenders were obliged to call in artillery fire from neighbouring islands on their own position, at least 20 members of the original garrison were killed and 17 wounded. Of the various relieving forces, 11 were killed and 28 were wounded. On the Russian side, at least sixty troops were killed (some put the number as high as 120) before the invaders were finally repelled on July 27th. \n\nAs you have all heard: our Army has at last started its offensive in the East, aiming to regain those territories that the Soviets stole from us in the Winter War. Our troops are moving rapidly toward the Ladoga. Horray!\n\nThe situation in and around Hanko hasn't changed in any significant way, though. There are still a lot of skirmishes and patrol actions on the ground, but there are still no signs of our Army going over to the offensive.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nOne of our old Fokker C.X is doing a recce flight over the Soviet defense lines this morning. \n\nThe mission of you and your wingamn is simple: escort that Fokker C.X and see that it can perform its task unmolested!\n\nRendez-vous south of Salo.\n
