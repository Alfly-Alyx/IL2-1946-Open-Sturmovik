Description Late September, 1941.\n\nThe siege of Hanko continues. The skirmishes and actions on the islands have been so bloody that HQ and Mannerheim has called a stop on them.\n\nThis front is more stalemated than ever.\n\nBut still: The Russians on Hanko are surely doomed! We must just watch them, see to it that they aren't supplied, or spirited away. (No Soviet ship has entered Hanko harbour since August, so our blockade is working nicely. Besides: after that costly evacuation of Tallin they can't have much tonnage left can they?\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThere has been very little air activity over Hanko lately, and our patrols have been many, eventless and boring.\n\nToday something is going to happen, though. Some bombers from LeLv6 are going to bomb Hanko harbour today - in order to increase the pressure on the enemy garrison. Your mission is to escort them, protect them from Soviet fighters.\n\nOne word of warning: the bombers are ex-Soviet DB-2's, so don't get triggery-happy and shoot them down, just because the type looks like the ones the enemy uses!\n
