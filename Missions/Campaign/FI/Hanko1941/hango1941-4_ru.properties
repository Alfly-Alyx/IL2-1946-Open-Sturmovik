Description July 26, 1941. Dawn.\n\nWake up, wake up! \n\nSomething is afoot at Bengtsk\u00E4r, you know that tiny island with the lighthouse out in the sea, southsouthwest of Hanko - whicn we have been using as a lookout-post.\n\n(In fine weather, any and all Russian naval movements can be observed from Bengtsk\u00E4r which can direct fire on them from the island of \u00D6r\u00F6 where we Finns have a battery of two 305 mm and four 152 mm coastal guns. )\n\nJust after 1:00 this morning a small flotilla of four Soviet attack boats, landed a number of heavily armed attack squads on Bengtsk\u00E4r.\n\nNow a fierce close combat is raging there, in and around the light-house buildings, for the control of this tiny island.\n\nWe are sending naval reinforcements to the spot (both some gunbots, plus our big cruisers Ilmarinen and V\u00E4inem\u00F6inen - you will pass them). So are probably the Russians. And they will surely send air units too.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nTake two wingmen and fly immediately to area around Bengtsk\u00E4r, providing cover for our ships that are moving there as we speak.\n\nAttack any and all enemy air units that you can find.\n
