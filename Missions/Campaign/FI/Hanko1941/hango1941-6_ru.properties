Description Late August, 1941.\n\nOver at the Carelian Isthmus our troops are advancing on Viipuri, and that old Finnish town will be back in our hands any day now. This war is going according to plan, isn't it?\n\nThe stalemate at Hanko continues, however. The skirmishes are getting bigger and costlier, but the front doesn't move. (We are getting reinforcements: a batallion of Swedish volunteers have moved into the front line.)\n\nStill: something MUST happen. As you heard the Germans are advancing rapidly in Estonia, and the Russians will give up Tallin any day now. And with the Germans in control of the Estonian coast, the Hanko base is A.) isolated and B.) has lost its importance as a lock over the mouth of the Gulf of Finland.\n\nPerhaps they will try and break out?\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe have had reports from German recce aircraft, that at least one Soviet ship is steaming towards Hanko, probably with reinforcements, or just to increase the available tonnage there - in anticipation of a coming evacuation of the base.\n\nThe weather is rotten, but we need you to go up and see if you can find this ship. If you can localize it, our bombers will take it out.\n\n
