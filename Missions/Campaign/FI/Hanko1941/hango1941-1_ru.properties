Description June 25, 1941 - Midsummers day\n\nThree days ago Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Everyone has thought it was only a matter of time until we here in Finland were drawn into this epic and brutal struggle. \n\nNo one has forgotten the Soviet invasion in november 1939, threathening our very national existence, starting the Winter War. Then we pulled through by the skin of our teeth, but were eventually forced to sign a painful peace treaty that has left old Finnish lands in the hands of Stalin.\n\nPerhaps this is a chance for us to regain those lost territories?\n\nBut we don't have to think about being the ones who will initiate this new conflict, because now there are reports of Soviet air units striking towns and airfields all over southern and middle Finland.\n\nThe continuation war has started, and it has started in the air!\n\nYOUR UNIT\nYou are a pilot in Llv 30. It is a newly formed Fighter Squadron, commanded by lieutenant colonel Edvin Nautio. Most aircraft are Fokker D.XXI's, but you are flying British Hawker Hurricanes. \n\nFor now the task of your unit is to protect the southern parts of Finland from enemy incursions.\n\nAlso you must help to keep an eye on the Soviet fortified enclave at the small peninsula of Hang\u00F6 - they have their own air units there. And the ruskies can also reach this part of Finland from their many bases in the Baltic states.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis morning Soviet twin-engined aircraft dropped bombs on the thown to the south of us, \u00C5bo. Now we have reports of more bombers coming this way.\n\nTake a wing-man and see if you can find them, and stop them!\n\n***********************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nRemember to switch skins before flying. To do this go into the ARMING menu, then from that menu on to the AIRCRAFT CUSTOMIZATION menu, and there, select the Finnish Airforce skin of your choice. \n
