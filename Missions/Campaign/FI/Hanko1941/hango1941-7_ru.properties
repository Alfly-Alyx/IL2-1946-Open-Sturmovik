Description Early September, 1941.\n\nOn the Carelian Isthmus our troops has now reached the old border, and they seem to have stopped there. Rumor has it that the Germans are furious that we don't join them in the all-out attack on Leningrad.\n\nThe situation at Hanko? What can I say - still stalemate. Obviously the top brasss are hoping that the Russians will give up the base without a fight, so we won't have to spend a lot of soldiers lives retaking it.\n\nNow they are really encircled, and we don't want a single Soviet soldier to get away!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nTake a wingman and go on a patrol around Hango. As always: report any ships moving, and attack all enemy aircraft that you can find, especially transports. \n\nAvoid the enemy air base, though. It is heavily equipped with AA guns, and we don't want to lose aircraft needlessly.\n
