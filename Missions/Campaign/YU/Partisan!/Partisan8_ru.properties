Name If you don't have what you need, know where to find it
Description Time: 08:00\nWeather: Clear - clouds at 1000M\n\nAh Stavro you're a sight for sore eyes.  Nice veiw from up here, and the Raki - these monks know how to find God, no? Other than the lack of women one could get used to this. Hopefully the war won't last long enough for those goats to start looking attractive, although my wife was just about as hairy, come to think of it.  Ha! As much as you've accomplished with this old U2 -  - do I have a treat for you.  It seems a freighter was docked in Thessaloniki with engine trouble and after much raki with our Greek comrades the crew got very talkative - it seems the ship was bound for Turkey from Spain loaded with arms and munitions - but here is the best part - apparently there are a bunch of packed crates marked as aircraft parts - who know's what's inside - leftovers from the war in Spain no doubt but I'm sure you could make use of them no? The Ship is departing this morning - it's our chance to capture it - You'll fly south east all the way to the Thessaloniki roads - you can follow the west branch of the Vardar all the way to the sea.  You'll see our fishing boats - create a distraction by dropping a few bombs to slow the frieghter down, so we can board it. Don't worry, this old kite can't carry enough bombs to sink it.  Then Proceed to the first village south along the coast from Katerini, called Leptokaria.  Our Greek comrades will take the ship there and see what's inside.  I'll meet you there.\n\nYou'll want to taxi to the northwest end of the village and take off into the southeast wind.  I think it's the only way you'll get this stringbag in the air with those bombs!\n\nPlayer skin: u2Partisan!\n
