Name PARTISAN! Macedonia and Greece 1941
 
Description April 1941 - Yugoslavia is invaded.  Bulgaria annexes nearly all of the southern area bordering Greece, known as Macedonia. The strong autonomist tendencies of the local communists lead to the creation of a sub-army called the People's Liberation Army of Macedonia. From the air, bring confusion and despair to the invaders in support of these partisan brigades fighting on in Macedonia and Greece!                                                                  Player Notes: CHOOSE HIGHEST RANK. In most cases the primary objective is to just make it back alive. The campaign was designed around full real settings.  You can use whatever you like of course, but turn off map icons if you like a few surprises.  I've included a printable map of the area with some key extra locations marked. Th I-A-G map in game is only 1:4 size so it's pretty hard to get lost. Also, I would  turn off "no instant success".
