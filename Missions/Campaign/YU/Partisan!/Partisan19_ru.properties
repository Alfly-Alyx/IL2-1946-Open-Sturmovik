Name The Germans are up to something
Description Time: 07:30\nWeather: Blind - clouds at 1500M\n\nThat was close.  The Germans are definitely restless.  Our Greek comrades tell us there have been reports of a tremendous amount of air and shipping activity into Corinth and Piraeus, despite the weather.  Massive amounts of material, planes and troops assembling.  Fly down there and see if you can tell what is going on - determine types of aircraft in particular. Remember the skies are crawling with Nazis so be careful! You'd best keep it low and fast until you near the Peloponnese.  Keep to the coast and avoid the big Nea Anchialos airdrome, but once past it turn south for Corinth, then circle around to Piraeus before heading home.  \n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
