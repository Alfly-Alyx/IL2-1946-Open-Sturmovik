Name The Colonel's Escape
Description Time: 06:00\nWeather: Fog of War - clouds at 500M\n\nSkopje is surrounded, we're cut off, Prilep is burning - the politicians are wavering - I fear our dream for an independent Macedonia will have to wait for another day.  The Fascists are beginning their final assault on Skopje - it's only a matter of time before it falls - but Stavro - I know I can trust you to take the fight to them until the last breath. The Colonel feels the same - there's been talk of forming a partisan brigade under his command, and melting into the mountains where we will continue to resist.  Stavro - now this is your most important mission yet.  You must fly into the cauldron to evacuate the Colonel.  The only plane we have capable of carrying two is the old U2.  Fly in low, they've improvised an airstrip on a bit of road to the east of the town center- you should see it marked by campfires.  Land, pick up the general and return here.  Oh, and you might as well take a few bombs for the trip in to drop on their rotten fascist heads.\n\nPlayer skin: u2Partisan!\n
