Name A warning given
Description Time: 12:00\nWeather: Hazy - clouds at 1500M\n\nGliders and paratroops!  This can mean only one thing - The Germans are preparing an airborn invasion. But of what? Malta? Cyprus? or Crete! Yes - it must be Crete.  From what you've seen there's not much time.  Our radio communications are being jammed but we must warn what's left of the Greek Army and our friends the Brits still holed up there.  If they have some time to prepare they may just be able to destroy the Nazi bastards before they gain a foothold on the island.  Holding Crete is our only hope of driving the bastards out of Greece and Macedonia.  Fly straight away to Malame airfield near Chania - on the western end of the island, and almost directly due south of Athens - and alert the garrison.  We've rearmed your plane but there's no more petrol - you should just have enough to make it, if you don't run into trouble on the way!  The weather's cleared - so the Luftwaffe is likely out in force - It's a mad dash I know - but if anyone can make it, Stavro you can!  God speed. Oh, and one more thing you should know -  on Crete they call raki "tsikoudia".\n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
