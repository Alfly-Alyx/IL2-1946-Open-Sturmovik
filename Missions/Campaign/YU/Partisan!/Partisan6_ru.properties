Name Escape to the Monastery
Description Time: 06:30\nWeather: Storm/Thunder - clouds at 1500M\n\nStavro...my Comrades, you have served well, but the end is here. The fascists begin the final push even as the politicians all rush to see who can bend over first.  The Colonel's brigade has escaped - and now you need to take what's left of our airforce (the only thing airworthy is this old U2) and fly to the monastery at Gorno Kolicani - you remember where it is no? southwest of Skopje on the mountantop -  They'll never suspect it and what's better the lazy schoolgirls the fascists call an army could never climb it. Without armour they're nothing - one of us with a knife could slaughter a dozen of their infantry like lambs at Easter. If I remember right it's a pretty flat peak. Egon will meet you there with as much ordnance as those old mules will carry. It will be tough but there should be enough room for you to land up there - you're a good pilot, no? Take this radio - we'll be in touch.\n\nPlayer skin: u2Partisan! MARKINGS OFF\n
