Name The Beast awakes
Description Time: 06:45\nWeather: Poor - clouds at 500M\n\nStavro I fear we've been too successful.  The Germans tire of letting the Bulgarians and Italians amuse us by playing at war up here and are sending a reinforced battalion north. They have assembled in Kastoria. Indeed they are a tougher opponent and we can't hold against them.  At least we can occupy them for a bit, though - see how much damage you can do as they have to crowd through the mountain pass on the road to Metsov.\n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
