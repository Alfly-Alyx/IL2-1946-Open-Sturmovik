Name Escape the Fascist Onslaught
Description Time: 07:30\nWeather: Poor - clouds at 1000M\n\nStavro, comrade, The fascist invaders have broken through our lines to the north and east. The airfield is overrun! Escape and do as much damage to the advancing enemy as possible to cover the withdrawal of the last of our units.  We're regrouping in the mountain pass to the west of Skopje, on the road south to Prilep, just past the western bridge over the Vardar river. We'll establish a makeshift airfield on the road. Live to fight another day and I'll see you there.\n\nPlayer skin: i-153partisan!1a MARKINGS OFF\n
