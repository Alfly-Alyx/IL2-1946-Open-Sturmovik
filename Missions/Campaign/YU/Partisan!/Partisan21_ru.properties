Name Escape from Crete
Description Time: 09:30\nWeather: Good - clouds at 1200M\n\nRight, mate. Speak English? Well - it's every man for himself, looks like. We gave 'em hell, must of killed near half of them - not bloody likely they'll have the balls to try something like this again - but since they finally took Maleme there's no way we can hold the rest of Crete. We've blown most of the petrol dump already, but there's some in that barrel over there - you'll have to pump and filter it yourself, though.  Look, if you can get that crate out of here without jerry blasting you a new arse then your welcome to it.  If there's not enough for you to make it to Africa, then I suppose you might find the Illustrious due south of here, steaming east south east, not that you heard it from me, right?  I doubt you've had many opportunities to land on a carrier, crikey, where did you say you were from? but there's a first time for anything, right mate? Bloody hell! That was close!  Sod off you Bastards!!! Allright, then, where was I -  ho, that's it, I'm leaving - Good luck! \n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
