Name Airfield Attack
Description Time: 06:15\nWeather: Hazy - clouds at 1500M\n\nIt seems our little secret is out. They know our little airforce exists, but I don't think they know where our base is, and we can't afford to let them find out.  The Bulgarians have reinforced their airbase east of Metsov with some Dewoitne 520's - we need to hit it before they get too settled.  Also, we are consolidating the brigade in the area of Pogradec and the Metsov airfield is too threatening to our flank.  We need to keep their forces committed and keep them from harassing the brigade.  A dawn wake up call should suit, no?\n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
