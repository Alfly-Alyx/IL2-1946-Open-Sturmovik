Name Outflanked and Outgunned
Description Time: 07:15\nWeather: Good - clouds at 1200M\n\nDamn! The east bridge is gone; a counterattack is no longer possible.  Our position is untenable. And worse, the enemy has somehow managed to place artillery on the heights north of the only bridge we still hold, and our retreating forces are being pounded. Do what you can to suppress that battery until we can withdraw the rest, lest they're cut off. Thank God the bastards have yet to bring any fighters forward to the airfield, they'll have a devil of a time getting it operational again - so let's hit them while we still can. \n\nPlayer skin: i-153partisan!1a\n
