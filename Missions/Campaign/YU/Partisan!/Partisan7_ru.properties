Name Observation Post
Description Time: 20:00\nWeather: Clear - clouds at 1500M\n\nStavro! Do you read me? Come in! - The brigade is consolidating south of here, but they've set up an observation post on a mountain commanding views of all the approaches in three directions.  It's located halfway on a line between Prilep and Metsov.  West about 5 clicks then due south through the valley about 7 clicks. We need it taken out so we can move south past Bitola to the Albanian border without them seeing.  They're probably all passed out drunk around the fire, so they won't hear you coming in that old kite of yours.\nOut.\n\nPlayer skin: u2Partisan!\n
