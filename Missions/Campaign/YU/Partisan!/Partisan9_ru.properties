Name Take your new Toy home
Description Time: 06:30\nWeather: Poor - clouds at 1500M\n\nStavro - good to see you again - My my -  2 I-16s crated up and enough ordinance to blow 10,000 Fascists to smithereens.  A bit worn and beat up - but I don't think the fascists will be paying much attention to how pretty our aircraft are as we deliver them back to their hell. Between you, Boris and these Greek engineers I'm sure you'll figure out how to put them back together. I'll take the rest of the men north with the supplies.  Once the planes are assembled, you and Boris fly them back to the monastery.  We'll meet you there.  Oh, look here, some red and yellow paint- For Macedonia! That should make our little airforce stand out; We want the fascists to know whose on the other end of the gun, no? Don't let the Greeks dissuade you.\n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1 MARKINGS OFF\n
