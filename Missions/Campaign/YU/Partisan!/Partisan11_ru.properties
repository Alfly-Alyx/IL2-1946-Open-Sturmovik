Name The bigger they are the harder they fall
Description Time: 06:00\nWeather: Hazy - clouds at 1500M\n\nWell that was a nice bit of fireworks - now let's see how well these rockets work against aircraft. I know, I know, they're not designed for it, not accurate enough for air to air work, etc etc - but a partisan is nothing if not resourceful, eh? The Italians have been flying pretty regular cargo runs at dawn and dusk across the Adriatic to supply their bases in Tirana - I bet you could bounce one on it's way in, and a big juicy transport should be easy enough to hit with one of these, even for you, Stavro.  They shoudn't know yet about our little secret - there may not even be any escort.  Even if they did suspect, the Italians would never expect that we would operate so far to the west over Albania.  With the state of communication between the Italians and Bulgarians it should be a while before they put two and two together and discover our little airforce, no?\n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
