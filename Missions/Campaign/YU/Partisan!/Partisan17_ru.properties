Name war and Reprisal
Description Time: 14:15\nWeather: Clear - clouds at 1000M\n\nStavro -  Oh Stavro - word has come of their atrocities in Grevena! They're burning Kastoria as we speak and elements of the brigade were surrounded and trapped there.  They take no prisoners! No telling what other horrors they are perpetrating against the innocent!  The Luftwaffe is all over the skies but we need you to get to Kastoria by any means possible and see if you can at least create enough of a diversion to allow what's left of the brigade to escape, and save the villagers from these Nazi criminals!\n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
