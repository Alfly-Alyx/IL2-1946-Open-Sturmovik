Name Fuel Convoy Intercept
Description Time: 10:30\nWeather: Rain - clouds at 800M\n\nFrom the east on the road to Sandaski, the Bulgarian fascists are bringing fuel to supply their new airbase - We'll surprise them with our new toy.  The weather I know is terrible, but all the more they won't expect any attack from the air, and even then they'll asume it was their own shooting at friendlies in the poor visibility.  We need to keep our little secret as long as possible, but I think this is worth the risk.  Pick up the road where it crosses the Vardar south east of here- Cloud cover is low, so you'll have to get underneath it to follow the road at tree top level to find your target.  You'll really be in the soup, Stavro!  Don't worry, we'll have an extra glass of raki when you get back. The road runs roughly parallel to the east branch of the Vardar for about 20 clicks - then takes a sharp turn east for Sandaski - make a wrong turn there and you end up in Thessaloniki! I know, ahem, things here in the monastery can get a bit dull but do try and stick to the task at hand!  We know the convoy departed this morning, so they are out there somewhere.  Good hunting!\n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
