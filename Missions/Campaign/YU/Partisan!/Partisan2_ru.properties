Name Recce over Skopje
Description Time: 17:45\nWeather: Hazy - clouds at 1500M\n\nThat was close.  Skopje for the moment is safe.  However, we are in a perilous position.  We hold two bridges over the Vardar river. The Fascists may threaten the bridge to the east.  If it is captured and we are left with only the one river crossing our planned counterattack cannot proceed and the city will be in danger of being cut off.   The fascists have stalled on the ground and  with night falling I doubt they'll try anything, but one never knows does one?  Weather's improved a bit - Recce the approaches from the east just in case.\n\nPlayer skin: i-153partisan!1a\n
