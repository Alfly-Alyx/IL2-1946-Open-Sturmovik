Description Time: 06:15\nWeather: Poor - clouds at 800M\n\nGood work, Anton - a bloody nose they'll not soon forget - but it's clear they have reinforced the airfield east of Skopje from that scare you got up there, no?  Well, before they can get too comfortable, a dawn attack as they sleep it off, eh?  We've run out of rockets - so we've managed to rig your kite to carry some bombs - it's cloudy so fly in low and fast and hit them hard - any aircraft they have must be out in the open as the hangers were destroyed.\n\nPlayer skin: i-153partisan!1a\n
