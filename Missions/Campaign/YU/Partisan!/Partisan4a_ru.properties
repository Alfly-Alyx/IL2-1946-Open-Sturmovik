Name Prilep Defense
Description Time: 18:00\nWeather: Clear - clouds at 1500M\n\nWell, that was a bit of a surprise - the bastards got the jump on us that time! It's quiet for now - but we can't afford to be caught with our pants down like that again.   We're hearing now that the Italians want to get in the fun.  Well the Greeks beat them pretty bad last year so I doubt they have the stomach for it.  Stavro, I know it's been a long day but we need you for one sortie before it's too dark.  The weathers cleared again, so it should be a bit of a joyride for you. - Southwest as far as the Albanian border, then follow the border south and make sure there's no rats sniffing around - We'll be pulling back to Prilep so we have to ensure our flank is clear. \n\nPlayer skin: i-153partisan!1a\n
