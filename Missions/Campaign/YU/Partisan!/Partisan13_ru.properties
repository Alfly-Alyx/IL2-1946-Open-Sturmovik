Name On the move
Description Time: 12:15\nWeather: Good - clouds at 1000M\n\nThanks to your good work keeping the Bulgarians occupied, the brigade is ready - we've isolated and surrounded the Italian garrison in Pogradec.  It seems we may have bit off a bit more than we can chew though as they have an armor section with them - we don't dare move in for the kill until they are taken out.  You know what to do, Stavro!\n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
