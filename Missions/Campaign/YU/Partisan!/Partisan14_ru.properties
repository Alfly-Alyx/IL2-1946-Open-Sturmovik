Name Airdrop
Description Time: 19:30\nWeather: Clear - clouds at 1500M\n\nIt seem we've finally made an impression on the Britishers - we can hold ground and are causing havoc to the enemy, distracting them from their African adventures.  They have made contact and have committed some support.  They will be parachuting in some of their commandos and material tonight - but we need to disable the radar at Kerkyra and escort them in to Pogradec so they can locate the drop area.\n\nFly southwest over Prilep, then straight over our lines at Pogradec. From Pogradec maintain your heading of 215 to the coast and the island of Kerkyra.  Due west of the cities of Kassiope and Kerkyra is the radar station.  Our Greek comrades have arranged a signal on the coast of the island which you should be able to pick up and it will guide you on a vector to the station.  I'm not sure how they plan to arrange this, but they assure me you'll know it when you see it.  Then proceed to grid AS18 on your map and you should intercept the incoming Brits at near sea level - they are coming in low in case you miss the radar station.  Guide them over the mountains back to our lines for the drop.  Then proceed back to our little mountaintop retreat.  They'll have to find their own way home.\n\n\nPlayer skin: i16type24partisan!mac1\n
