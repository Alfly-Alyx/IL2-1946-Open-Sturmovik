Name Bushpigs 08 Bridge Raid
Short Bridge Raid\n
Description Bridge Raid\n\nThe news of your success against the destoyer preceded your return to base thanks to the efficiency of what Randy referred to as his "Jungle Telegraph". Your whole unit was jubilant at your success and, as the weather precluded any more flying for the day, celebrations were in order. Your kitchen crew prepared a great feast of barbecued Bird of Paradise and Barramundi and, in spite of the heavy rain, the celebration continued late into the afternoon. \n\nThe weather cleared overnight and you arose early and sought out Randy to discuss future operations. He looked as hung-over as you felt and you realised with some horror that you probably smelt as bad as he looked. Such was life in the jungle.\n\nGoing over the maps, it was decided to hit the "highway" again the following day, the objective being the multiple bridges along the route. Their destruction would disrupt the supply line far more efficiently than shooting up random vehicles and troops and, being of wooden construction, they were flimsly enough to be taken out by some well-placed rockets. The thought of flying in your condition made you nauseous.\n\nIn spite of your hangover, the malaria, dysentry, crocodiles, insects, heat, humidity and crotch rot, you were beginning to enjoy this independant command thing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nAs Chook's kite has developed an overheating problem, your fellow pilots this morning will consist of Flight Sergeant Robert "Bashful" Coy in Wombat 01 and Flight Sergeant Frank "Bazza" Barry in Mulga 01. You will proceed to grid AW-7 & destroy as many bridges as you can in grids AW-07 to AZ -07. One pair of rockets will take out a bridge.  Feel free to strafe targets of opportunity on the way to the next bridge but be wary. The weather is good and Tojo is already jumpy. Enemy fighters may not be too far away.\n\nBashful and Bazza will be attacking bridges in their own sectors east of yours. (If you run into bandits, radio the base for help)\n\nNote - You are last to take off.  \n\nTime - 1126hrs\nWeather - Bloody hot & due to all the recent rain, muggier than usual\n
