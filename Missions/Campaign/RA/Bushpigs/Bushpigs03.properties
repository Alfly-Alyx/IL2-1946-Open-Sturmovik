Short Stirring the pot - Raid on enemy camp\n
Description Stirring the Pot\n\nThat night you discussed the run down the "highway" that you had done that afternoon. Although full of fat targets, it was decided that raids on the road would have to be very limited, lest Tojo get jumpy and put up patrols. The idea was to draw as little attention to your base as possible and the last thing you needed was a bunch of Jap fighters dogging your heels.\n\nAfter more bully beef for dinner, you, Randy and his native right-hand man Micari, discussed the various enemy camps around the area. According to Micari there were quite a few of them but, given the size of your force, only 2 were chosen as targets for the next morning. The bigger camp was to be hit with 3 Beaufighters at sunrise and you were to take the remaining Beau and hit the smaller camp some 2 hours later. Everyone would be armed with 500lb bombs.\n\nYou were out of bed by 0400hrs to brief the pilots and see them away.  After they had disappeared into the the pre-dawn gloom and the rumble of their engines had receded, you headed off to find coffee and study the intelligence provided by Randy & Micari's jungle network.\n\nNobby joined you in the radio hut some 30 minutes later. At only 19, he was the youngest of your charges & had joined the RAAF straight out of high school. He was a solid R/AG man and seemed to find life in the jungle to his liking but for the lack of a pub. But it was a long way from his home town of Ballarat. \n\nAs you made your way out to your kite through the oppresive morning damp, you turned to Corporal Clark and gave him an even look.\n"Keep your bloody eyes peeled Nobby . I don't want anything following us home" \n"No worries, skipper" he replied with a grin.\n\nHe really seemed to like this stuff.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nHead along the valley, following the river to the target (NW corner of grid BF-9 on the coast) As you approach the coast, (without having deviated from the river), the base is situated  between the mouth of this river and the next one to the north. You will have surprise on your side hopefully, so line up on the target as early as you can and make ONE PASS ONLY.  Stay below 500 ft for the trip out, dropping to 100 ft for your approach to the target. Extend out to sea & for your return leg, follow the river back to base, once again staying below 500 ft. Should you run into bandits try to outrun them.  Also try the radio for help. Your other pilots should be still in the air and nearby to the base. They may be of assistance.\n\nPark in your revetment in the SE corner of your base for extra points\n\nTime - 07:33hrs\nWeather - Not as hot as it will get today. Just wait.\n
