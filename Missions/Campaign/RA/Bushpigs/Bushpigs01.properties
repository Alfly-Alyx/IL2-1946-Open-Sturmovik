Name Bushpigs 01 Jungle Strip
Short Jungle Strip - Welcome to the bush\t\n\nEscort your supplies and spares to your new forward base. \n
Description Jungle Strip\n\nThe ground staff journeyed out to the new base earlier today and you & the 3 other Beaufighters are escorting the last of the men and equipment in on two C-47s. \n\nThe journey has been long and dull. Your arse has fallen asleep, your joints itch from the constant engine vibration and your sweat-soaked shirt has dried stiff against your skin. The seemingly endless jungle stretches away before you, dark and forbidding,  broken occasionally by the probing finger of a inland waterway. The excitement you felt this morning at the prospect of your first real command has given way to dread this arvo.  Even Nobby has remained oddly silent.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou are still about 60 km from your base (SW corner BC/8) . You must wait for the C-47s to land and disappear from the runway before you attempt yours. The strip is narrow, short and difficult to  spot. Lining up on the centreline is very important so do not be afraid to go around. Fly over and take a good look while you wait for the C-47s to land. Watch them land as this will give you a good idea of the aspect of the strip (The A.I. Beaufighters will not land so do not wait for them) (ANY BUSHES THAT DO APPEAR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RUNWAY DID NOT APPEAR DURING THE FMB PROCESS-IGNORE THEM AS THEY CANNOT HARM YOU............UNLESS YOU EAT THEM OR JAB YOURSELF IN THE EYE WITH ONE OF THEIR BRANCHES...)\n\n**AIR START**\nAltitude - 1500m (5000ft)\nSpeed - 400kph (250mph)\nHeading - approx 090 degrees\n\n\n
