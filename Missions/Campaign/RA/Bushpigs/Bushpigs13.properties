Description Spindrift\n\nCorporal Toby Beveridge was from Mount Gambier, a picturesque town near Blue Lake in South Australia. His father was a popular town publican and Toby, as the eldest son, was being groomed for the hotel industry.  But much to his mother's sorrow and his father's chagrin, he enlisted in the RAAF in 1940, the day of his birthday. He found life in the service interesting, if sometimes difficult, but he enjoyed his job as a radio telegraphist and appreciated the fact he was not fighting on the ground.  A loud sergeant had bestowed the inevitable nickname of "Milo" upon him sometime during his initial training at Parkes and he carried it like a badge of honour. Slightly-built, bookish and somewhat shy, he was well-liked and in most ways, unremarkable.\n\nPilot-officer Robert "Bashful" Coy, had been working as a clerk for the Commonwealth Savings Bank in Brisbane when the hostilities began.  His future within the bank looked quite bright as the whole industry restructured itself in preparation for a wartime economy.  But Bashful, like so many young men at the time were taken with the stories of honour and comraderie that their fathers and uncles had brought back from Gallipoli.  The outbreak of war was an opportunity to partake in something similar and, overlooking the horror stories that his father had also related, he joined up in 1939.  He was only an average pilot but he made up for any shortfalls in skill with his tenacious drive.  A keen rugby player during peacetime, he was tall and broadly-built and his physique seemed to attract trouble whenever he went on leave.  Almost without fail, he would return in the company of MPs having been at the centre of some brawl, drunken or otherwise.  These skirmishes had cost him promotions and had left him bitter towards the brasshats & the other services. \n\nThese 2 men were very different from each other and, had they met during peacetime, would not have had much to say to each other.  War though made for strange bedfellows.  Bashful & Milo got on like a house on fire.\n\nAs they pulled Milo ashore, his only concern was for his skipper. Although his right leg was shattered, the femur punched through the skin like a broken pipe and his face a ruined mess, a flap of skin hanging over his left eye that sat unseeing in a fractured eye socket, he groped for Randy's hand as he hunkered down beside him. A medic was busy trying to treat the injuries.\n\n"Where's Basher?" he gasped.  "Did he get out?" Randy took his hand as he coughed up blood and dirty river water.\n"He'll be okay Milo," Randy answered, not unkindly. "So will you.....and you'll get to go home for a while. See your family...clean sheets....hot water....." \nThe medic administered morphine but Milo didn't seem to notice.  Instead he grinned up at Randy, bloody gums and broken teeth.\n"Cold beer?.....Girls?"\nRandy returned the smile as best he could.\n"Yeah mate. Cold beer and girls. Whatever you want...."  He paused as Milo was wracked by another bout of coughing.  "What was the word from HQ Toby?" he asked once the coughing fit passed.  "What did they say?"\nMilo's good eye cleared as he fought the effect of the morphine.\n"24 hours."  He looked at Randy intently. "Transports, the whole lot...By this time tomorrow......we're all going home."  He smiled again at this and then his face relaxed, the morphine taking hold. \n\nRandy looked over his shoulder towards the tail of the crashed Beaufighter jutting skyward from the centre of the river from amongst a growing slick of fuel.  Micari and 2 of his men were swimming away from it dragging a shapeless mass.  Catching Randy's unasked question, Micari solemly shook his head.  The shapeless mass was Bashful's corpse.\n\nWhen Randy looked back at Milo, the young airman had lasped mercifully into unconsciousness.\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe whole group remained edgy all night and by morning Milo had succumbed to his wounds. After a sombre service you had Milo and Bashful buried beside one another behind their empty revetment.\n\nUnable to sustain 3 aircraft in the air at a time for a whole day, you decided to rotate the crews on CAP for 4 hours at a time with the other 2 crews on immediate readiness. Bazza had the 1st patrol, with Chook taking the 2nd one and you the 3rd. \n\nChook was halfway through his patrol when, shortly before noon, reports came in from one of Randy's patrols that the Japs were making a move from the south. \nWhilst Davo and his men armed the 2 Beaufighters with rockets, you studied the enemy approach on the map..... \n\nTake off and cirle the base in a clockwise direction allowing Bazza to form up. The last report put the enemy troops in grid  BC-6 (west)  moving north-west along the northern bank of the river - the path of least resistance. Find them and attack anything that moves. \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nPark back in your revetment when you return to base for extra points\n\nTime - 1147hrs\nWeather - It seems hotter than ever...and your crotch is very itchy. The heat doesn't help.\n
