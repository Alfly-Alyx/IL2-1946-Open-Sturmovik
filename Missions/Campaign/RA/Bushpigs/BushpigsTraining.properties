Short Practice for T/O and Landing for the narrow, short jungle strip\n
Description G.C. Glasscock has given you 3 days to get your affairs in order before you leave for your new post. Tracking down one of the transport pilots who had already made the trip to the base, you pumped him for information on the place. Heat, humidity, snakes, insects...all scarey stuff. But the Flight Sergeant grew pale when he described landing his Dakota on the strip, scant feet seperating the treeline from his wingtips. In a shaking voice he stated that while the actual strip was long and wide enough for operations, it left absolutely no room for error. Any variation off the centre line of the runway had you eating jungle. \n\nYou pondered this as you made your way back to Schwimmer Field, collecting your radio/airgunner, Corporal Kevin "Nobby" Clark from one of the local watering holes along the way.\n\nAlthough the Beaufighter was smaller than the C-47, it also had to take off and land at much greater speed. It seemed that some serious landing and take-off practice was needed in order to operate from this short jungle strip. \n\nSetting up a short strip parallel to the main runway, you had a sergeant from the motor pool line it with whatever vehicles he could get his hands on to put pressure on you and your pilots. Risky yes. But war was a risky business and you had a feeling this would be the tamest thing you would do in the upcoming weeks.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nTake off and land on the parallel practice strip on the north-east side of the airfield without damaging your aircraft. Approach from the north-west. Practice turning around and taking off again as you will need to taxi in confined spaces at the new base as well. Do this as many times as you like. The other pilots from your "squadron" will practise later.\n\nTime - 1503hrs\nWeather- Good\n
