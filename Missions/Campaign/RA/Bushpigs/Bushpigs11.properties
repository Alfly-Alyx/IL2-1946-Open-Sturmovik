Description Intercept\n\nAs the base got busy recovering supplies & mail from the drop zone, you watched as Randy prepared for his raid on the survivors. \n\n"I'll know better once I see the camp," he said going over his gear for the night's op, "But I have my doubts as to whether they were there by chance." You nodded in agreement as he slung his Owen over his back & checked his HAC revolver, machette and survival knife. "I should be back after 0200." \n\nHe grinned as he stepped out of his hut. Micari and a dozen or so other men waited for him outside, half-naked native blokes carrying spears, knives and an odd assortment of allied and enemy firearms. A dangerous-looking group of fellas.  Randy addressed them all briefly in Pidgin-English and as they melted into the jungle, you raised your arm & wished them luck. \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe next afternoon, after checking on Bashful's recovery, you joined Randy in his hut to discuss the future of your base.  From the gramophone, Jack Lumsdaine finished a scratchy farewell to Phar Lap and was replaced by Don Bradman singing about rainbow days. Randy handed you a scotch as you sat down on an upended ammo box.\n"I forgot he recorded that song", you commented, nodding towards the gramophone. You swallowed your shot of scotch and held it to Randy for a refill. "When was that? Thirty three?"\nRandy shook his head as he splashed more scotch into your glass.\n"Thirty", he answered. "A lifetime ago." Taking a long pull from the bottle in his hand, he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand & gestured to the map on his radio table.\n"I wasn't able to learn much last night. The Japs that were still alive when we moved in didn't feel like being taken alive", He paused, lighting a cigarette with his Zippo."And I really wasn't interested in losing anybody to achieve that. From the bumpf I was able to recover it seems they were on a patrol to scavenge for supplies.... which could mean anything. Food, entertainment, labourers.....",  he trailed away & cocking his head, reached over to the gramophone & lifted the pick-up arm. Bradman was cut off in mid-chorous & as soon as the music stopped you heard it too. Faint but distinct. Aero engines. \n\n"Chook and Bazza coming back?" you suggested. You had sent them on a patrol up the river to see if there were any troops following the group you had attacked the day before. Randy was slowly shaking his head even as you spoke.\n"No", he said as he walked to the door and squinted into the sky to the south. "It's too loud for a Beau," Grabbing your Owen, you followed him out. Bashful was outside, still obviously weak from the malaria, also squinting southwards. He looked at you for direction.\n\n"Pass the word to the gun crews to hold their fire", you called to him. " And get everything under camo nets." As Pilot Officer Coy lumbered away, you grabbed the binoculars from inside the hut and rejoined Randy outside.  Through the glasses you could make out a twin-engined aircraft approaching from the south at about 2500ft. The meatballs on the wings were clearly visible. \n"Maybe he won't see us", you murmured without much hope. Randy raised an eyebrow at you but said nothing.\n\nYou both watched the Jap aircraft as it passed across you base, slightly to the west. You followed it with the field glasses until it was hidden again by the trees. Removing the binoculars, you looked down to see Nobby standing nearby, kit in hand. Davo already had his men removing the camo netting from your Beaufighter and turning over the engines by hand to clear the cylinders. \n\nKeeping your ear cocked in the direction of the receding Japanese aircraft you held up your hand to Nobby to get him to wait. For what seemed like an enternity you waited to see if the enemy was going to come back. The engine sounds grew softer at first and then remained steady, moving to the east. You all waited, holding your collective breath. Then they started to grow louder again.\n\n"He saw something," commented Randy, breaking the tension. \nYou immediately ran for your Beau, calling to Davo as you went, noting that he already had the hatch to the cockpit swung open and was busy accessing the primer pumps for start-up. Nobby was already climbing aboard as you reached the revetment and you smiled to yourself. He was not about to be left behind again.\n\nRandy pulled up behind you as you climbed aboard. \n"We won't fire on this pass in case he still isn't sure of what he sees", he called up to you. You nod as you strap and plug yourself into your aircraft. "If he comes back for a third try, every gun in this place will open up. I figure by that point we're not giving anything away. Good luck" \n\nRandy slammed the hatch closed & then thumped the side of the fuselage, giving you the thumbs up through the perspex window. You watched as he ran off to help Bashful prep the gun crews, and then turned your attention to the task at hand..........\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nYou are starting in the revetment by the hut in the south eastern corner of the base. This means you will need to taxi to the runway.  The Japanese recce aircraft is approaching from the east. Once you spot it keep an eye on it during your take-off as you will need to get to it and shoot it down asap. If you lose it, the jig will definitely be up. Watch for Chook and Bazza returning from patrol. They may be able to help you head this guy off.\n\nDO NOT LET THE RECON AIRCRAFT ESCAPE.\n\nPark back in your revetment when you return to base for extra points\n\nTime - 1802hrs\nWeather - Bloody marvellous\n
