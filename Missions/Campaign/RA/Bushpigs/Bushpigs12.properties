Short CAP\n
Description CAP\n\nThe mood around the camp was apprehensive once you and the other two Beaufighters had landed. It seemed, once again in your career, the jig was up. As night closed in, you ordered a doubling of the guard around the base. Micari posted some of his men on an outer perimeter\n\nAs the jungle came alive with the noises of the night, you discussed the situation with Randy, Chook and Micari in your tent. Although you had enjoyed this command for almost 2 months, you always knew that this was a temporary assignment and there was no way that you could hold the base if the enemy decided to move in.  Given that there was little doubt now that your base was known to the enemy, it seemed prudent to withdraw before they could mount an attack. The problem was that you could neither evacuate the base by road nor by air. There were no roads that lead anywhere nor did you have any transport aircraft at your disposal. Help was needed from Port Moresby\n\nAs you finished your dinner of fruitbat casserole and started on your first scotch, it was decided to radio Port Moresby the following morning...\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe workday began before the sun had risen. Randy organised Micari and his men to do patrols wide of the camp looking for enemy activity although there seemed little they could do to stem a large scale assault. At least there was an early warning system in place. He then went about organising your anti-aircraft defence with the impressive collection of captured Japanese artillery. As you watched your men set up on the ground, you got down to setting up your defence from the air.\n\nBecause Randy's wireless set lacked the range to reach over the mountains to Pt Moresby, the usual procedure to radio HQ was to send a kite aloft and some hours west to send and recieve communique.  \n\nBashful volunteered for this job, and although he still looked a little weak from his bout with malaria, he insisted he could fly a course and hold altitude while his R/AG did his duty. You relunctantly agreed as you needed all 4 of your aircraft in the air this day. \n\nHe set off at first light  and you had decided to launch the remainder of your aircraft and have them fly CAP over your base at various altitudes.  Three ground-attack aircraft against who-knew-how-many Jap machines that may or may not appear at any given moment. It was a stressful morning. The coffee wasn't helping........... \n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nWith Bazza gone some 25 minutes, you and your remaining 2 Beaus are ready to take to the air. Chook will be the 1st to take off and he will patrol around the base in a counter-clockwise pattern at about 5500ft. Bazza will take off next and will patrol a clockwise pattern around 7000ft. You will take off last and as commander, you can choose your own pattern and altitude. \n\nRemember to return to base when you are down to your reserve fuel, are out of ammo or are damaged. \n\nStay sharp. Watch each other's backs as well as for attacks on our base.\n\n\nPark back in your revetment when you return to base for extra points\n\nTime - 0724hrs\nWeather - Bloody marvellous\n
