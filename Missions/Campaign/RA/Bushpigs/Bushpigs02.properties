Short Traffic Report - Scouting the Japanese supply line\n
Description Traffic Report\n\nAfter switching off, you disconnected from your Beau and climbed out, a grimace stealing over your features.  After hours in the cockpit you were stiff & sore all over. The silence that rushed in to fill the void left by the thundering engines was almost as oppressive as the humidity.\n\nThe strip was alive with people unloading the transports - RAAF men supplemented by a large number of semi-naked natives. As your ears regained their equilibrium, the sound of the activity around you was somewhat of a comfort.  You noticed a rather dishevelled bloke, clad in ruined khakis and a crushed naval officers cap, making his way towards you. Tanned almost as dark as the natives, he flashed a broad grin of white teeth from under his battered cap and called you by name as he drew closer. After a moments confusion you recognised him as the liaison officer you were told about ..... and as your friend Randy.\n\nThere was backslapping and friendly ribbing as Randy showed you around the base. He was quite proud of his achievements with the New Guineans, having carved the strip out of solid jungle in only a few weeks. With no bulldozers or other heavy equipment, the whole job had been done by hand with axes, machettes and raw muscle power. In answer to your query as to how he had been able to get the runways and taxiways so smooth, he explained how he had over 100 men from the local village marching barefoot up and down the runway for hours on end. It proved very effective. After catching up in your new quarters over a couple of belts of scotch, Randy went to take care of the unloading and left you to settle in...\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nBy noon the following day, the transports are ready to depart and you are following them into the air to conduct a quick scout of the road that runs along the coast to the south of you base. Over a rather dull lunch of cold bully and some dry Weet-bix washed down with tea,  Randy describes it as a regular highway with the Japanese running men and equipment along it with impunity.\n\nHead south from the airfield and take a run along the road. You are solo on this mission.  Take out any targets of opportunity you come across and RTB once your guns run dry.\n\nGuns only.\n\nTime - 12:17hrs\nWeather - Hot. Damn hot. Hot and Humid.\n
