Name Bushpigs 07 Destroyer Hunt
Short Destroyer Hunt\n
Description Destroyer Hunt\n\nYour men were waiting for you upon your return. In the pouring rain, Nobby managed to relay his disappointment at not being included in the mission by scowling at you for extended periods. The other aircrew were also disappointed at being left out of the action but when you told Davo to arm two Beaus with torpedoes, their demeanour improved. Your ground chief, in stark contrast, was not impressed & went away muttering to himself.\n\nThe plan was to go back and try to score some hits on the Japanese warship that was lurking in the area. Randy thought it was a destroyer but was unable to ID it positively due to the lack of visibility. As the weather had not cleared, you decided to only risk 2 aircraft and crew for the mission. When everyone volunteered for the mission, you were forced to chose Chook again as he was the most experienced pilot. Nobby was determined to come along and Randy graciously gave him back his seat.\n\nAfter a short period both Beaufighters were fuelled and ready to go, torpedoes slung underneath.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nChook will take off first and head south to the coast. He will maintain an altitude of at least 2600 ft to make sure he clears the mountains. Once over water he will lose altitude & turn eastwards. Follow him and keep your eyes peeled for the destroyer. (Once again he will appear as "Blue Flight" on your comms & will answer as "Despot 1". Don't forget to order him to attack ships and RTB - He may tell you he is unable to attack the ship although you believe he should be able to - if he refuses, assume he has good reason like a mechanical problem). Stay together until you are back at base. If you lose him, try to find him again. STAY TOGETHER.\nGood Luck.\n\nPark in your revetment in the SE corner of the base for extra points\n\nTime - 0814hrs\nWeather - Still damn awful. Yet again, no-one should be flying.\n
