Short River Rats\n
Description River Rats\n\nIn order to keep the Krait as secret as she had been, questions asked about your early morning flight were explained away as a recce patrol. Nobby looked at you suspiciously from across his mess tin but said nothing. You helped yourself to some tea and set about the day................. \n\nA supply drop was due before noon & as your wingman Bashful was feverish with a dose of malaria,  you decided to send up the second flight of Chook and his wingman, Bazza to meet the C-47s & escort them in. They had been in the air for an hour and you were getting your hands dirty with Davo when Randy approached with a map.\n\n"The Japs are getting nosey" he stated, unfolding the map and spreading it on the mud-guard of the Daihatsu truck your crew chief used to haul tools & parts around.\n"How so?" You stepped in closer to look at the map, wiping your hands on an oily rag. \n"I got a report from Micari that they have landed some troops just up the river from here. I don't know if they're looking for us or whether they are just scoping out the area in general but either way...," he tapped their location on the map for emphasis,"... they're too damn close."\n\nGiving it brief thought, you sent Davo to prep your Beaufighter and, going over details with Randy as you walked, headed off to find Nobby.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe report from Micari puts the Japs only a dozen miles from your base. It appears the enemy has sailed along the river in a few landing craft supported by a couple of patrol boats and has put ashore on the northern bank of the river, east of your jungle strip. Armed with rockets you will take off and follow the river that heads north & then east away from your base. Stay as low as you can along the river. When you spot the enemy force, concentrate on the patrol boats. Once they have been destroyed use your remaining ammo on the landing craft and then the rest of the camp. Randy will be going in tonite on foot with a group of his guys to make sure nothing survives.\n\nRTB when you are done.\n\nRemember we have transports and escorts inbound as well and the enemy must not be able to report the drop should they see it. Let them clear the area before you land as nothing can ruin your day quite like a mid-air collision with a supply crate.\n\nYOU NEED TO TAXI TO THE RUNWAY - CAREFUL\n\nPark in your revetment in the SE corner of the base for extra points when you return.\n\nTime - 1422hrs\nWeather - Nice except for the heat & humidity..and the damn mosquitoes.......and flies\n
