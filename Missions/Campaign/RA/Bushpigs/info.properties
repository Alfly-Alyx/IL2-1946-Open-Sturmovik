Name * Bushpigs
Description A Single Player Fictional Campaign for the Beaufighter. \n Please turn your markings off \n Settings can be anything you want but it is recommended that you turn "No Instant Success" to off(light off)& as there are no waypoints for the main part, you will need to use your map but you should turn your map icons off (No map Icons-Light on). \n The briefs are not really that long but some of the narratives that accompany them are...bear with them because they do add to the immersion. \n Although your rank is only Squadron Leader and your effective duties are those of a Wing Commander, please choose the highest rank available for play.\n\n Good Luck
