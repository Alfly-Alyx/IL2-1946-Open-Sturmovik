Name Bushpigs 06 Storm Surge
Short Storm Surge\n
Description Storm Surge\n\nThe following afternoon, a savage tropical storm hit the area and although a lavish meal was being planned for dinner that evening, it was cancelled & most of the men ate cold bully from the remaining rations while trying to lash down their leaky tents. Towards midnight, the winds died down & the storm settled into a heavy continuous downpour.  Whilst most of your squad slept fitfully, you found yourself in Randy's hut, listening to his gramophone and nursing your Owen & a scotch, while water dripped through holes in the thatch roof.  \n\nTo pass the time you were playing cards when shortly after 0300 hrs, Micari accompanied by two native men entered the hut, dripping wet. Conversing rapidly with Randy in Pidgin, they seemed fired up about something. You waited until they had left before asking.\n\n"They were out watching the coast", Randy explained," and a Jap freighter went aground during the storm. It seems that the Japs have already started to unload her." He shot you a grin. "Would make a nice target if we could find some fool to fly in this weather." Pursing your lips, you raised an eyebrow in interest........\n\nYour ground chief Sergeant Davidson (or "Davo") looked at you as if you were barmey when you got him up at 0400hrs to fuel and arm your Beaufighter. With a disapproving look at the sheeting rain, he roused a couple of erks and all 3 went about prepping your kite. By 0600hrs there was enough light to take off (although visibility was almost nil) and your Beaufighter had full tanks and two 500lbers under the wings. Randy was flying as your observer,  just like the old days.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nTake off and head south. Once you hit the coast, turn left and follow it eastwards. According to the natives, the freighter is stuck fast somewhere near the mouth of a river in grid BD-5. Bomb the ship and shoot up whatever they have managed to unload onto the beach. 2 or 3 passes only. Visibility is bloody shocking so be careful attacking ground targets. RTB by as direct a route as possible. Good Luck.\n\nPark in your revetment in the SE corner of the base for extra points\n\nTime - 0606hrs\nWeather - Damn awful. No-one should be flying.\n
