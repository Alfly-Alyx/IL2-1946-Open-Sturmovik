Description Scarper\n\nFighting off fatigue, you banked your Beaufighter and came back around on your charges. Through the weathered perspex you caught a glimpse of the escort fighters far overhead and, looking back over your starboard wing, you could see Chook & Bazza holding station behind you.  The C-47s lumbered onwards some 500 ft below in loose formation, slow & helpless....\n\nThe American Colonel in charge of the transports had protested loudly when you tried to load the villagers aboard his aircraft. His orders were quite specific - He was to airlift RAAF personnel and equipment back to Port Moresby not, he pointed out, civilians. As you told him that the native women and children were in fact RAAF personnel, he looked at you in disbelief.\n"What about the men then?" he asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm.\n"Royal Australian Navy personnel", Randy piped up without hesitation. The Colonel frowned at him and shook his head.\n"You Aussies are unbelievable", he responded after a bit. \nThe villagers had been assembled, as you had ordered, by the radio shack and at that moment, they were saying their goodbyes to their sons, brothers, fathers & husbands.  Some of the farewells were quite emotional. After watching them for a little, the Colonel turned back to you and Randy. "Okay then. Have it your way." He shrugged resignedly. "It's your show."\n"Thanks mate." was your reply. \n\nAfter that, the loading of the transports went fairly smoothly. As the last of the passengers climbed aboard, you found yourself helping Micari and his men load your abandoned supplies & equipment onto some of the captured Japanese trucks the base had been using. Fuel, ammo, guns & rations. Anything they couldn't use or carry was to be denied to the enemy and so Randy and your aircrews were busy stacking the excess into piles and soaking them in fuel. Empty petrol drums littered the base. Satisfied with the progress Randy approached you, wiping his hands on his filthy uniform. He smiled broadly as the first C-47 fired it's engines.\n"You signed for all this you realise?" He motioned to the nearest pile - crates of spares and rations.\n"It'll take me 'til the late 70s to pay it off, I'm sure."\n"Longer", he grinned."Don't forget your going to be busted down to Aircraftman for this. On those wages it'll take you 'til the 90s at least." You laughed out loud.\n"Too right mate."\n\nMicari had finished loading what they could and his men were busy climbing onto the overloaded trucks. He came over to you and Randy while the lead Douglas taxiied to the runway.\n"Ready to move out", he reported.\n"Good man", Randy replied. He yelled in Pidgin to the drivers and one by one the trucks started. As they moved off, the men in the back called to you and, cheering loudly they raised their new weapons above their heads in salute. Touched by this, you saluted back smartly and held it until the last truck had ground it's way into the undergrowth. Then you noticed Micari standing nearby saluting you in the more traditional way. Smiling, you snapped a salute back and then extended your hand.\n"Thank you Micari." His face was solemn as he shook your hand." And good luck." On impulse, you unslung your ever-present Owen gun and handed it to him. "Use it wisely."\nMicari broke into a grin. After unslinging the Nambu SMG he had been using, he hurled the Japanese weapon onto the nearest pile of discarded equipment.\n"Thank you sir", he replied and slung his new Owen over his shoulder. \n\nYou turned back to Randy.\n"You're staying I take it?" He nodded.\n"Yeah. My assignment is still here." He pointed absently to the jungle and watched as Chook and Bazza started their Beaufighters. The Spitfires were already aloft to cover the take-off, their pilots impatient to be heading west & the 3rd C-47 had just begun it's take-off run. "You'd better get moving", he added, nodding his head at Nobby standing patiently by your crate. Your engines had yet to be started.\n"Yeah...right." With a final wave to Micari, you & Randy strode towards your aircraft. "I hope she starts."\nRandy smiled and called to Nobby\n\n"Get onboard Nobby."  The youngster from Ballarat ducked beneath the fuselage and disappeared into his hatch. A few seconds later his head appeared in the perspex bubble and he called out to Randy through the gap left to accommodate a defensive machine-gun, had there been one equipped.\n"Good luck Lieutenant."\n"You too Nobby. Look after this miserable bastard will you?" He indicated you with his thumb. Nobby grinned.\n"Sure thing." \nRandy ducked under the fuselage and secured Nobby's hatch. On the runway, Bazza prepared to follow Chook into the air, running  up his engines against his brakes. \n"Micari and I will light this place up as soon as you're clear." Randy said as he caught up with you by your hatch. You paused, looking for the right words. Randy shook his head. "Get going. I'll see you when this shitty war is over." Bazza's kite roared down the runway."Go!"\n"Good luck Randy", was all you could come up with."I'll get word to you about the villagers as soon as I can." Randy nodded as you climbed up into the cockpit.\n"Good luck to you my friend", he called through the hatch.Then with a final wave he was gone & the panel slammed close with an enthusiastic thud.\n\nThe big radials, still warm from the morning's action,fired immediately and you were soon airborne, pouring it on to catch the others......\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nA tense but uneventful flight. In spite of the fear of air attack, no hostile aircraft were seen during the trip home. Pt Moresby is in sight. You will be landing at Schwimmer field along with the transports. Cover the C-47s until they are all on the ground. Having come this far, make sure everyone get's down in one piece. Pt Moresby is still prone to the odd air raid, so don't let your guard down yet. Watch the traffic.\n\n(Chook and Bazza are not programmed to land so do not wait for them to do so)\n\n**AIR START** 3000ft/300mph\n\nTime - 1716hrs\nWeather - Still damn hot. Your rash is playing up too.\n
