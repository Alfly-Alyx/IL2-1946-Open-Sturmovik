Short Almost\n
Description Almost\n\nAs you let yourself down through your access hatch and ducked out from under your aircraft, you called to your ground chief.\n\n"We're going again Davo. Same loadout". He nodded and set about the task. You looked around at your base as the men packed it up and decided to track Randy down for an update. Leaving Nobby to help re-arm your kite, you trudged towards Randy's radio hut. Bazza fell in step beside you.\n"We can't stop 'em sir", he noted,"Not with only 2 kites"\n"No," you agreed,"but we can slow 'em down. Hopefully we'll be gone before they get much closer"\nAs if giving credance to your words, Randy stepped out of the shack.\n"Just got word from the transports," he called over to you,"40 minutes out. 'Septics by the sound of 'em. With an escort too...some of our blokes"\nContinuing towards Randy, you turned to Bazza.\n"Go tell Davo the ETA on these guys." Sergeant Barry made off and you turned to Randy, wiping sweat from your face with your dirty shirt sleeve.\n"We'll need to get everything loaded as quickly......." you began but stopped as Randy shook his head.\n"I need another favour" He stepped in close and took your pack of cigs from your pocket. Shaking one out for himself, he lit it while you waited for him to continue.\n"Micari and his men are going to stay on and fight the Japs, but," he nodded in the general direction of the native village," we need to get the women and kids out of here. The Japs will know they've been helping us and will kill every last one of them." He paused and took a long drag on his smoke. "Or worse"\n\nYou considered this as you looked towards the village hidden beyond the surrounding jungle. Stories of Japanese brutality towards non-Japanese had been doing the rounds since the war began. You could only imagine the brutalities that never got told. Rape, torture, cannabalism. Nasty stuff.\n\nRubbing the sweaty stubble on your chin with a filthy hand, you made up your mind and turned back to Randy who was smoking silently beside you, waiting for your reply.\n\n"Alright." You turned from him and called to a group of erks who were assembling equipment to be loaded. "Drop that gear men. The Lieutenant here needs your help to clear the village." You looked back to your naval friend who was beaming at you. "Yeah, yeah. Assemble them near your shack and keep 'em out of the way. Tell 'em to pack what they can but to leave the food. It's going to be crowded"\n"You'll be court-martialled for this, you know?" Randy was grinning from ear to ear.\nYou shrugged as non-chalantly as you could manage.\n"Ah well. Maybe command isn't my thing after all." With a friendly punch on your arm, he moved off with the ground personnel you had volunteered for him. \n\nFeeling good about yourself, you turned back to the task at hand.......\n-------------------------------------------------\nWithin 30 minutes you were ready to take off again. Word had spread around the base of what you were attempting to do, and the men's spirits had lifted. They were all fond of the locals and although it may cost you your commision, job...hell even your freedom, it was the right thing to do. \n Same attack as last time only a little further north along the river (grid B-6) Circle around counter-clockwise and allow Bazza to keep up again. (Don't forget to keep and eye on him and make sure he RTBs with you)\n\nThe transports and their escorts should be close. Watch out for them. \n\n-------------------------------------------------\nPark near  your revetment when you return to base for extra points\n\nTime - 1258hrs\nWeather - Hottest yet\n
