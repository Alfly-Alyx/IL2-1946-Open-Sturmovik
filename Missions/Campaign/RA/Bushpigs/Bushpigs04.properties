Name Bushpigs 04 Watersports
Short Watersports - Seaplane base raid\n
Description Watersports\n\nEveryone had success against their targets that morning and as Randy debriefed the aircrews, you were pleased to note that your squad had now scored 5 air kills under your command. Not too shabby for a ground attack unit.\n\nWith the noonday sun beating down and the humidity a physical weight, you decided that a swim in the river might provide a welcome relief. As you went to wade into the tepid water, a young native fellow started shouting at you from across on the other bank.\n\n"Bikpela pukpuk!! Bikpela pukpuk!!" He was waving his arms frantically and the urgency in his voice gave you pause. You waved back at him and, replacing your boots, made your way back to camp having changed your mind.\n\n"Swimmings not a good idea" Randy stated, noting your towel as he & Micari intercepted you outside your tent. "The water's pretty murky and it's full of leeches." \nYou shuddered at the thought.\n"So that's why that bloke was yelling at me. Leeches." You threw your towel onto your cot from the doorway & stood there sweating in the heavy air. "I guess I should post an order against swimming. One more on the list of "don'ts" for this place." \nRandy shot a look at Micari.\n"Out of curiousity," asked the tall native,"what was he saying?" \n"Sounded like "Bikpela pukpuk". You know what that means?"\n"Oh yeah." He broke into a grin. "That means "Bloody big crocodile".  He started laughing as the colour drained from your face and Randy slapped you on the back.\n"You may want to mention that in your order as well."\n\nFrom that point onwards you carried an Owen gun with you at all times, even in the air. The order banning personnel from swimming went up that arvo.\n\nStudying Randy's well-prepared maps, you chose a seaplane base as your target for the next day. \n\nIntell on the place suggested it was fairly active and was a hub for long range anti-shipping patrols as well as home to a number of float-equipped Zero fighters. AA defences were reported as relatively light. You decide to send the whole flight and briefed them all at 0700hrs the next morning.\n\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe base is located in sector BB-5 on a stretch of land that divided a large bay into 2 smaller ones. All four Beaufighters will rendezvous over the river on the border of BC-BD-8 and head due south to the coast. Once over the coast, follow it west to the target. You are armed with 8 X 60lb rockets each.\n\nNote - You are last to take off. The 2nd flight is already airborne and heading towards the rendezvous point. Your #2 will take off in front of you. Oversee the whole flight from behind for the mission.  Make sure you give commands over the target area and don't forget to get them to RTB.  (The comms show there are 3 seperate flights - You are "Red" - For ease of communication your #2 is "White" and  #3 & #4 are "Blue 1 & 2"  - issue orders to them each as a flight or as a squadron)\n\nPark in your revetment in the SE corner of the base for extra points\n\nTime - 0924hrs\nWeather - Bloody hot and damp!! Kinda hazy as well and damn these mossies!!\n\n
