Name Bushpigs 05 Check Point
Short Check Point\n
Description Check Point\n\nIt was 2 days later that the issue of food came up.\n\n"Hey Skip?" It was "Chook", Flight Lieutenant Greg Hennesey, your 2nd-in-command. "You don't expect we'll be eating these rations the whole time we're here, do ya?" He pointed with his fork at the tin of tuna he had yet to open. "I mean, we're eating like the army." The others grinned.\n\nYou were sitting on a pile of wooden crates marked "Rations - Type A" opening a tin of bully and waving the ever present-mosquitoes away. Most of your aircrews were sitting around on similar crates going through a similar ritual. Your Owen gun lay close at hand. \n\nPrying the lid off your tin of corned beef you looked sheepishly at Chook, and then the others.\n\n"Um....well, yeah."\n\n"I heard you ate pretty well on your last trip skipper." Nobby commented, speaking between mouthfuls as he forced down a tack biscuit. You glanced at Randy who was busy finishing off his own tin of tuna. Tossing the empty onto a growing pile of refuse, he wiped his hands on his shorts & looked around at everybody.   \n\n"I could see if some of the locals would like to cook for you lot ", he said after an extended pause. "I'd need something to trade though." There was silence whilst everyone thought about this.\n\n"What about the rations?" Nobby offered eventually. There were murmors of agreement and Randy nodded.\n"Maybe. I know they like the bully and the tack. The Weet-bix and tuna not so much." He stood up and stretched. "Their cooking may be a little ...um ....exotic for you blokes, but I think I can work something out." With that, he wandered off to strike a deal.\n\nBy that evening he had bargained away most of your A & B rations for the services of 4 native kitchen crew. It was a good deal by any measure, and your squad now had a working mess with an exotic menu. Dinner that night was BBQ Cassowary.\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nDuring the night, Randy recieved a report from Micari about a newly-erected checkpoint along a trail to the west that had recently gone up. The benefits of said checkpoint were unclear but the net result was a bottleneck of Japanese men and supplies at this location.  After discussion, it was decided that you and Chook would hit the amassed enemy late that afternoon. Just before noon, two Dakotas came in with supplies and mail. Always good for morale. \n\nThe transports will take off after you to make friendly territory before nightfall.\n\nThe target is located on a river at either end of the bridge in grid AW-9. Take out the bridge and as many vehicles as you can. \n\nGood Luck.\n\nNote - You weill take off behind Chook. Circle around to the right and follow him to the target and try to keep up.  When you are inbound, stay only high enough to clear the mountains. Issue orders to him in the target area and don't forget to order him to RTB.  Stay together. \n\nPark in your revetment in the SE corner of the base for extra points\n\nTime - 1744hrs\nWeather - Clouds are moving in. Looks like it'll storm tonight.\n\n
