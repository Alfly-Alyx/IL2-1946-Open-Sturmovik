Name Bushpigs 09 The Krait
Short The Krait\n
Description The Krait\n\nThe raid on the bridges was a resounding success and although they would be rebuilt within a week and the defences would be strengthened, very little would be moving across them in the coming days.\n\nThere was a celebratory mood around the base after your return and you stood the crews down for the afternoon. You spent it catching up on your paperwork and signed off on a pile of bumpf that the adjutant had gathered for you. After a dinner of Echidna stew and pineapple sauce, you headed off to your tent, fatigued from the weight of command. It wasn't all beer & skittles as it turned out.\n\nRandy woke you before sunrise.....\n\n"I need a favour", he stated, taking a seat on your footlocker. You propped yourself up on one elbow and blinked at him, a dark shadow on the other side of your mosquito net.\n"Ummff...sure", you mumbled, rubbing your eyes. "What?"\n"There was a guy I met when before I was inducted into Camp Z .  Fella by the name of Bill Reynolds. Good bloke." There was sparks and a flame in the darkness as Randy lit a smoke and continued. "He stole a fishing boat from the Japs and then used it to help people escape when Singapore fell. Both Bill and the boat found their way to Oz and he handed it back to the the Navy. Since then it's been used to transport special-ops guys into enemy territory disguised as a Jap or Malay fishing boat. " \nYou sat up on the edge of your cot, your interest piqued.\n"Ballsy" \n"Yeah. Currently it's under the command of Sub-Ltn Harry Williams.  I met him when he sailed the Krait here to drop me off." He took a long pull on his cigarette, the cherry flaring brightly. "Another good bloke. Anyway, one of my watchers spotted the Krait yesterday arvo east of here and I managed to reach Harry by radio early this morning. It turns out there are two Jap patrol boats that have been following him all night. He reckons they're probably waiting for daylight to challenge him and if you've ever seen the "Krait" you'd know he doesn't stand a chance either fighting 'em or losing 'em."\n"So we're hunting patrol boats then?", you ask, pulling on your boots and climbing into a shirt. Randy stubbed out his cigarette and ran a hand over his stubble.\n"Just showing up may cause 'em to run." he added. "They don't know the Krait's one of ours otherwise they would have sunk her already. They think they're shadowing a local fishing boat so us showing up might be enough to cause 'em to patrol elsewhere." He moved towards the tent flap. Convinced, you followed him outside into the pre-dawn dark. Time to rowse Davo......\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nLast report will put the Krait approx. dead south of our base, heading west at it's top speed of 6.5 knots. Loaded with rockets, you are to take off and patrol grids BC & BD 5. In the gathering dawn the Krait and it's pursuers will probably hard to spot. Buzz the patrol boats and if you can get a shot, take it. RTB once the Krait is clear.\n\nTaxi into your revetment for extra points\n\nTime - 0518hrs\nWeather - Clear & darkish\n
