Description \u0020           \n         ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #5\n\nDate: 13th June 1944\n\nTime: 1815 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nYour attack on the enemy airstrip this morning exceeded all expectations.\nMost of the aircraft caught on the ground were destroyed during the raid, while the majority of the hangars were shattered and set alight.\n\nThe Japs will be hard pressed to make much use of the facility again for quite some time.\n\nWell done!  \n\nThe troop landings on the atolls to the northeast also proceeded exceptionally well.\n\nEil Malik was taken without a shot fired. \nThe only inhabitants being a few dozen native villagers and fisherman. \nFrom what we can gather from the natives; the Japs abandoned their encampment several days ago.\n\nThe landings on Urukthapel further to the north have so far proved more difficult, with a number of enemy bunkers and light armored units defending the enemies retreat along the narrow peninsula.\n\nHowever, we currently maintain a firm grasp of the southern beaches and expect to seize the rest of the attol during the next 24 hours.\n\nThe cruisers HMAS Adelaide and HMNZS Leander lay at anchor offshore providing addition heavy artillery support.\n\nHMAS Hobart and HMNZS Achilles continue to provide similar support for our forces on Eil Malik, but can be moved north at a moments notice should additional fire support be required.  \n\n\nBriefing:\n\nThe USS Amberjack remained on station at periscope depth throughout the day observing enemy movment to and from the devastated enemy airstrip.\n\nNow with dusk almost upon us, her captain has taken advantage of the low visibility conditions to surface his vessel and fall back to safer waters where he can recharge his batteries.\n\nBefore moving off, a short radio message was received advising us of heavy transport aircraft activity going to and from the airstrip.\nPresumably the Japs are packing up all their remaining personnel and equipment and clearing them out.\n\nLead your flight over to the airstrip one more time and finish off any remaining Jap forces.\n\nYour primary targets are any transport aircraft and supply vehicles still on the ground, but keep an eye out for any targets of opportunity in the air.\n\nWith the light failing, we don't expect the Japs to have any fighters lurking about so your flight will be going in alone.\n\nShould you or any of your pilots receive damage, immediately break off the attack and fall back towards our side of the lines.\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Destroy enemy transports.\n\n* Land safely back at the airfield.\n\n\nWeather: Good - Cloud base at 600m\n\nFlight Altitude: 1500m (4900ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 8x 60 lb. Rockets \n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
