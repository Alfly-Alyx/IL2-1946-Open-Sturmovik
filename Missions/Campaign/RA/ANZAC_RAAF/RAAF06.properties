Description \u0020           \n         ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #6\n\nDate: 14th June 1944\n\nTime: 1250 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nNice job finishing off the enemy airstrip last night. It looks like you and your men had a  field day amongst those enemy transports!\n\nWith that airstrip out of commission, the Japs have have only one airbase left  on the northern tip of Babelthuap from which they can launch air strikes against us. Otherwise, any further attacks will have to be staged from the Philippine's... making life just that much more difficult for the bastards.\n\nThe ground offensive through the atolls towards Babelthuap continues to progress well, with the enemy constantly on the back foot. As expected, Urukthapel was cleared of enemy forces shortly before 0800hrs this morning.\n\nThe last remaining obstacle between here and Babelthuap are the tiny islands of Koror, which are little more than coral reefs. \nOnce we've secured this small chain of islands, the main assault on Babelthuap can begin.\n\nYour next mission is aimed at softening up the enemy in preparation for this assault.\n\n\nBriefing:\n\nThe Japs maintain a substantial deep water harbour in Mukeru Bay on the southern coast of Babelthuap.\n\nIntel reports suggest that it is from here that the majority of all their war material is distributed throughout the region.   \n\nYour squadrons mission today is to annihilate the facility,  and destroy anything and everything that you encounter.\n\nThe Kiwi's will launch several minutes ahead of you and take care of the 75mm flak guns guarding the southern approaches, before setting their sights on anything moored alongside the docks.\n\nOnce they've fired their ordinance, they will take up a covering position above your squadron as you begin your attack, then escort you safely back to base.\n\nYour primary targets will be the warehouses and supply depots situated behind the docks. Level the buildings and destroy any vehicles and supplies located in the immediate vicinity.\n\nBe on the lookout for enemy vehicle columns traveling to and from the target as well as enemy aircraft lurking in the skies above. \n \nShould you or any of your flight sustain damage during the attack, immediately fall back towards our side of the lines and try to limp back to base.\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Attack enemy harbour.\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\n\nWeather: Clear - Cloud base at 1500m\n\nFlight Altitude: 1000m (3200ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 2x 500lb Bombs \n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
