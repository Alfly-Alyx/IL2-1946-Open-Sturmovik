Name ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC (AUS)
Description \nIt's May 1944, and the battle to secure New Guinea from Japanese occupation is all but over. \nThe once feared Japanese empire is now buckling under the pressure being applied by the combined armed forces of both the United States and British Commonwealth. \n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur is now planning ahead for the next major offensive... the invasion of the Philippines. \nHowever, one last enemy out-post in the Philippine Sea, based amongst the Kepulauan islands must be dealt with first before any such invasion can begin. \n\nUsed mostly as a staging area for distributing supplies to their forward garrisons throughout the region, this network of islands consisting of at least three airfields and two harbours also serves the enemy as an important naval base, and as such is well defended by a number of land based fighter and bomber units in addition to the warships currently stationed there. \n\nWhile American naval, air and ground forces prepare for the upcoming Philippines campaign, the ANZAC's will be mobilized and sent in in advance to neutralize the threat that this group of islands poses to the main invasion force. \n\n\nPlease select the highest rank available before starting this campaign. \n\n\nEnjoy! \n\n\nAchilles_NZ\n\n
