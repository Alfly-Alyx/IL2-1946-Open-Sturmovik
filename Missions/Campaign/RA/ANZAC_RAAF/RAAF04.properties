Description \u0020           \n         ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #4\n\nDate: 13th June 1944\n\nTime: 0930 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nThe enemy attack on our airbase resulted in moderate damage to the airfield and harbour facilities with a number of transport aircraft and trucks damaged beyond repair.\n \nThankfully, casualties to ground support personnel were light.\n\nOne of the cargo vessles unloading supplies was also hit during the attack and set ablaze, but the damage was confined to the forward hold due to the quick actions of the ships crew.\n\nThe ANZAC Cruiser group arrived back on station during the early hours of this morning.\n \nTheir next task will be to escort the landing craft of our infantry units to capture the small island atolls of Eil Malik and Urukthapel to the northeast. \n\nReconnaissance flights over these atolls during the past 36 hours have determined that the Japanese presence there is now almost non-existent with the bulk of their forces withdrawn to the main island of Babelthuap.\n\nAs such, air support has not been deemed necessary at this early stage.\n\nOf more pressing concern is the apparent ease at which the enemy has been able to launch his aircraft against our forces. Todays mission is aimed at countering this threat.\n  \n\nBriefing:\n\nReconnaissance flights over the main island of Babelthuap to the northeast have pinpointed the positions of several enemy airstrips and at least one deep water harbour.\n\nYou will lead several flights on a strike against the airstrip located on the west coast of the island.\n\nYour primary targets will be the control tower along with its two guarding 75mm flak guns.\nWhite flight will follow up right behind you and target the fighters dispersed on the ground. \n\nThe smaller caliber machinegun emplacements should be considered a low priority.\n \nMake no more than two passes over the target before setting course back to the airfield.\n\n21 SQN will also accompany you on this strike, armed with 1000lb bombs. \nTheir targets will be any remaining bombers and fighters parked in the adjacent revetments.\n\nAfter the Kiwi's release their ground ordinance they will cover your squadron as you make your escape back to the airfield.\n\nDon't get side tracked by engaging targets of opportunity until after you have destroyed your mission objectives!\n\nThe USS Amberjack will be patrolling Grid Ref AZ-27 should you or any of your pilots be forced to ditch or bail out while over the target.\n  \n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Bomb enemy airfield.\n(Target contol tower, aircraft & flak)\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\n\nWeather: Good - Cloud base at 600m\n\nFlight Altitude: 2500m (8200ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 2x 500lb bombs\n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
