Description \u0020           \n       ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #13\n\nDate: 21st June 1944\n\nTime: 0615 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nThe advance continues steadily, with the enemy in full retreat. \nNow forced back into the narrow peninsula at the top of Babelthuap, there are few places left for them to hide. \n\nEven with our capture of Babelthuap imminent, few enemy personnel have surrendered to our forces, preferring instead to take their own lives.\n\nThere has been some sporadic aerial activity to and from the enemy airstrip to the north with a number of transport aircraft observed flying in and out of the shattered base.\n\nSensing that all is now lost, the enemy is obviously trying to withdraw his more senior and experienced personnel to safer territory.\n\nThe ANZAC cruisers have been patrolling the northern coast around the clock in an attempt to prevent enemy transports from gaining access to the beaches and rescuing personnel.\n\nLikewise, 21 SQN has been patrolling the sky's above. \n\n\nBriefing:\n\nWhile patrolling the shallow waters off the northwestern coast of Babelthuap during the early hours of this morning, HMNZS Leander was struck by a single enemy torpedo leaving her dead in the water.\n\nThough the damage to her forward compartments is extensive, damage control teams acted quickly to stem the flooding and prevent her from sinking.\n\nThe most likely suspect is a submarine trying to infiltrate the coastline, but perhaps the chance of taking out a cruiser was just too tempting for the enemy to ignore.\n\nWhatever the reason, they've now sealed their fate with the open water to the west now blocked by HMAS Hobart and Adelaide, while HMNZS Achilles stands guard near the crippled Leander.\n\nThe water along this stretch of coast is extremely shallow, meaning our cruisers risk running aground should they go on the offensive and without radar are unable to penetrate the thick mist currently blanketing the area.\n\nHowever, this also means that the sub will be unable to submerge to avoid detection.\n\nArmed with rockets, you and your wingman are being scrambled to seek out the culprit from above and put it out of action... permanently!\n\nHead towards BB-29 and from an altitude of less than 500 meters, begin your search from the north and work your way south.\n\nDon't return until you've located and sunk the bastards!\n\nEscort will be provided by a pair of corsairs from 21 SQN.\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Locate and sink enemy sub.\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\n\nWeather: Hazy - Cloud base at 500m\n\nFlight Altitude: 500m (1600ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 8x 60 lb. Rockets\n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
