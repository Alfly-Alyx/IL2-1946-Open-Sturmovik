Description \u0020           \n       ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #12\n\nDate: 20th June 1944\n\nTime: 1430 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nThe USS Amberjack has reported a thick haze of black smoke on the horizon in the direction of the enemy airfield.\n\nHQ is still evaluating reconnaissance pictures taken shortly after the strike, but early damage assessments suggest the attack was another outstanding success, with the facility and aircraft stationed there all but destroyed.\n\nThis was just the kind of knock-out blow we have been pushing for. \nWithout nearby close air support, the enemy ground forces don't stand a chance as the sky's above now belong to us. \n\nAny attempts by air at supporting their cause must now be mounted from the Philippines.\n\n\nBriefing:\n\nSeveral hours after the strike on the Jap airstrip our troops on the ground noted a marked change to the morale of the enemy forces and in the way they fight, with a surge of suicidal charges into the face of our heavy caliber machine guns across the entire front.\n\nIn other areas, the enemy has been observed falling back towards the narrow peninsula to the north like rats deserting a sinking ship.\n \nYour mission this evening will be to strike at the enemy along his line of retreat targeting anything and everything that moves on the ground starting in the northwest corner of Grid-Ref BB-28 and moving north.\n\nYour primary targets will be any troop transports and supply columns that you come across.\n\nWith the enemy airstrip further north still in a shambles, the Japs aren't expected to have any strike aircraft in the air so soon, so 21 SQN will not accompany you on this sortie due to urgent maintenance work that needs to be carried out.\n\nFeel free to roam to the northern tip of the peninsula in your hunt for ground targets, but be advised that a number of 88mm flack guns are still operating in the vicinity.\n\nThis will be another lengthy flight so check your fuel gauges constantly, and be prepared to disengage should you receive any leaks due to combat damage. \n\nAs before, the airstrip on the west coast in Grid-Ref BA-28 should be used ONLY in the event of engine problems or fuel emergencies.\n\nHint: Use F7 key to locate enemy ground targets. \n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Attack enemy vehicle columns.\n\n* Secondary - Scout further north if fuel and ammunition reserves allow.\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\n\nWeather: Good - Cloud base at 900m\n\nFlight Altitude: 1500m (4900ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 8x 60 lb. Rockets\n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
