Description \u0020           \n         ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #7\n\nDate: 15th June 1944\n\nTime: 1340 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nThe islands of Koror were swept clear of enemy forces yesterday evening allowing our troops to begin landings upon Babelthuap under the cover of darkness.\n\nThe selected landing beach was approx. half a mile northwest of Mukeru Bay and the harbour that was targeted yesterday. \nWith the enemy units in the immediate vicinity still in a state of panic and confusion, it was deemed as good a place as any to stage the main assault.\n\nUnfortunately, the weather has since closed in with thick ground fog and torrential rain, reducing visibility to less than three miles.\n\nWhile the weather conditions are not expected to hinder the ground offensive too much, air operations in support of the landings have had to be delayed until conditions ease.  \n\nUp until now our forces have had a fairly easy time with the enemy not having the stomach to take us on in a straight up fight; choosing instead to continually fall back.\n\nHowever, with the bulk of their units now withdrawn to Babelthuap, the Japs have nowhere else to fall back to and are finally expected to dig in and take us on in force.\n\nYour squadrons ability to complete your assigned objectives over the coming days will be vital if we wish to conclude this operation successfully.  \n\n\nBriefing:\n\nWith the ANZAC Cruiser squadron providing off-shore fire support, our infantry units were put ashore under cover of darkness during the early hours of the morning.\n\nEnemy resistance to the southwest was much lighter than expected, and the beachhead was quickly secured. \nHowever, further around to the northwest, the enemy was much better prepared.\n\nThe advance was brought to a halt by a large enemy bunker complex, backed up with artillery support.\n\nForward infantry scouts have also observed enemy armored units moving towards our position from the foothills above.\n\nAlthough conditions are still far from ideal, the weather has finally eased enough to resume flight operations.\n\nYour primary objective for this sortie will be to locate these armored units and take them out before they overrun our position. \nOnce you've expended all your rockets, focus your attention upon the enemy bunkers.\n\nA single flight of Corsairs from 21 SQN will be your only airborne backup, but given the current weather conditions, enemy fighters are not expected to take to the air.\n\nAs usual, keep your eyes open for any targets of opportunity, and bring your aircraft back... preferably in one piece.\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Destroy enemy tanks.\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\n\nWeather: Rain - Cloud base at 1400m\n\nFlight Altitude: 1000m (3200ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180moh)\n\nArmament: 8x 60 lb. Rockets \n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
