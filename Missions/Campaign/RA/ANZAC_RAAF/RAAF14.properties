Description \u0020           \n       ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #14\n\nDate: 22nd June 1944\n\nTime: 1215 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nAfter the sinking of the enemy submarine, all naval efforts went to securing HMNZS Leander and towing her to the port of Mukeru where more extensive repairs and patching of the hull can begin.  \n\nSadly, due to the extent of the damage, she will need to be withdrawn to Auckland for a major refit, so it will be some time before she returns to active duty.\n\nThe remainder of the ANZAC cruiser group has since moved further north out into deeper waters, where they continue to patrol for enemy surface vessels.\n\nMeanwhile, on the ground HQ has decided upon making a final push towards seizing the entire northern peninsula to bring this operation to an end.\n\nBy committing all available armored and infantry assets to the assault, it is hoped that our numbers will simply overwhelm the remaining enemy defenders.\n\nReconnaissance pictures taken over the northern tip of Babelthuap show that the Japs have retreated to the high ground to the west of the now abandoned airstrip and have dug in.\n\nUnfortunately, this position affords them an unobstructed view south down the narrow peninsula, which is the only practical route for our forces to take during the advance.\n\nKnowing this, the sly bastards have positioned a number of artillery pieces along the top of the southern ridge, which would annihilate anything we move up before we could get to within range of firing back.\n\nYour mission today will focus on eliminating this threat before that can happen.\n\n\nBriefing:\n\nYou will lead your flight north and make a level bombing run on the hill-top to neutralize the enemies long range field guns.\n\nAs our ground forces are already advancing towards the peninsula, you will need to hit the target on time. (no later than 12:37hrs)\n\nOf course the site will be well defended against air attack, so 21 SQN will accompany you and eliminate any heavy caliber flak and machinegun positions. \n\nAfter dealing with the artillery, make no more than two strafing runs over the site before setting course back to base.\n\nAs usual, 21 SQN will provide escort once you've completed the attack, and the airstrip at Grid-Ref BA-28 will be able to handle any damage or fuel emergencies.\n \n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Destroy enemy artillery.\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\n\nWeather: Hazy - Cloud base at 1000m\n\nFlight Altitude: 1000m (3200ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 2x 250 lb. Bombs\n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
