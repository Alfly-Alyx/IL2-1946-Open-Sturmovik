Description \u0020           \n       ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #15\n\nDate: 23rd June 1944\n\nTime: 1740 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nAfter your devastating attack on the enemy artillery yesterday afternoon, the ANZAC troops surged up the narrow peninsula and quickly surrounded the enemy position.\n\nCompletely surrounded and with little chance of escape, many of the defending garrison put down their arms and surrendered to our forces.\n\nOthers, perhaps fearful of their own officers or shame from being taken prisoner took their own lives.\n\nAfter a three hour standoff the hill-top was finally overrun in a final ground assault, spearheaded by our armored units. \n\nBy 1650 hrs, all enemy opposition had been eliminated and the island was officially secured.\n\n30 Squadrons performance throughout this operation, and especially during the final battles to seize Babelthuap from the enemy has been outstanding. \n\nCongratulations and well done to you and your fellow pilots!  \n\n\nBriefing:\n\nWith the enemy presence in the immediate vicinity now eliminated, the campaign has been successfully concluded.\n\n30 SQN will be taking it easy for the next few days... at least until HQ has made up their minds about what to do with you next.\n\nUntil then its been decided to split the squadron up so that the islands may be better defended in the unlikely event the enemy launches an attack with their long range bombers.\n\nYour mission today is straight forward.\n \nLead red flight north and proceed up the west coast of Babelthuap and land at the forward airstrip at Grid-Ref BA-28.\n\nThe Japs aren't likely to be down this way in force again so soon, but keep your eyes open just in case.\n\n21 SQN will accompany you on this short sortie and cover you while you and your men land, before continuing north on a routine patrol.\n\n\nObjectives:\n\nPrimary - Redeploy to forward airstrip.\n\nNote: Take care when taxiing clear of the runway not to turn off at a right-angle, or proceed too far from the matting so as to avoid crashing. \n\nFor more info please refer to the included readme file.\n\n\nWeather: Poor - Cloud base at 700m\n\nFlight Altitude: 1000m (3200ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: Default\n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nI hope you enjoyed the campaign...\n\nAchilles_NZ\n
