Description \u0020           \n       ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #11\n\nDate: 20th June 1944\n\nTime: 0745 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nSuperb job finishing off the enemy Carrier and its destroyer escorts yesterday.\n\nIt was a difficult assignment, short on planning performed under less than ideal conditions. \nHQ wishes to congratulate you and your men, and pass on another  "Job Well Done!"\n\nHowever, now that you've had a little time to get in some rest, its back to business. \n\nThanks to a low level supply drop that was carried out yesterday morning by transports from 40 SQN, the troops on the ground were once again able to continue the offensive.\n\nAfter inspecting the damage to the runway in Grid-Ref  BA-28, our engineers determined that it wouldn't take much effort to return it to an operational standard with the use of "marsden matting" to repair the crater damage.\n\nAs such, you and your men now have the option of setting down there, but ONLY in the event of fuel or damage emergencies.\n\nThe Japs are slowly but surely being pushed backwards, and it would appear that the operation will be successfully concluded within the next few days so long as events continue to go our way.\n\nTodays mission is aimed at ensuring our guys on the ground continue to maintain the upper hand.\n\n\nBriefing:\n\nThe sole remaining Jap airfield on the northern tip of Babelthuap is to be hit today, and hit hard!\n\n30 SQN will join a combined strike package of Corsairs and Beaufighters in a mission devised to bomb the bastards back to the stone-age.\n\n21 SQN RNZAF will lead the attack and napalm the the aircraft protected by the revetments to the north and south of the control tower, before switching to the role of escort and guarding against enemy fighters.\n\nArmed with rockets, you will lead your squadron in low over the airfield targeting the enemy support buildings and aircraft dispersed about the facility. \n\nThe control tower along with its covering 88mm flak guns should be disabled as quickly as possible before focusing on any of the parked aircraft. \n\nThe USS Amberjack will be cruising offshore to the north in Grid-Ref BC-31 on life guard duty should you or any of your pilots be forced to bail out or ditch.\n\nAlternatively, the airstrip on the west coast in Grid-Ref BA-28 should be able to handle any damage or fuel emergencies.\n\nThis will be a long flight so check your fuel gauges constantly, and be prepared to disengage should you receive any leaks due to combat damage. \n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Attack enemy airfield.\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\n\nWeather: Clear - Cloud base at 900m\n\nFlight Altitude: 2500m (8200ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 8x 60 lb. Rockets\n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
