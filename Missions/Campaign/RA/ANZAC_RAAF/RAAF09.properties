Description \u0020           \n         ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #9\n\nDate: 18th June 1944\n\nTime: 0630 hrs\n\nLocation: 12km's NNE of Mukeru Bay\n\n\nOverview:\n\nTorrential rain and thick fog has kept both sides aircraft grounded for the last 48 hours straight. Fortunately, conditions have since cleared enough this morning to allow us to resume operations.\n\nDespite this, the bitter fighting on the ground has continued with the southern half of Babelthuap now occupied by ANZAC ground forces.\n\nThe resupply of the troops in the field has been made much easier with the capture of the enemy port in Mukeru Bay. \nNow our merchant vessels can unload their cargo straight onto waiting truck convoys on the docks where it is then transported directly up to the front lines.\n\nThe enemy continues to put up stiff resistance from well prepared defensive positions, and in many cases has continued to fight to the last man.\nAs such, few officers of notable rank have been captured alive for interrogation.\n\nThe primary goal for today is to sweep west towards Grid-Ref AZ-27, and secure the abandoned airstrip on the west coast of the island. Air operations today will be aimed at supporting this objective.\n\n\nBriefing:\n\nWhile heading north behind the lines for an air strike on an enemy ground position, your squadron has encountered a sizable force of enemy G4M "Betty" bombers, with fighter escort!\n\nAll previous orders are rescinded.\nAttack the enemy formation and drop as many of the bastards as you can before returning to base to rearm and refuel.\n\nUsing hit and run tactics, attack at high speed from above and behind, but don't loiter for too long within the gunsights of the enemy defensive gunners. \n\nIf the opportunity presents itself, use your air-to-ground rockets at close range only. (under 150 meters)\n\nBe weary of being lured too far north and into range of enemy flak positions. \n\nYour escort from 21 SQN will concentrate on the enemy fighters, but even so, keep a close eye on your tail, and that of your fellow wingman.\n\n\nNote: Mission starts in the air!\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Attack enemy bombers!\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\n\nWeather: Good - Cloud base at 1300m\n\nFlight Altitude: 3000m (9800ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 8x 60 lb. Rockets \n                        80% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
