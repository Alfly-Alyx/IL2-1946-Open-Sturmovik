Description \u0020           \n         ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #2\n\nDate: 11th June 1944\n\nTime: 1730 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nAs expected, the squadrons transfer to the airfield this morning proceeded smoothly and we got our first confirmed kills of the deployment.\n\nWell done!\n\nThe carriers are well on their way back towards friendly waters where they will resume their duties with the US Navy, and begin preparations for the main assault on the Philippines.\n\nThe ANZAC cruisers are currently sweeping the waters ahead of the carrier group, but should rejoin us here in the next day or so.\n\nFor the next 24 hours we are on our own!  \n \n\nBriefing:\n\nIt looks as though word of our arrival has filtered through to the enemy forces based further north on the main island of Babelthuap.\n\nA PBY reconnaissance aircraft spotted several enemy Destroyers steaming in excess of 30 knots on a southerly course towards our position.\n\nOur only means of defending ourselves against this new threat will be to take them out well before they come within range of the airfield.\n\nYour mission this evening will be to swiftly locate these vessels and carry out a torpedo attack, sending them both to the bottom before they cause us any real problems.\n\nYou will lead your flight in an attack apon the lead Destroyer, while "White" flight will target the second following up close behind.\n\nSeveral flights of Kiwi Corsairs will accompany you out to the initial point (in Grid-Ref AX-25), and keep the enemy fighters off your backs while you carry out your attack.\n\nRemember, you will only have one chance to score a hit, but thats all it will take to knock one out. Get in low... real low, and aim ahead of the bow of your target as required.\n\nAs soon as you drop your torpedo, get the hell out of there and return to base. \nDon't make the mistake of circling around for a second approach or the enemy gunners will cut you to pieces.\n\nBe on the lookout for the USS Amberjack (currently surfaced) making its way north for an intercept as additional backup. \n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Locate and sink the enemy DD's. \n\n* Return safely to the airfield.\n\n\nWeather: Good - Cloud base at 1100m\n\nFlight Altitude: 1000m (3200ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 1x Mk 13 Torpedo\n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
