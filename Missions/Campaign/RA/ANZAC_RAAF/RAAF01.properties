Description \u0020        \n       ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\n*Please select "vp_RAAF_A.bmp" as your aircraft skin from the arming screen.\n\n\nMission #1\n\nDate: 11th June 1944\n\nTime: 0730 hrs\n\nLocation: USS Enterprise, 180nm west-southwest of Peleliu Island.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nAfter their arrival shortly before first light yesterday morning, RNZAF corsairs of 21 SQN immediately went about softening up the islands main defenses prior to the ANZAC troops going ashore.  \n\nDespite some initial stiff resistance by the enemy defenders, the ANZAC's eventually  accomplished all of their primary objectives with minimal casualties. \n\nBoth the harbour and airfield were seized relatively intact by 2130hrs late last night. \n\nUnable to hold back our assault; the surviving enemy defenders retreated to the northern tip of the island under the cover of darkness, where a small flotilla of junk's evacuated them further north to safety during the early hours of this morning.\n\nUnfortunately, an air strike was ruled out due to a lack of visibility and it was deemed too risky to send any of the naval escorts into the shallow waters to take up the pursuit.\n\nDespite a few small pockets of resistance among the scattered islands further north, Peleliu is now firmly in our hands. \n\nEngineers were able to extinguished most of the fires overnight, then immediately went to work bulldozing the debris clear of the runways.\n\nWith the airbase now able to receive aircraft, 30 SQN will finally take to the air and take up residency so as not to let the bloody Kiwi's have all the fun by themselves.\n\n\nBriefing:\n\nAfter launching from the USS Enterprise, follow your waypoints to the northern tip of Grid-Ref AX-23 where you will begin your search for the enemy flotilla.\n\nOnce located, use your rockets to sink the junk's and your cannons to deal with any smaller landing craft. \nOnce the enemy flotilla has been destroyed, make your way to the airfield and land.\n\nKeep your eyes open for any other ground targets of opportunity scattered about the smaller islands to the north, but don't wander too far off from your marked route.\n\n"White" flight will lift off from the Enterprise fifteen minutes behind you and proceed directly to the airfield for landing.\n\nFighter escort will be provided by RNZAF Corsairs of 21 SQN. Even so, watch your tail at all times in case enemy fighters manage to slip by them.  \n\nReplacement aircraft will be flown in from New Guinea over the coming days, but until then take care of what we have. Loose these and the entire operation will be over before its even begun.\n\n\nCarrier Take-Off Notes: \n\n*Lower your flaps to the "Take-Off" position.\n\n*Lock tail wheel (unlock prior to landing)\n\n*Apply generous amount of nose-up trim.\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Destroy enemy flotilla.\n\n* Transfer from the USS Enterprise to the newly acquired airfield.\n\n\nWeather: Hazy - Cloud base at 1100m\n\nFlight Altitude: 1000m (3200ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 8x 60 lb. Rockets\n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
