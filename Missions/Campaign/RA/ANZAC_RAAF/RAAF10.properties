Description \u0020           \n        ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #10\n\nDate: 19th June 1944\n\nTime: 0430 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nExcellent result from your last sortie!\n\nThe Betty's you intercepted were forced to ditch their payloads short of their intended targets to detonate harmlessly amidst the thick jungle vegetation. \n\nHad they gotten through, casualties to our forces could have put our entire offensive in jeopardy.\n\nWell done gentlemen, well done!\n\nThe situation on the ground is more chaotic. \nOur guys have made little progress towards clearing the enemy from the hills surrounding the abandoned airstrip with the Japs resorting to hit and run ambushes. \n\nAfter engageing briefly, they then flee into the relative safety of the dense jungle where our armored vehicles can't readily follow them. \n\nPursuits on foot have led to some particularly vicious close quarters fire fights and rising casualties.\n\nNo doubt we will be asked to provide some assistance once our guys pin-point them, but until then we will have to find other ways to amuse ourselves.\n\n\nBriefing:\n\nWhile returning from a reconnaissance patrol off the west coast of Babelthuap, one of our PBY's was jumped by a flight of enemy "Zero's".\n\nThe crew managed to evade their pursuers by diving into a cloud layer below them, then radioing 21 SQN for assistance.\n\nThese aircraft were too far out to sea to be land based, so it became evident that the Japs had deployed one of their few remaining carriers into the area.\n\nAfter dealing with the pursuing enemy fighters, the Kiwi's eventually located the carrier and its escort, consisting of a battleship, a heavy cruiser and five destroyers.\n\nTheir coordinates were quickly relayed to the commander of the USS Amberjack, who was then able to position himself for a submerged torpedo attack.\n\nThe Amberjack fired a full spread of six torpedoes... three of which hit their mark on the carrier stopping it dead in its tracks, while two more struck the enemy battleship.\n \nUnfortunately, the Amberjack was then set upon by the escorting destroyers and forced to withdraw, leaving the cruiser and now damaged battleship to escape back out to sea.\n\nBriefing:\n\nThe Jap carrier remains afloat, but is dead in the water and burning fiercely.\nHQ wants us to finish the bastard off in case the Japs attempt to salvage her.\n\nAccording to the Amberjack's last radio transmission, you should be able to locate it north of Grid-Ref AV-26.\n\nYour mission this morning is to locate the crippled warship, and send it to the bottom with your Mk 13 Torpedoes.\n\nWhile you and your wingman take care of the carrier, the remainder of your squadron will split up and concentrate on several destroyers which are still circling nearby, presumably rescuing survivors from the water.\n\nEven though the enemy warship is extensively damaged, you can expect to be on the receiving end of plenty of AA fire as you make your attack.\n\nGet in and out as quickly as you can, before setting a course back to the airbase. \n\n21 SQN will be patrolling the airspace further out to the northwest  to block any attempt by the enemy to bring in fighter support, so you should have a clear run both to and from the target.\n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Finish off the enemy carrier.\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\nWeather: Clear - Cloud base at 800m\n\nFlight Altitude: 500m (1600ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 1x Mk 13 Torpedo\n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
