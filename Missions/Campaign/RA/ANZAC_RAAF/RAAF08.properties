Description \u0020           \n         ANZACS IN THE PACIFIC - RAAF\n\n\nMission #8\n\nDate: 15th June 1944\n\nTime: 1620 hrs\n\nLocation: Peleliu Airfield.\n\n\nOverview:\n\nAfter reviewing your contact reports from the previous mission, Intel believes the fighters you encountered were Ki-84 "Frank's"... probably flown down from bases in the Philippines.\n\nA far more capable fighter than the elderly "Zero's" and "Tony's" you've gone up against to date, use extreme caution should you encounter them again. Further Intel will be provided once more is known.\n\nThe foul weather continues, and is rapidly deteriorating. HQ is desperate to send us out on one last sortie in support of our ground forces before the weather shuts down air operations completely.\n\nDespite several counterattacks by the enemy to try and push us back into the sea, our troops have managed to establish a solid foothold along a 2 mile stretch of the southern coast southeast of  Mukeru Bay.\n\nVicious fighting continues to the north of the harbour and southwest near the village of Goikul.\nIt is around Goikul that the Japs are now putting up the strongest resistance, bolstered by armored vehicles moving down the east coast from the north.\n\nThe cruisers HMAS Hobart and Adelaide are currently sitting off the east coast shelling anything and everything that moves within range of their guns, while HMNZS Leander and Achilles continue to support our forces to the west.\n\n\nBriefing:\n\nFurther inland at the head of the Goikul river on the northern side of the riverbank, the Japs have established a makeshift firebase.\n\nSheltered from our naval gunfire by the mountainous terrain, the bastards have been able to call in accurate artillery barrages with impunity... and once again bring our advance to a halt.\n\nAttempts by the infantry to storm this position have so far proved futile, resulting in heavy casualties.\n\nYour mission this evening will be to bomb the encampment into submission, allowing our troops to continue the offensive.\n\nYou will lead a single flight of four Beaufighters to the target, release your bombs then immediately head back to base. \n\nThe Japs have positioned a number of 88mm Flak guns in the hills and valleys around the target, so it would be unwise to circle overhead longer than is absolutely necessary.\n\nYou will be going in alone. Should you encounter any enemy fighters, break off your attack and return to base immediately. \n\n\nObjectives:\n\n* Primary - Bomb artillery position.\n\n* Return safely to base.\n\n\nWeather: Rain - Cloud base at 1200m\n\nFlight Altitude: 1000m (3200ft)\n\nCruising Speed: 300 kph (180 mph)\n\nArmament: 2x 250 lb. Bombs \n                        100% Fuel\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\n\nCampaign By Achilles_NZ\n
