Short Covering a troop withdrawl in Lybia.\n
Description 29 Aug 1941 0730\n\n     A most unfortunate turn of events has occurred. Mechanized infantry units of Rommel's Afrika Korps have broken through a gap in our main defensive line on the eastern approach to Tobruk. 8th Army will no longer be able to defend the B3 airfield. We are told that we have an hour, maybe two, before the air field is overrun. After all airworthy aircraft and all personell that can be moved are off the field. The 8th will withdrawl from the airfield and consolidate a defense line on an axis running NW to SE across sector C3.\n\nYour mission is to ensure that our evacuation of B3 airfield occurs with a minimum of friendly losses. Once airborne, you will take a heading of 285 and expedite to sector B3. Do whatever you must to see that friendly air and ground casualties are light.\n\nMission Notes: Home airfield is heading 145 from Tobruk,  115 from B3 airfield, 080 from enemy airfield A1. 050 from D1 airfield.\n\nPlayer Skin: LD_H.bmp\nMarkings: Off\n     \n
