Short Protect a passing convoy of ships\n
Description 05 Jan 1945 1100\n\n     This morning, No. 80 Wing will provide overhead cover for a passing convoy. I know it seems as though we have been put on the sidelines, but I assure that your every sacrifice has been noticed and well recieved.        \n\n     You will take off and turn to a heading of 350, while climbing to your patrol altitude of 3000ft.\nYour assingned patrol sector is A5. A flight of Yank P-51's was the previous patrol, so you will probably see them returning on your way in. And a patrol flight of PBY's will also be operating in the area. \n\nMission Notes: Morotai airfield is 180 from patrol area. Intelligence reports indicate that after the pounding that the enemy airfield has taken over the past month, the airfield is unuseable. The possibility of sighting enemy aircraft is extremely remote.   \n\nPlayer Skin:vp_SpitfireMkVIII_Caldwell.BMP\nMarkings:Off\n
