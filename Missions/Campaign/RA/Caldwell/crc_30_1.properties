Name 9 May 1943
Short A patrol of the Australian coastline.\n
Description 9 May 1943 0755\n\n     One of our radar operators is unsure if what he has been seeing on his scope is a threat. He reports that he saw a quick blip in sector BN17. A short time later he reacquired in the western area of BN17 and then, in BM17. He stated that the time and distance between the short periods of contact could be consistant with a small group of aircraft at a low altitude. Take off and fly immediately to sector BI16. Patrol the area around BI16, and BJ16 for 30 minutes at 3000ft. The radar operator has advised that, once you arrive in sector BI16, look low and to the east.\n\nDepart on the runway heading while climbing to 2500ft. Turn to heading 360 and continue climbing to your patrol altitude of 3000ft. If you encounter no hostile aircraft in your patrol zone, you are clear to return to base.\n\nMission Notes: A flight of two RAF Catalinas are making their way up the coast at this time, and will likely pass through your patrol zone.  Darwin airfield is heading 143 from BG 16 airfield. \n\nPlayer Skin: vp_SpitfireMkVIII_Caldwell.bmp\nMarkings: off\n\n\n
