Name 12 Dec 1941
Short Attack ground targets in the Gazala area.\n
Description 12 Dec 1941 0800\n\n     The 8th was able to break through to Tobruk on the night of the 7th. It seems as though the Germans have beenstretched too thin. On the 29th of Novemeber, they were on the verge of taking Tobruk. But as of today, the Afrika Corps with almost nonexistant Italian support has fallen back to a line east of Gazala. Most of their consolidation appears to be south east of Gazala. \n     This afternoon, 250 Squadron will attack ground targets ahead of a push by the 2nd armored brigade towards the airfield in sector B3. Regaining posession of this airfield will no doubt solidify our position. \n     Also say a prayer for the Yanks. An outpost they have on some island was attacked by the Japs on the 7th. Word is, they may have lost as many as a thousand men.\n\nTake off and climb out to the left of the airfield at 2500ft. When the boys in the second flight are in the air, take up a heading of 295 and proceed to the target area at 8000ft. Like other previous missions, identify before you fire.\n\nMission Notes: Home airfield is heading 145 from Tobruk,  115 from B3 airfield, 080 from enemy airfield A1. 050 from D1 airfield.\n\nPlayer skin: LD_H.bmp\nMarkings: off\n\n     \n
