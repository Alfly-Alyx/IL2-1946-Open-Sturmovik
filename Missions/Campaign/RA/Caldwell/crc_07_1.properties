Name 16 Aug 1941
Short An convoy escort in Lybia.\n
Description 16 Aug 1941 0930\n\n     A resupply convoy is headed to Tobruk. You will escort the convoy through sector D3. The men at Tobruk desperately need these supplies and ammunition. This is a high-priority assignment. I know that 250 Squadron is the right one for the job.\n\nTake off and turn left on climbout. When you reach the coast, turn to 285 at 1500m and fly to Sector D3. There you should be able to visually acquire the convoy as they make their way to Tobruk. We expect the 109's will be on the ground refueling after their early morning patrol, so you should not run into any fighters. After the convoy elements reach the Tobruk perimeter, turn heading 145 for recovery.\n\nMission Notes: Home airfield is heading 145 from Tobruk,  115 from B3 airfield, 080 from enemy airfield A1.\n\nPlayer Skin: LD_H.bmp\nMarkings: Off\n\n     \n
