Name 14 Mar 1942
Short A combat air patrol over Tobruk.\n
Description 14 Mar 1942 1000\n\n     The attacks on Tobruk have continued over the past few days, and we expect that there will be more today. Be ready to pounce on the Stukas as they make their approach. Make every effort you can to get them before they release their bombs. When you encounter Me-110's watch for their rear gunners. We have lost more aircraft than we would've expected to the backseaters.\n\nClimbout on the runway heading to 2000ft. Turn to heading 285 and continue climbing to your assigned patrol altitude of 11000ft. When you reach the middle of sector C2, take course 360 and begin your patrol. Set your cruise speed in the patrol area for maximum endurance.\n\nMission Notes: Home field (E2) is heading 115 from Airfield B3. 145 from Tobruk. 040 from D1 airfield. 080 from enemy airfield A1.\n\nPlayer skin: P-40E Buglords 112Sqn Egypt 1942.bmp\nMarkings: off\n\n     \n
