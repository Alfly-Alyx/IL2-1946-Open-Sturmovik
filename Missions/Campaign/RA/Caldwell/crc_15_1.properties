Name 18 Dec 1941
Short Fighter sweep of the Gazala area.\n
Description 18 Dec 1941 0500\n\n     I am glad to see everybody back from this mornings patrol. As soon as the ground crews have refueled and rearmed your aircraft, you will go back out. It seems as though the Germans have been able to field a newer 109 than the ones we are used to. Some of the guys say it's an F type. Like the ones seen over the Channel starting  a couple of months ago. Look for rounded wingtips to identify the F type.\n\nTake off and climb to 3000ft. Turn to heading 180 while continuing to climb to your patrol altitude of 11000ft. When you reach the oasis in sector E1 you will turn to heading 270. Maintain this couse until you reach the eastern edge of sector B1. Turn to heading 360 and conduct a recon patrol of the front from sector B1to B4. If you have encountered no opposition at this time, you will turn 090 and fly to Tobruk. Turn 155 and return to base.\n\nMission Notes: Home airfield is 115 from B3 airfield, 085 from enemy airfield A1. \n\nPlayer skin: LD_H.bmp\nMarkings: off\n\n     \n
