Name 28 Sep 1941
Short Covering an air drop resupply of Tobruk.\n
Description 28 Sep 1941 0500\n\n     A resupply by air has been scheduled this morning for Tobruk. Even though it is not enough, it is something that will help our boys last one more day. Once the drop is made, close air support is the order of the day. A flight of Hurri's will already be conducting a strike by the time your escort is finished. you will join them in striking targets of opportunity. Focus on the 88's and the Panzers as these are obviously the most dangerous pieces of German equipment.\n\nWhen you are airborne, orbit in sector D2 to meet with the Gooney Birds as they pass through. By flying early we are hoping to avoid the daily early morning patrol flown by local 109's. You will proceed with the C-47's on a heading of 340 and orbit over Tobruk as they make thier drops. When the C-47's have cleared enemy airspace, you are cleared to engage hostile ground targets as they appear.\n\nMission Notes: Home airfield is heading 145 from Tobruk,  115 from B3 airfield, 080 from enemy airfield A1. 050 from D1 airfield.\n\nPlayer Skin: LD_H.bmp\nMarkings: Off\n\n     \n
