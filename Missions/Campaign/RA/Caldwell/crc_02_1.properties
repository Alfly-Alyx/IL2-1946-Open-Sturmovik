Name 26 Jun 1941
Short A bomber escort over Lybia.\n
Description 26 June 1941 0830\n\n     Today we will attack Axis positions at Gazala (sector A3). Your flight will escort a group of bombers that will strike a supply depot in that area. Our intelligence indicates a buildup of Panzers at the Depot. We have decided it will be easier to destroy the tanks there, than to have the Army do it in the open desert.\n\nAfter takeoff, you will proceed on a heading of  320 to the southeast corner of sector C4. Meet the bomber group there at 12000ft and escort them to the strike area (A3). Destroy any enemy aircraft that threaten the bombers, and make sure they are protected until they reach their airfield(D1).\n\nMission Notes:\nHome field (E2) is heading 100 from Gazala, 085 from enemy airfield(A2 South), 050 from D1 bomber field, 145 from Tobruk.\n\nPlayer Skin: LD_H.bmp\nMarkings: Off\n\n     \n
