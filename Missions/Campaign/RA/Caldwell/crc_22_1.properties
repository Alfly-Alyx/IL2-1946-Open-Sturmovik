Description 11 Mar 1942 1000\n\n     Though the Afrika Korps is in a consolidation mode south of Benghazi, the Luftwaffe is still posing a considerable threat to operations in and around Tobruk. The garrison was attacked twice yesterday and once this morning by a mixed group of dive bombers and attack aircraft. We suspect that they will return.

When you reach the center of sector C2, take a heading of 360 and begin your patrol. Maintain your presence over the Tobruk area until fuel becomes a concern, until otherwise instructed, or as combat conditions dictate.\n\nMission Notes: Home field (E2) is heading 115 from Airfield B3. 145 from Tobruk. 040 from D1 airfield. 080 from enemy airfield A1.\n\nPlayer skin: P-40E Buglords 112Sqn Egypt 1942.bmp\nMarkings: off\n\n     \n
