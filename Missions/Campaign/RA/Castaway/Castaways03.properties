Name Castaways 03
Short \n
Description The A-20 was a total loss but the US crew survived with minor injuries. You and Randy show them around the abandoned base and over a delicious meal of fish and fruit, powdered eggs and tinned meat, you talk to the pilot, a young lieutenant named Eddie Farmer, and try to figure out where you are.\n\nIt turns out that his A-20 was shot up on a anti-shipping patrol and also became lost. With one engine dying and precious little fuel, he spotted the island and headed in. He also has no idea where you are.\n\nWith the war still raging around you, (you seem to be behind enemy lines),  you decide that as a combined force of castaways, you should continue your war effort. You discover that amongst the wrecks on the base there is a Wildcat that is relatively undamaged and a B-25 that might be made flyable, (with some work). In order to leave the impression that the base is not being used, all the debris and wreckage is left where it lies.\n\nRandy and the other US crew members surprise everyone by working on the Wildcat all day and getting it running by late arvo. Aside from a couple of bullet holes the biggest problem was neglect.  With the tubby fighter fully fueled and armed, you and Eddie draw straws to see who will take it up for the test run. You win/lose. \n\nTake the Wildcat out for a test run. Head to the small island south west of the airfield, turn around and come back. If you encounter the enemy ensure they don't see you return to the base.  Don't forget to park back in the hangar. We can't afford for the enemy to spot "life" at this field.\n\nWeather - Gorgeous\nTime - 1616hrs\n\n
