Description For the next few days, everyone worked on getting the one remaining, relatively-intact B-25 airworthy. If there was to be an evacuation of the base, neither the Beau nor the Wildcat could carry everyone. (Where you would go remained an open question) The Mitchell could carry everyone and was defendable, if need be. \n\nThe combined skills of everyone paid off on the 3rd day after many patches and repairs. The airframe, controls, etc were in good working order as was engine #1, but the starboard engine was a stubborn old cow. After much adjustment, tinkering, swearing, praying and luck, the big Wright R-2600 finally caught and, after clearing it's throat, set up a steady idle. From the cockpit, Eddie ran it up and after seeing that everything looked good he leaned out the mixture until it stopped. The big prop shuddered to a halt and the silence that descended over the base was enormous.  \n\nAfter some discussion it seemed prudent to move the B-25 away from the airfield so as not to lose this escape vehicle, should the base be attacked.  The more it was discussed the more important it seemed and although it was getting late, a spot was selected to the north of the strip. The quickest way to move the bomber was to fly it there. Towing it just seemed too problematic and would take the better part of a day.\n\nTake off in the B-25 for a very short hop to the north of your little island. (The B-25 needs a longer take-off run than the Beau so it is suggested you turn left and taxi to the end of the runway and use it all to take off - watch the wreckage)\n\nEddie and his crew are already at your destination and have lit some fires to help guide you in. Approach from the northern end of the island. Time is of the essence as we don't want to have the fires lit for too long. Land and park in the area between the 2 trucks at the far end of the "strip". (In the revetment that our forward-thinking Randy prepared earlier) Be careful as the ground is rough. \n\nHurry back because Randy is making scallops in a munthari butter sauce for dinner.\n\nWeather - Nice...but getting dark\nTime - 1812hrs\n
