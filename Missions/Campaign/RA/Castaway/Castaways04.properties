Description As you switch off, Randy and your new friends give you a round of applause for the enemy you dispatched. Smiling broadly, you make your way over to the Beaufighter, expressing concern about the hostile fishing boat that was firing upon you. Randy points out that whilst he has figured out how to load bombs onto the Beau, and that they are available, he hasn't done so yet. But he has re-armed the guns and topped off the fuel.\n\nMarvelling at Randy's skills, you climb aboard and turn over the big radials and he climbs into the observer position.\n"I haven't fixed the intercom yet", he states, "but let me work on it"\n\nSink the fishing boat - guns only. (Use your ammo wisely) Should be close to where you saw her last. The crew probably saw us operate from this base so they need to be eliminated before they bring the whole Japanese army down on our heads.\n\nRandy suggests to make multiple high-speed passes only opening fire at the last minute. He's a pretty cluey fellow.\n\nReturn intact to the hangar.\n\nWeather - Still nice. Looks like a pearler tomorrow too\nTime - 1707hrs\n\n
