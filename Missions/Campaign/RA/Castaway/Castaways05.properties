Description You wake up the following day feeling good. You are doing your bit for the war and living in paradise. No parades, no saluting....and you're eating like a king. (Randy cooked some sort of apricot chicken dish the night before.  You thought to ask him where he got the chickens and the apricots, but decided to leave it alone)\n\nEddie took the Wildcat up for the morning patrol, and after your mid-morning swim, you notice that the men have set up a couple of salvaged AA guns at the south end of the field. In order to keep up the appearance of a deserted airfield, the makeshift crews are not to fire unless the enemy is within 50 metres. \n\nYou meander back to the hangar and Randy beckons you over to the desk where he has set up a radio-set to monitor the airwaves. Eddie has just radioed in that he has spotted some enemy transports, with an escort, about 20km west-south-west of the base. They seem to be heading for their airbase in sector F6. Consulting the map that Randy had drawn up from your earlier flight around the islands, you figure the transports are currently in sector B2. Eddie states that he hasn't been seen and will shadow the enemy until you arrive to take on the transports. You copy him and, grinning widely, you climb aboard the Beau.......\n\nThe enemy formation is in the SW corner of sector B2, as you start your engines. They are at 3300 ft, heading 045 degrees at about 190mph. As you do not want to get too close to the enemy base (Sector F6), you must disengage and RTB once you cross into sector E5. \n\nReturn to your hangar intact.\n\nWeather - Okay. Some clouds 1400m\nTime - 1143Hrs\n
