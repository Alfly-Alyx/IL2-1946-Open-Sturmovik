Name * Cast Away
Description A Single Player Campaign for the Beaufighter, and others. Rank should be lowest. Switch map icons off and make sure "No Instant Success" is enabled (Light is on). Leave your minimap path on. If you can't read all your necessary instruments then leave your speedbar on.\nRemember the key is to fly smart. \n\nIgnore the explosions at the start of most missions....it's just the set dressers doing their work. If you want an airfield without residual smoke etc, scroll through some camera shots after the explosions and return to your cockpit. If you receive medals or awards during this campaign, Randy is keeping track and manufacturing them out of old beer cans and bits of canvas.\n
