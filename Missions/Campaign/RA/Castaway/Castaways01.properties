Name Castaways 01
Short Cast Away\n\nA Single Player Campaign for the Beaufighter, and others. Please select the highest rank, switch map icons off and make sure "No Instant Success" is enabled (Light is on).\n\nIgnore the explosions at the start of most missions....it's just the set dressers doing their work. If you want an airfield without residual smoke etc, scroll through some camera shots after the explosions and return to your cockpit.\n
Description Seperated from your flight and lost in a storm, you have been blown out to sea and have no idea where you are. Your observer, Randy,  (a former jackaroo from the Darling Downs),has been strangely mute for the whole mission, your compass is spinning wildly, the radio is giving you nothing but static and your fuel guages are showing "0".To top it off, it is now getting dark. \n\nA great start with your new squad.  You need somewhere to land pretty quickly here or you'll have more to worry about than the guys laughing at you. \n\nWhat's that? A chunk of dark in the storm that looks more solid than the rest.  Land?  Another reef? You decide to head towards it in the hope that you may be able to put down on it. And if not, you're no worse off. Survival in the raging sea will be fairly short-lived anyway.\n\nThe big Hercules radials begin to sputter and die and you realise that you just ran out of options.....\n\nFind the airfield and land intact. (maintain your 85-90 degree heading)\n\nCAUTION - AIR START Note that under these conditions, with your wheels and flaps deployed, the Beaufighter needs at least 100mph (160kph) to stay in the air.\n\nWeather - Deadly\nTime - 1814hrs\n\n
