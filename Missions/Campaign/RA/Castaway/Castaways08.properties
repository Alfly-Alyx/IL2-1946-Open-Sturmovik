Description Scotch flowed freely that night in celebration of your success against the Vals. Dinner consisted of yabby ravioli with a wild lime and cheese sauce followed by a pavlova. Bloody good stuff!!\n\nThe next morning, as you swam off your hangover, Randy was monitoring radio traffic and polishing up on his Japanese. As you lay on the beach, drying in the noon-day sun, he came down with Eddie in tow.\n\n"Wanna try a torpedo run?" he asked with a wry smile.\nShading your eyes with your hands, you squint at him standing above you.\n"What have you got?"  is your grinning reply.\n\nBack in the hangar, Randy produces another of his excellent maps and points to a sector off to the east of the island. According to the traffic, a Japanese submarine is dead in the water after a fire in the engine room during the night. A flying boat was dispatched to the sub to drop off parts and a repair crew to get the engine servicable enough to get the sub back to port under her own steam. \n\nRight now though it makes a tempting target.\n\nYou all get to work to arm the Beaufighter with a torpedo.\n\nAccording to Randy, the stricken sub is sitting in sector I-3 in the NW corner.(Heading roughly 075-080 degrees) Eddie will cover you in the Wildcat. Get out there and sink her. Don't get too close because her gunners will probably be on alert. Try to stick together.\n\nReturn to your hangar intact. Watch for pursuit.\n\nWeather - Kinda crappy. No rain but cloudy.\nTime - 1343hrs\n
