Description Weather cancelled air activities for the next few days on both sides. You spend your time playing cards in the relative dry of the hangar with your American friends and Randy scans the radio traffic, looking for any sign of an allied signal.\n\nLate one evening Randy called you over to his radio and said he heard what he believed to be American voices. He couldn't understand what was being said but he was sure that they were not Japanese and although he had lost the signal shortly thereafter, it gave everyone a glimmer of hope. Friendly folk were still out there and perhaps getting closer. This couldn't last forever.\n\nThe next morning the weather had cleared somewhat and over a breakfast of ham and cheese croissants, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit and coffee, you all hear approaching aero engines. One of Eddie's men spots a couple of Emily flying boats skirting the island and heading south, low to the water and laden with bombs.\n\nAs Wednesdays are your days to be "on call", you climb aboard the Beau and while everyone watches the Emilies pass from under cover, you wait for the signal from Eddie that it is safe to take off........\n\nTake out the flying boats if you can.\n\nReturn to your hangar intact. \n\nWeather - Kinda murky\nTime - 1343hrs\n
