Short \n
Description A quick look around your immediate vicinity reveals that it has been evacuated under some duress. Why the enemy has not moved into the position you cannot figure, but for now it remains abandoned and has been for some time. Not as bad a situation as it could be but far from ideal. As the sky gets darker and the rain gets heavier, you and Randy prepare to spend an uncomfortable night under your Beau's wing in the middle of the cratered runway. \n\nYou awaken to the smell of frying meat and coffee. Randy has scrounged early that morning and found some stores that were left behind.  The rain is gone and the airfield looks worse in the stark light of day.\n\nRandy fills you in on the condition of the base but tells there is still useable food, ordnance and fuel around the field.  After breakfast, you both explore the burnt-out buildings and vehicles looking for maps, charts, a long range radio or anything that would give you an idea as to where you are, but you have no luck. \n\nYou do find a hangar that was missed in whatever Japanese raid destroyed this base and using a jeep,  you tow the Beaufighter under cover.  Using a tanker, you and Randy refuel your aircraft.  You try your radio again but you get either static or Japanese across the dial. \n\nBy early arvo, you decide to risk a flight around the island chain you seemed to have landed on, to maybe try the radio at altitude and see what there is to see. Hell, there may be an allied base only a few kilometres away, right?\n\nTake off and fly north and check out the lay of the land.  Don't stay out late.\n\nThis mission is for you to familiarise yourself with the area. The only object is to return to your hangar intact.  Avoid enemy contact. You do not want them to follow you back to base.\n\nOnce again, the object is to return to your hangar intact . You must park inside the hangar to avoid being seen by any Japanese aircraft - This is the mission objective.\n\nWeather - Bewdy\nTime - 1528hrs\n\n
