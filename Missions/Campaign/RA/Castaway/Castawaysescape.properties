Name Castawayescape
Short \n
Description The jig is up. \n\nShortly before breakfast, your motley crew of castaways swung into full alert as a formation of Japanese aircraft was spotted approaching your base.  There was no mistaking their intentions as the lead Zeke headed in at full throttle, the others following suit. \n\nSwinging your contingency plan into action, everyone boarded the big Diamond T and Eddie drove like a maniac to where the escape B-25 was hidden away.............\n\nRandy had been picking up more allied signals all through the night and at best guess he believes friends may be found to the east. (Maybe J2)\n\nTake off and head east. You are on your own and if spotted, pursuit may be hot. (For some reason the intercom aboard the Mitchell doesn't work either) Randy will continue to try the radio and may have luck as you get closer to whatever friendlies lay to the east. Until that point, if indeed that happens, fly like you've stolen it.........\n\nIf you do make radio contact, don't be shy about asking for help.\n\nYour take-off will be rough and your roll will be long. Remember the B-25 can lift off with flaps at about 110 mph (175kph). If you make it to the allies, you can ditch or try landing on a carrier. (none of you remembered your chutes) But it's a big "if". \n\n**REMEMBER**\n\n* This B-25 falls out of the sky, dirty, about 105mph(170kph). \n* The B-25 is wider than most carrier-borne aircraft and you will need to stay further left of the island. \n* The Captain of the carrier will run her up to 65kph (max speed) if you choose to land on her.\n\nIt can be done...but judge wisely. It's a lot of work to get to this point and a swim ain't so bad. Randy suggests a wheels-up attempt on a carrier, Eddie opts for a swim, you're thinking about trying the carrier........your call\n\nWeather - Makes no difference.   What?   Are you not going to fly?\nTime - 0701hrs\n
