Description Two days later, Randy surprised everyone with some lamingtons he had made to celebrate one of the US crew's birthday. Lamingtons and scotch. A party in any language!!\n\nMidway through the festivities, Eddie held up his hand for quiet and in the relative silence that followed, the sound of appoaching aircraft engines was unmistakeable. A lot of aircraft.\n\nOne of the other US crew identified them as a formation of Vals, low and slow, headed straight for the base. Before anyone could react further, the lead plane passed over the base, oblivious to you and your mates below. The whole formation was following suit......\n\nScramble....with prejudice! Wait until the formation has passed over and then take-off and destroy as many enemy as possible before returning to the party. Do not venture out of the hangar until the formation has passed overhead. Eddie will join you in the Wildcat. Remember though that the rear gunners on the Vals can be quite effective concentrated in formations like these. Try to shoot some down sure, but be content to beak up the formations. Randy's good, but he can't manufacture spare parts out of the air (unlike his cuisine) nor can he patch up any injuries you may receive. Don't press your luck.\n\nReturn to your hangar intact.\n\nWeather - Didn't really notice.....kinda drunk\nTime - 1022Hrs\n
