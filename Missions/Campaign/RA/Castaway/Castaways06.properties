Description Dinner that night was Palusami (using snapper) and a whole pig that Randy prepared using a traditional lovo. The taro leaves, coconut and snapper was a combination that was simply exquisite and the pork was delicious. Randy had also discovered a case of scotch.\n\nOver dinner, Randy said that, knowing a little Japanese, he had listened to radio traffic all day and had figured out that the enemy had set up a camp on the shores of the large island to the west of their airbase, right next to a small village called Goikul by the locals. He then went on to suggest that it would be a good target for an early morning hit and run type raid.\n\nDiscussing it then with Eddie, you decide that at first light, both aircraft carrying bombs could hit the camp and return to base without a large risk of pursuit from the nearby enemy airbase, providing the raid was performed quickly.  According to Randy's rough translation it is being supplied by sea by both boats and seaplanes. Either that, or they were talking about dancing horses and a cello.......\n\nAfter a good night's sleep helped by a quantity of scotch, you and Eddie head out.\n\nThe Wildcat is airborne. Take off and follow him into the target area. As far as Randy can make out, the camp is located in grid refence H6 (52.5 - 71.0). Fast and hard. Watch for pursuit. \n\nReturn to your hangar intact.\n\nWeather - Misty. It'll be a ripper later.\nTime - 0607Hrs\n
