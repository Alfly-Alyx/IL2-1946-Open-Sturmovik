Name M14
Short 5 Sqn Hove intercept\nFebruary 1943\n\n
Description February 1943\nTime:  0900,  Weather:  Clear\n\n155 Sqn moved one of its flights to Imphal in early February 1943 with the rest of that squadron moving there in early March.  From Imphal 155 Sqn made raids to Myitkina, Shwebo, and Kalemyo areas, as well as escorting transports and defending Imphal against Japanese bombers and fighters. \n\n5 Sqn Mohawks were again moved to Hove strip in February.  The Japanese were raiding the Arakan, Chittagong, and the forward strips at this time.  As Japanese activity increased in the pre-monsoon period, it became obvious that a single wing of four Hurricane squadrons was not enough to cope with the increasing enemy raids in the Arakan.  It was difficult to maintain continuous readiness with the frequent false alarms and the split-approach  method used by the Japanese.  \n\nThe Mohawks had previously been kept out of much of the Arakan battles because of their similarity to the radial-engined Japanese fighters.  Mohawks were often mistaken as Oscars and fired upon by friendly Hurricanes.  But now more defense was needed and so this is why the Mohawks made the move to the forward strips.\n\nMission:\nJapanese fighters are approaching Hove.  Four Mohawks there must scramble and intercept.  Four others from Ramu will arrive later so hold the enemy til help arrives.\n
