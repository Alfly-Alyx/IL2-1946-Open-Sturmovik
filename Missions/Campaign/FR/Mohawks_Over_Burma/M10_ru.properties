Name M10
Short 5 Sqn Akyab escort\nJanuary 19, 1943\n\n
Description January 19, 1943\nTime:  0900,  Weather:  Clear\n\nSeveral new RAF airfields were built in Arakan.  These included fields at Dohazari, Ramu, and Nidania with codenames Hay, Lyons, George, Hove, and Reindeer.  The beach strip named Hove was quite popular with the airmen because they were able to swim on a section of the world's longest continuous sandy beach.  However, there was still a war to be fought.  British forces were bogged down on the Mayu Peninsula and bombing raids seemed to have little effect on the enemy.\n\nMission:\nSix 5 Sqn Mohawks will takeoff from Hove to escort Blenheims on a bombing attack on Akyab Island.  The bombers will be at 1000m approaching Hove from the north.  The first section of Mohawks will escort at 1200m and the second section will escort at 1500m.\n
