Short Akyab escort\nOctober 7, 1942\n\n
Description October 7, 1942\nTime:  1100,  Weather:  Good\n\nThe previous raid on Akyab satellite airfield seemed to be successful at first but the pilots realized they were shooting at dummy planes--old RAF planes.  Some still had the RAF roundels on them!\n\n5 Sqn's new role was to escort Blenheim bombers to Akyab.  The Japanese were building up their forces for the defense of the Arakan as well as preparing for an upcoming invasion of India.  Akyab harbor was busy with ships unloading supplies and troops and the RAF made many bombing missions against them.\n\nMission:\nEight Mohawks will escort four Blenheims to Akyab harbor.  The first section will provide top cover by flying at 5000 ft (1500m) and the second section will be lower escorting the Blenheims at 600m.  \nThe Blenheims will takeoff from Fazilpur airfield, fly at 500m altitude, bomb Akyab harbor, then land at Agartala.\n
