Name M15
Short 5 Sqn Toungup Road attack\nMarch 23, 1943\n\n
Description March 23, 1943\nTime:  1300,  Weather:  Clear\n\nThe Hurricane squadrons may not have liked having the Mohawks around because it was hard to distinguish them from Japanese fighters but Group HQ found the Mohawks with their superior range so suitable for the work over the Mayu Peninsula that they would have liked to use them exclusively.  60 Sqn's Blenheim crews informed 5 Sqn's Intelligence Officer that they were always glad to have Mohawks in attendance on the Blenheims.\n\nMohawks continued to escort, fend off Japanese attackers, and carry out ground attack missions as well.  The strafing and use of 20 lb. bombs on enemy supply routes was quite effective.\n\nThe RAF first used Vultee Vengeance dive bombers operationally on 19 March 1943 and 5 Sqn had the honor of escorting them on their first mission.  Vengeances and Hurricanes were increasingly used in the ground attack role and were to eventually phase out the twin-engined Blenheims.\n\nMission:\nFrom Maungdaw South airfield, perform a recon of the road north of Taungup.  Strafe any enemy vehicles you might see.\nRoute:  to Kantha at 2000m, then to Taungup at 2000m, then turn north and fly along the road at low level until you get to Kangaw again where you will climb to 2000m and return to base.\n
