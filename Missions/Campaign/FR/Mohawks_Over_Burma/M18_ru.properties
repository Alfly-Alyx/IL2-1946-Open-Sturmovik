Name M18
Short 5 Sqn Maungdaw ground attack\nMay 19, 1943\n\n
Description May 19, 1943\nTime:  1700,  Weather:  Good\n\nThe only "Yank" in 5 Sqn, Lloyd Duncan Thomas, left and joined his compatriots in the US Army Air Force.  Thomas, originally from Texas, was granted a commission as a Pilot Officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force in May 1941 and fought in Burma in '41 til '43.  He was awarded the DFC in May 1944 but was posted MIA in April 1944.\nWing Leader William Pitt-Brown was also awarded the DFC in May 1943.\n\nThe Mohawks were at this time becoming outdated and operationally unfit.  Its operational height was now limited to 15,000 to 18,000ft (4572-5480m) because the oil pressure fell off at these heights.  Nevertheless, the ground crews performed exceptional jobs to keep them flying.  155 Sqn flew Mohawks until January 1944.\n\nDuring May the squadron was kept busy with bombing and strafing Japanese positions over the Maungdaw-Buthidaung sector as well as escorting Blenheims.  Raids were also conducted over the road north of Taungup where several vehicles were destroyed.\n\nAt the end of May, 5 Sqn turned all of its Mohawks over to 155 Sqn and re-equipped with Hurricane IIDs, armed with menacing 40mm cannons, and then later on changed to flying Thunderbolts.\n\nMission:\nFour Mohawks will attack the waterfront and boats at Maungdaw.  Search for and destroy any other enemy targets you might see.  Fly at low level to avoid being sighted by the enemy.\n
