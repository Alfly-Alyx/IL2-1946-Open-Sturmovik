Short Akyab satellite airfield\nSeptember 30, 1942\n
Description September 30, 1942\nTime:  0855,  Weather:  Good\n\nFrom the book "MOHAWKS OVER BURMA":\nIn the late summer of 1942 the sole defence of India against the victorious Japanese advancing through Burma rested on the shoulders of a little band of Commonwealth pilots flying Mowhawk fighters.  For the next eighteen months, these men- Canadians and British, New Zealanders and Australians, and many others- were constantly in action over India and Burma.  Bomber escort, ground attack, reconnaissance, and Chindit support were all in a day's work for the men of the Mohawk squadrons....Flying and fighting over the rivers and mountains of Burma, life on the jungle airstrips and the tmporary bases on the beaches of the Indian Ocean, whirling dogfights with agile Japanese fighters, and the strange roads that brought these men to fight and some die in this almost forgotten campaign.\n\nRAF 5 Squadron with their Mohawks were moved to Agartala and Feni on September 27.  This move into East Bengal was in connection with the forthcoming British air and ground offensive along the Arakan coast toward Akyab Island.\n\nMission:\nEight enemy aircraft are reported on the ground at the Akyab satellite airfield at Narigan.  Twelve Mohawks will bomb and strafe this target (Mohawks also carried up to ten 20 LB bombs-not available in IL2).\nThree sections of four will fly at 1000ft (300m) to the target.  After the attack, fly south over Akyab Main to recon the area, then return to base.\n
