Name Blenheims
Short Practice intercept of RAF Blenheims.\n
Description 303 Squadron\nRAF Northolt\n21st August 1940\n\nWe have once again been given the task of carrying out a practice intercept on a flight of RAF Blenheim bombers, the idea being that we will know the so called fighting area attacks off by heart when the time comes to put them into practice.  You'd think that none of us had ever seen a Dornier.  I know that every one is sick of Blenheim intercepts and keen to get into the real war but for the time being we have to continue with this training programme.  At least they have allowed us to participate in defending our own airfield if it's attacked, so that's a step in the right direction.\n\nAir Chief Marshall Sir Hugh Dowding:\n'I must confess that I had been a little doubtful of the effect which their experience in their own countries and in France might have had upon the Polish and Czech pilots, but my doubts were laid to rest, because all three squadrons swung into the fight with a dash and enthusiasm which is beyond praise.  They wer inspired by a burning hatred for the Germans which made them very deadly opponents. The first Polish squadron (Number 303), in 11 Group, during the course of the month shot down more Germans than any British unit in the same period. Other Poles and Czechs were used in small numbers in British squadrons, and fought very gallantly, but the language was a difficulty, and they were probably most efficiently employed in their own national units.'  \n\n\n
