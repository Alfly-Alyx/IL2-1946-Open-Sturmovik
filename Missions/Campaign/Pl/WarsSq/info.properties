Name: Warsaw Squadron
Description: This campaign follows number 303 Squadron's involvement in the Battle of Britain. 303 Squadron was the 2nd Polish fighter squadron to be formed within the RAF and was equipped initially with Hawker Hurricane Mk1s. The squadron was declared fit for operations on 31st August 1940 and between then and mid October was involved in very heavy fighting in the South East of England from its base at RAF Northolt. By the time 303 Squadron was rested they had become the highest scoring Squadron in the Battle of Britain. This will be a very tough campaign to get through on the hardest settings, but worth trying just to get a feeling of how desperate it must have been. I sincerely Hope that you like it.  EAF602_Whizz
