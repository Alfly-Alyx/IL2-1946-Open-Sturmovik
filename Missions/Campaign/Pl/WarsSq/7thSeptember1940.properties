Description 303 'City of Warsaw' Squadron\nNumber 11 Group\nRAF Northolt\n\n07th September 1940\n\nHere we go again chaps, 90 plus forming at angels 20.  Lets get them.\n\nFollowing the injuries sustained by both Squadron Leader Kellet and Squadron Leader Krasnodebski on the 6th, Witold Urbanowicz is put in temporary command of 303 Squadron.\n\nAt 1700 on the 7th 11 Hurricanes engaged 90+ German raiders.  A Canadian squadron had already claimed the attention of the enemy fighters so 303 were given a shot at the bombers this time.  17 e/a were claimed in this engagement for the loss of 2 Hurricanes.  No 303 Squadron pilots were lost.  Tragically however one of the abandoned Hurricanes crashed in a residential area, killing a family sheltering from the raid.\n\nCombat Report F/Lt Forbes\nB Flight, 303 Squadron: \n'They were easy meat. We came at them from partially up sun and at great speed as they turned away from us. I led in, and attacked a Do215, hitting the starboard wing and engine, which stopped.  I gave another good burst into the cockpit and more stuff fell off. E/A fell away sideways in a long glide and hit the sea. I broke away, and whilst in a steep turn, a shell hit my starboard wing root and exploded. I felt my leg was wounded and there were 3 or 4 glycol and hydraulic system leaks in the cockpit. I decided to return to an Aerodrome and got the machine down whole. \n
