Name October 7th 1940
Short October 7th 1940\n
Description 303 'City of Warsaw' Squadron\nRAF Northolt\nNumber 11 Group\nOctober 7th 1940\n\nBy now the Battle of Britain was drawing to a close.  Luftwaffe raids became a series of hit and run attacks by penny packet fighter bomber formations, or high altitude sweeps by large Me109 formations.  The heavy bombing began to take place at night.\nOn the morning of October 6th 303 lost another of its'  pilots  when a lone Ju88 swooped down out of the clouds to drop a stick of bombs on the airfield.  One Hurricane was destroyed on the ground and Sgt Siudak was killed in the blast.\n\nThe last large scale air battle that number 303 squadron was involved in took place the next day when they met a large formation of Me109s South of London.  Claims were made for 2 Me109s destroyed.\n\nOn October 8th the Squadron flew a Morning patrol during which they lost one of their great aces, Sgt Josef Frantisek.  He was killed when his Hurricane dived straight down into the ground.  A possible explanation is that he might have suffered hypoxia caused by faulty oxygen equipment.\n\nBy the end of World War 2 the RAF had in it's ranks many highly experienced Polish aircrew as well as those of many other nations.  Their contribution to the final defeat of Tyranny by the Nazis is well documented and appreciated.  Despite all their heroic efforts however some of them returned home to face a new tyranny, some even being thrown into communist prisons and accused of treason,  while others made new lifes for themselves in the West.\n\n
Group Captain John Kent: 'I cannot say how proud I am to have been privileged to help form and lead No.303 Squadron and later to lead such a magnificent fighting force as the Polish Wing. There formed within me in those days an admiration, respect and genuine affection for these really remarkable men which I have never lost
We who were privileged to fly and fight with them will never forget and Britain must never forget how much she owes to the loyalty, indomitable spirit adn sacrifice of those Polish fliers. They were our staunchest allies in our darkest days; may they always be remembered as such!'
