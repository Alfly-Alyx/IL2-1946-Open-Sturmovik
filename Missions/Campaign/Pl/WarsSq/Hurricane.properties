Name Hurricane
Short Take a Hurricane up for the first time\n
Description Number 303 City of Warsaw Squadron\nRAF Northolt\n12th August 1940\n\nAfter travelling through Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and France you have finally arrived in Britain to continue the fight against Hitler.  Because of your association with 111 Eskadry and the pursuit brigade you have been posted to 303 squadron, which is the 2nd Polish squadron to form within fighter command.  You have already proved your ability in formation flying, aerobatics, navigation, marksmanship and many of the other skills that are required of a front line fighter pilot in a variety of training aircraft such as the Hawker Demon and the Miles Master.  You are also making good progress with your English.  Today you have your first flight in the Hawker Hurricane monoplane fighter. There have been several wheels up incidents during the past week and one aircraft was written off in a taxiing accident.  Fortunately noone has been hurt yet but some precious Hurricanes have been heavily damaged.  The most important things to remember are that the throttle is in the reverse direction from the aircraft that you're used to flying in Poland and of course the retractable undercarriage.  The flying instruments are in Imperial feet and miles per hour too rather than the continental metric system that you're used to.  She's yours for the next half hour or so, don't get too enthusiastic, just try to get a feel for her.  Good luck and enjoy yourself but please be careful.\n\nJohnny Kent:\n'We were faced with the problem of not only to form and train the squadron in the normal way, we also had to teach rudimenatary English and convert the pilots onto our aircraft which were Hurricanes. This presented more problems than one would normally expect, as some of the pilots had never flown aircraft with retractable undercarriages. Also throttles worked in reverse direction, few had handled constant speed propellors, the airspeed was indicated in MPH instead of Km/h and the altimeter registered feet instead of meters. I was amazed and very favorably impressed at how rapidly the Poles mastered these complexities, both pilots and ground crews.'\n
