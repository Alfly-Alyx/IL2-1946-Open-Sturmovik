Name August 30th 1940
Short Another practice intercept on Blenheims\n
Description 303 Squadron\nRAF Northolt\n30th August 1940\n\nWe have been instructed once again to practice our intercept techniques on the obliging Blenheim crews of RAF bomber command.  I know that you are all sick of training and want to get to grips with the enemy but the more practice we have before then the more effective we will be as a team when the time comes.\n\nDuring this flight Flying Officer Paszkiewicz and his wingman broke formation to attack a German aircraft which he then shot down.  This is the incident which is famously recorded in the film 'The Battle of Britain' in which an irate Squadron Leader Kellet tries unsuccesfully to reign in his Polish charges calling for them to return to formation.  F/O Paszkiewicz was reprimanded for his actions and then congratulated on his success in the same interview.  303 Squadron was declared operational that evening.\n\nCombat Report\nFlying Officer Paszkiewicz:\n'We took off in two flights for exercises in attacking Blenheims, at 4.15 p.m.  After climbing to 10,000 feet we flew northward. After a while we noticed ahead a number of aircraft carrying out various evolutions.  The center of the commotion seemed to be about 1,000 feet below us to starboard. I reported it to the OC, S/Ldr Kellet, by RT and, as he did not seem to reply, I opened up the throttle and went in the direction of the enemy. I saw the rest of the flight some 300 yards behind me; below me were teh burning suburbs of some town and a Hurricane diving with smoke trailing behind it. Then I noticed at my own altitude a bomber with twin rudders, probably a Dornier, turning in my direction....\n
