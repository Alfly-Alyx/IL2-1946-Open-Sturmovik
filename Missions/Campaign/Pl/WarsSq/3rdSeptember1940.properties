Name 3rd September 1940
Short 3rd September 1940\n
Description 303 'City of Warsaw' Squadron\nNumber 11 Group\nRAF Northolt\n\n3rd September 1940\n\nIt's been an eventful day so far.  This Morning we were bounced by Me109s and one Hurricane was forced down,  fortunately Sgt Wojtowicz is safe.  Shortly after that B flight was attacked by Spitfires!  Luckily noone was hurt.  Anyway, they want us to fly an afternoon patrol so maybe we'll get lucky before the day's out.\n\nOn this sortie, Sgt Frantisek claimed a lone Me109 for his 3rd victory.\n
