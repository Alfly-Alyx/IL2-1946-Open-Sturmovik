Description April 11, 1945, 3 p.m.\n\nIt is a less known fact that Germans were using captured Soviet tanks in the Balkans. As the war is nearing its end, Yugoslavian partisans were able to capture many of them. They plan to use them against Germans in order to shorten the war as much as they can.\n\nPartisans forces are gathering tanks for further use near Bulinac. But unfortunately there was a spy among partisans, who ran away and told the Germans about it.\n\nNow the Germans together with their Croatian collaborationists are preparaing an air raid against this position...\n\nThe Partisan air force is too weak to stop them, we must aid our comrades!\n\nXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\n\n11. dubna 1945, 15:00\n\nJe m\u00E1lo zn\u00E1mou skute\u010Dnost\u00ED, \u017Ee N\u011Bmci pou\u017E\u00EDvali uko\u0159ist\u011Bn\u00E9 sov\u011Btsk\u00E9 tanky na Balk\u00E1n\u011B.
