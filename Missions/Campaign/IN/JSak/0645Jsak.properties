Description \nHelping the neighbors\n\nDate: 18th of March, 1945\nTime: 08:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kanoya\n\nDespite our best efforts, a few fighter-bombers got through to Kanoya and attacked parked aircraft and airfield structures. Several bombs and rockets struck the runway. When my wingman Akeshi Ochi was landing, his right gear hit a small crater and his plane ground-looped. He lost consciousness, but thankfully the plane didn't catch fire and Ochi was taken out of the aircraft virtually unhurt. The Raiden was a sturdy plane, and his aircraft could be quickly repaired, back in action the next day.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nWe made our report to Air Group HQ, and the pilots got a little breather while the runway was being repaired.\n\nIntel reports stated that a large group of enemy carriers was situated South-East of Kyushu. They continued to launch air raids against our bases, apparently looking to destroy our divine wind special attack units they knew were located on Kyushu. \n\nFrom the air it seemed that the entire island was on fire. Enemy airplanes struck everywhere, hitting our airfields, and the towns and villages around them. Unfortunately, poorly trained army pilots could do little to stop Americans. Navy aviation bore the brunt of the fighting.  At 07:50 we received orders to scramble and intercept enemy planes projected to strike the Kagoshima airfield. \n\nYour Objective: prevent the enemy from attacking Kagoshima.\n\nYour Flight: 8 z Navy Interceptor Fighter Raiden Model 33.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 08:00 heading South-East. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 3,200 m. The first flight is to attack the bombers; the second flight is to hold off the fighter escorts. \n\n
