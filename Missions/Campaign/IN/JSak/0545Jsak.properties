Description \nMorning raid\n\nDate: 18th of March, 1945\nTime: 06:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Konoya\n\nIt was astonishing that the best the Imperial Navy could gather at Iwo was so easily shrugged off by the enemy. Less than two years before at New Guinea and Guadalcanal we shot down those Americans effortlessly, and now the tables have turned. I vividly remembered missions over Port Moresby, when the enemy stood no chance, and it was not uncommon for our pilots to return with several victories after each mission. Our Type 0 could outmaneuver any enemy plane, and our fighting spirit, our training and discipline made each of our pilots into a perfect weapon. But now, it seemed that our individual skill was not enough. What could a handful of warriors do against a horde of barbarians coming in an endless stream out of a far-away land we could not touch? American industrial might was producing planes unhindered, while our own factories were increasingly coming under attack. \n\nDeep inside, I knew most of us understood that total defeat was now the only possible outcome. However, we were still going to do our best in the face of it. We would fight the enemy every step of the way. \n\nAfter being evacuated from Iwo Jima I was transferred to the 332nd Air Group of the IJN. Along with the venerable Type 0, the 332nd also had a handful of the new Raiden fighters. In late 1944 our Kokutai was reassigned to defend Tokyo and Yokohama from B-29 raids. \n\nIn March of 1945 attacks on our southern-most island, Kyushu, became too heavy for the existing fighters to deal with. Our Kokutai was transferred to the Kanoya airbase on Kyushu, where we would once again be intercepting B-29. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nEarly this morning, at 05:45, our Raidens were scrambled to intercept an approaching group of B-29s. Radar plotted their course directly over air base, so an air strike on Kanoya itself was possible.\n\nYour Objective: intercept enemy bombers.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Raiden Model 33.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:00 heading South-East. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 4,000 m. Army fighters will work alongside you. Your task is to prevent the enemy from bombing your airfield.\n\n
