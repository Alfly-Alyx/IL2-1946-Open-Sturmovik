Description \nDefending Fukuoka\n\nDate: 24th of April, 1945\nTime: 06:50\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Fukuoka\n\nLast news from home was dreadful. My father informed me that my entire neighborhood burned to the ground after a barbaric bombing raid. There was nothing but private homes and shops for miles around us. Why did the Americans bombed us? There was an army training camp just a few kilometers to the South, but it remained untouched...\n\nThankfully, my family had a country home an hour away, and my mother and sisters were sent there a few days prior. My father contemplated joining them, but the loss of our home was just too much. A Navy reservist, he joined the Imperial Volunteer Corps. Among other tasks, the Corps helped with evacuating civilians, chased incendiary bombs during air raids and guarded the city against marauders. These brave men and women had plenty to do nowadays. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nMeanwhile, we continued to defend the great island of Kyushu. Despite desperate efforts by the enemy, our airbases remained battle-ready. One after another, enemy warships around Japan plunged into unfriendly waters, thanks to the incredible sacrifice of the tokkotai pilots. Even a few of my pilots requested to be transferred to a tokkotai regiment, but their request was denied. Japan needed elite interceptor units like ours, and experienced aces were not something we could afford to lose so easily.\n\nOn the 24th, radar stations made a familiar report: enemy bomber formation escorted by multiple fighters approaching Fukuoka. Our regiment was to intercept. Army pilots were scrambled alongside. Our objective was to engage the fighters, and allow the army planes to take care of the bombers.\n\nYour Objective: keep the escorts busy during the attack.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Shiden Kai.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:50 heading South-East. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 4,000 meters.\n\n
