Description \nCoastal Waters\n\nDate: 28th of March, 1945\nTime: 16:20\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kanoya\n\nThis time the Americans were unable to drop their deadly cargo unpunished. A few B-29 and their ten-men crews will never return to Marianas. Our fighters, armed with four aerial cannons, may not have been very maneuverable, but they could do the job against heavy bombers.\n\nUnfortunately we didn't have enough of these planes. Constant air raids, often numbering over a hundred bombers, pedantically targeted one factory after the other. We were short of engines, propellers, aviation fuel. \n\nOur best pilots were lost at Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Midway, Philippines, Iwo Jima, Okinawa. The number of experienced pilots in air groups was waning every day. Just a few elite squadrons, like ours, could occasionally hurt the enemy. The young boys everywhere else stood little chance. Some didn't even die from enemy fire; instead they perished in flying accidents, or were lost while trying to navigate in bad weather or over the ocean.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThe enemy continues to strike at our industrial capacity and our supply lines. Specially equipped B-29s are mining the waters between the home islands, attempting to disrupt our sea transport routes. \n\nOn the 28th of March a gaggle of B-29 was reported to be mining the Shimonoseki Straight, the stretch of water separating Kyushu and Honshu. We couldn't stop them in time, but at least well be able to hit them on the way back. We got orders to scramble and patrol the area of their most likely return route.\n\nYour Objective: lead your flight to intercept the B-29s returning from the Shimonoseki Straight. \n\nYour Flight: 4 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Raiden Model 33.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:20 heading South-East. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 3200 meters. Your flight route will lead you onto the bombers on a head-on course.\n\n
