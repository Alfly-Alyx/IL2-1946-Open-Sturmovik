Description \nDespair\n\nDate: 4th of July, 1944\nTime: 10:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Iwo Jima\n\nOne after another the 0 fighters that survived the uneven battle returned to the gutted airfield. Men on the ground did their best to make our landings possible, and the squadron circled over the tiny island, waiting for the holes to be covered up. One after another planes ran out of fuel, and pilots were forced to land wherever they could, however they could. Some landed alongside the runway with their gear up, some tried their luck with their gear down. Everyone tried to make sure their planes could be flown again. No one worried about their own safety. \n\nI expected no recognition for my action against the dive bombers. Lieutenant Yamaguchi was directing the efforts on the ground, but for a few seconds I'm sure he looked straight at me without the usual disdain in his eyes. I began to feel proud. The shame of defeat was starting to evaporate. \n\nThe score at the end of the day was pitiful. By the evening of the 4th of July, only ten planes were flyable out of the entire squadron. Some pilots were wounded; others were suffering in the tents from drinking local water. The umbrella over Iwo Jima that seemed so strong two weeks ago was now a tattered ruin.  It was clear to everyone that a couple more American air raids would finish the job and annihilate the rest of us, and then the island would be left defenseless. \n\nWe tried to focus on the positive. Despite everything, our will to fight was strong. Each of us hoped to be among the ones sent up in the remaining planes, and we knew we wouldn't sell our lives cheap. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThe scenario was becoming familiar. In the early morning our intercept station heard intensifying radio chatter from afar, and then the radar station saw a large group of planes approaching from the West. All flyable planes were scrambled and ordered to intercept the enemy. \n\nYour Objective: destroy as many enemy planes as possible.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Navy Type 0 Carrier Fighter Model 52b.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:00 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. After take-off proceed South-West, gaining as much altitude as possible before encountering the enemy. In case of battle damage, try to bring the precious aircraft back to the airfield.\n\n
