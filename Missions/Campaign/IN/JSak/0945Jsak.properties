Description \nReconnaissance Intercept\n\nDate: 24th of March, 1945\nTime: 10:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kanoya\n\nAmerican carriers withdrew a hundred miles South towards Okinawa, and carrier-borne fighters stopped bothering us for a while. At least in the scuttle a couple of days ago we really made them feel the pain. While we suffered heavy casualties and lost many planes and pilots, the Americans also lost plenty of aircraft. Amassed attacks by special attack units, targeting enemy ships, did occasionally manage to break through the fighters and flak and hit their targets. Even a large carrier was probably sunk on the 19th of March, last seen laying dead in the water, with a heavy list to the side, and almost completely obscured by billowing smoke. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nDespite the hit-and-run attacks of the carrier planes, the B-29 heavy bombers still remained the biggest threat to the homeland. Their concentrated attacks on our industrial and civilian targets were unmatched in scale, and caused significantly higher damage than any fighter-bomber raid. After the carrier planes withdrew, we once again switched to intercepting the Boeing juggernauts. \n\nOn the morning of the 24th of March, early warning radar located a single slow target approaching Kyushu at extreme high altitude. This was likely a reconnaissance plane, either checking out the weather over the islands, or photographing targets before or after bombing runs. These recon flights usually came in unescorted, hoping we would consider a single plane so high up too unimportant and too difficult to catch. \n\nAt 09:50 we received orders to scramble and intercept the recon plane.\n\nYour Objective: prevent the B-29 from reconnoitering the Kyushu airspace.\n\nYour Flight: 2 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Raiden Model 33.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:00 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 10,000 m. Do not forget to manage your engine during the climb and switch supercharger stages.\n\n
