Description \nFormidable opponent\n\nDate: 16th of April, 1945\nTime: 08:50\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kanoya\n\nOn the 7th of April, our interceptors that went on an intercept mission that had by now become routine, met something completely unexpected. The giant B-29s were not alone. They now had escorts! These were the fast and maneuverable P-51 Mustangs, launching from Iwo Jima.\n\nAmerican fighters were eager to claim their kills. Unfortunately few of our pilots were prepared for this. Their heavily armored and heavily armed planes, intended to attack the lumbering B-29s, were a poor match for the nimble Mustang. Many pilots perished in the hail of gunfire from Mustangs' batteries of machine guns. We lost several dozen planes. This was a disaster.\n\nAttacking heavy bombers was a feat in itself. Now that there were hungry fighters roaming about, this would be even more challenging. All other mission types would become harder as well.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nOur intel estimates the American fighter strength at several large regiments. We expected them to make repeat appearances over Kyushu, an island filled with delicious targets.\n\nWe greatly increased the number and intensity of our patrols. Nine days passed without any significant engagements. On the 16th of April we again received orders to patrol the southern coast of Kyushu.\n\nYour Objective: patrol the designated area.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Raiden Model 33.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 08:50 heading South-East. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 3,200 meters.\n\n
