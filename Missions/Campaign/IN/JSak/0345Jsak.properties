Description \nThe Heavy Blow\n\nDate: 3rd of July, 1944\nTime: 05:40\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Iwo Jima\n\nThe battle on the 24th of June was painful to recall.  I could see that the entire Kokutai felt the same way. It was hard to be optimistic in the face of such resounding failure. Would we be able to do better? What could we do better? I tried to think back logically, to analyze our mistakes, but all I could see was red streams of tracers over my head, and the orange fireballs of our fighters tumbling towards their reflections in the water. \n\nThe three Iwo Jima Kokutais lost forty planes, half of our strength. Many of the returned planes were virtually beyond repair. The few victories we claimed were not even a consolation. They seemed like an insult. How could we have been so outmatched? We wanted to attack, but all we could do was evade a firing pass after firing pass, maneuvering just to save our sorry lives. That was the hardest thing to face.\n\nThe enemy gave us plenty of time to reflect. Their warships fired at our airfields after we landed, and after that we were left alone. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nAfter a week and a half of licking our wounds, by July it became clear that the American Navy was preparing to strike again. On the 3rd, our radar station reported the approach of several large enemy formations. Most of the airworthy fighters were scrambled, but as we had more pilots than planes, I was not included in the group. \n\nI watched the 40-odd Type 0 Fighters take-off, form up over the island, and disappear towards the South-West.\n\nSoon the radar station reported another single-engine formation to the North-East of the island. These planes flew a tighter formation, and were slow: bombers. It looked like our unprotected airbase could be caught completely undefended. I just couldn't bear the thought of letting something like that happen.\n\nWithout thinking, I ran towards an old "hangar queen" Type 0, and ordered the mechanics to start the engine.\n\nYour Objective: intercept enemy planes heading for your airfield.\n\nYour Flight: 1 x Navy Type 0 Carrier Fighter Model 32.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:40 heading South-West. The enemy is approaching from the North-East, out of the rising sun. After take-off evaluate the situation and do your utmost to defend your home base. \n\n
