Description \nB-29\n\nDate: 27th of March, 1945\nTime: 17:40\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kanoya\n\nOn the 25th of March, it seemed every single newspaper published glowing reports about our intercept of that B-29. Me and my wingman could hardly believe the honor. When the journalists and photographers came, it took a lot of willpower to remain composed and factual throughout the interview. I was especially glad that my parents would see my photograph in the paper. I knew they'd show it to everyone, and all our friends would know I was a good warrior, doing my duty defending our land from barbaric attacks.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nOn the 27th of March, early warning radar reported a large enemy formation approaching from the East, from the direction of the Marianas. These were large four-engine bombers, most likely B-29s, and their projected target was Omura.\n\nKokutai HQ ordered all cannon-equipped interceptors to take-off and meet the enemy.\n\nYour Objective: lead your flight to the bombers.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Raiden Model 33.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:40 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 6,000 meters. The flight route should put you straight ahead of the formation, allowing for an initial head-on pass. Try to aim a full salvo at the bomber's glass cockpit. After the attack, do not repeat the mistake of many young pilots and climb straight up. This will make you a perfect target for all defensive guns in the vicinity. Instead, you can dive and then split-S, executing a second firing pass from below; or chandelle to the side, and perform a series of attacks on the bomber's beam from alternating directions.\n\n
