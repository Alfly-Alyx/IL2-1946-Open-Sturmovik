Description \nThe Hunt\n\nDate: 29th of March, 1945\nTime: 07:55\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kanoya\n\nLast night, as I flew over the coast, I suddenly regained some of that long-forgotten feeling of wonder. I flew over the wave tops, along the ruby pathway towards the setting sun. The engine roared, but the airwaves were quiet, and save for an occasional fishing boat I was all alone in the world. At that moment, I was not at war. A moment of unbelievable clarity washed over me, and I was above all the minute things that preoccupied me before. I became an ancient wind spirit, and even though the elation soon faded, the memory of the moment stayed with me for the rest of the day. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThe next day we again started our routine. There were more B-29s heading towards Kyushu. I mentally prepared myself for the usual, but then new orders came in, and I was tasked with something different. Other pilots would attack the main formation. I was sent against single planes patrolling over the ocean and searching for aircrews of ditched B-29s.\n\nYour Objective: locate and intercept aircraft attempting to rescue American airmen.\n\nYour Flight: 1 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Raiden Model 33.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:55 heading South-East.
