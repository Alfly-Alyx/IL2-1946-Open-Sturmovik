Description \nAs the Engines Roared\n\nDate: 25th of May, 1945\nTime: 17:35\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Fukuoka\n\nSummer at Kyushu was breathtaking. Fresh air, bright sunlight, deep blue sky, crystal clear water whispering in the mountain brooks, cranes performing their spring dance in the fields, flowers everywhere. After each mission I'd wander off to where I could no longer hear the engines, and would just lie down and stare into the sky. I could rarely find serenity even there. Contrails, thick and straight, or think and curved cut through the skies, a constant reminder that war was all around, inescapable. \n\nThe Americans were becoming careless. Their superiority was now rarely questioned. Throughout May we continued to lose our strength, and now hordes of land- and carrier-based planes roared over Kyushu unchallenged. They chased anything they saw: horse carts, bikes, cows, and would often make repeat firing passes at fields of thick grass when they thought they saw somebody hiding in it. Anything that caught an American pilot's attention was mercilessly strafed. Our supply lines were completely paralyzed during the day. Factories did not receive their raw materials, and could not send their products out. Entire cities were starved of food and basic supplies.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nGradually heavy bombers stopped being the main threat, and now our hardest battles are the against the US Army fighters, the P-51s. These planes are fast and nimble, and every pilot we meet seems to be capable and very aggressive.\n\nOn the 25th of May we received scramble orders. Radar reported a single-engine formation fast approaching, presumably P-51s. We were to take to the air and remind the Americans that the land underneath was still called the Empire of Japan. \n\nYour Objective: intercept enemy fighters.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Shiden Kai.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:35 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 1,500 meters.\n\n
