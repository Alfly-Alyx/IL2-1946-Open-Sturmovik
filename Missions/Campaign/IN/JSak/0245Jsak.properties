Description \nFighters!\n\nDate: 24th of June, 1944\nTime: 07:00\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Iwo Jima\n\nWe didnt enjoy the quiet for long. We hoped for at least a little breather after the Philippine Sea affair, but the Americans had other plans. It became clear yesterday that they were preparing to strike Iwo.\n\nThis was my first meeting with the new American carrier-borne fighter, the Hellcat. It was as maneuverable as our new Type 0, but a more powerful engine gave it better vertical performance. Flown by a good pilot, this was a formidable weapon. \n\nOur spirit helped us prevail the other day, and the enemy was defeated. I hoped the future engagements would turn out the same way, and I would not fail my wingmen, my commander, and my country.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThe alarm sounded again on the morning of the 24th. A large enemy flight was reported, approaching Iwo from the West. Immediate squadron scramble was ordered. Billows of volcanic ash began to spread over the air strip. Sakae engines began to growl, and one after another our fighters began to line up for take-off.\n\nYour Objective: stop the enemy.\n\nYour Flight: 12 x Navy Type 0 Carrier Fighter Model 52b.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. After take-off head South-West, aiming to gain as much altitude as possible. Visually locate enemy planes and destroy them. \n\n
