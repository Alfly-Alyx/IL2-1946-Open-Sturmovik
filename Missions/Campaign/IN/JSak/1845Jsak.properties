Description \nOver the Harbor\n\nDate: 2nd of June, 1945\nTime: 18:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Fukuoka\n\nDespite the incessant air attacks, our regiment still remains battle-worthy. Throughout the month of May we continued to strike back during the Kikusui Operation.. Hundreds of airplanes took off from Kyushu bases, all flown by pilots who knew for them there would be no landing, and set course for Okinawa. Each had but one goal: to locate an American warship and to explode into it. A single good hit was often enough to take a whole ship out of action. Of course, these operations cost us dozens of planes and dozens of lives, but they cost the enemy even more, both in equipment and in manpower. We were able to damage or sink plenty of destroyers and cruisers, and even a few aircraft carriers were damaged to the point where they could no longer launch their hated stubby dark-blue planes. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThe end of May in Japan is never a good time for aviation. Typhoon season begins to get serious, and storms begin to hit Japanese mainland one after another. We get to sit inside all day, listen to the storm outside, and ponder our fates.\n\nOn the 2nd of June a typhoon passed us by, and the sounds of airplane engines once again filled the air over our field. We knew the enemy was not far away. Two flights were lined up on the runway, and their fully equipped pilots sat in their cockpits, stewing in the summer heat. Scramble orders would be a blessing.\n\nJust a few minutes later we received reports of several formations of carrier fighters to the South. We were immediately ordered to intercept the group, presumably heading to Fukuoka. Army Type 5 Fighters would once again be joining us in the fight.\n\nYour Objective: protect the Fukuoka harbor from enemy air attack.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Shiden Kai.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:00 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 4000 meters.\n\n
