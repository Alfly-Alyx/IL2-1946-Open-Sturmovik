Description \nNew Weapon\n\nDate: 21st of March, 1945\nTime: 17:40\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kanoya\n\nUnfortunately most of the air groups were unable to mount a serious challenge to the Americans. Japanese Army pilots, poorly trained and equipped, suffered heavy losses. Few of the new Army pilots ever returned from their first dogfight. Most didn't even see their attackers.\n\nAmericans, on the other hand, were eager to claim victories. They chased down our pilots with incredible tenacity, apparently resolved to gain their five kills and earn the coveted title. Some didn't seem to care for their objective or for their squadmates, instead breaking formation and chasing any plane in sight. Stories like that only increased our disdain for the enemy.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nIn the afternoon Admiral Ugaki himself decided to mount a return strike on the American carriers. The 711th Attack Hikotai based at Kanoya would play the leading role. 711th's pilots were trained on the fearsome new weapon, the Ohka glider with five rockets up its tail, and a ton of explosives in its nose. \n\nAccording to the daring plan, the Type 1 land attack planes would carry their flying bombs in broad daylight, and launch them from 6,000 meters when they sighted the enemy carriers. \n\t\nImmediate cover for the strike group would be provided by Type 0's of the 721st Kokutai, the Heavenly Thunder. Myself and other 332nd pilots would fly to the north of the main thrust, clearing the air of any enemy planes, and also serving as an early warning and air control unit. \n\nUnfortunately, take-off orders were received somewhat late, and we'll have to take-off and proceed to target at full throttle in order to catch up with our package.\n\nYour Objective: take-off, climb to 6,000 m, and clear the designated air space.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Raiden Model 33.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:40 heading South-East. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 6,000 m. Stay on course.\n\n
