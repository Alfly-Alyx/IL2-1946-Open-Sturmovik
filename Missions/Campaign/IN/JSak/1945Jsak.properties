Description \nLast Chance\n\nDate: 3rd of June, 1945\nTime: 07:20\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Fukuoka\n\nHeavy fighting over Kyushu continued throughout the day. Enemy carrier fighters just kept on coming. I got a phone call from my father again. I reported that I was doing well, and father told me that he witnessed an air battle recently between six Americans and two of our planes. Apparently, our pilots were too hot for the Americans to handle. My father saw two of the invaders go down, and the rest escaped, with our two victories fighters returning to their base with the entire town cheering below. \n\nOne of the Americans bailed out right over Fukuoka. No one is sure what he was hoping for, but when he landed he got what he deserved. The entire town seemed to have gathered waiting for him to descend. An army patrol soon dispersed the crowd and dragged the battered pilot in for interrogation. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nOver the course of the day several Americans bailed out over the ocean, and are now floating in our coastal waters.\n\nIn the early morning the Americans restarted their rescue efforts. Coastal watch observed flying boats circling over a wide area, with a fighter screen above them. Our HQ decided to respond to such a blatant challenge, and sent up a large strike group to shoot down the flying boat.\n\nVirtually every flyable plane our squadron had was scrambled. I was to lead a smaller group - just me and a wingman - and attack the flying boat herself; while a larger flight of four was to fly above us and engage the enemy escorts.\n\nYour Objective: destroy the enemy flying boat.\n\nYour Flight: 2 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Shiden Kai.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nThe second flight is already in the air. Take-off at 07:30 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 1,000 meters.\n\n
