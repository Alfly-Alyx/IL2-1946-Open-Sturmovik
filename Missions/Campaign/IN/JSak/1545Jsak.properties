Description \nA Fresh Start\n\nDate: 19th of April, 1945\nTime: 16:55\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Fukuoka\n\nAmerican bombers are becoming increasingly accurate. We are suffering horrific losses in manpower and equipment at all Kyushu airfields. The survival of our entire air force, Navy and Army, is now uncertain. We had many vital tasks, and were failing virtually each one of them. There was the enemy fleet at Okinawa, B-29 bombers roaming all over Japan, and there were rumors of an impending amphibious landing on Kyushu itself. \n\nSome hard decisions had to be made to safeguard our resources. As soon as we landed, the fuel tanks of our planes were emptied, and the planes were pushed away from the airstrip and masked a few kilometers away. This meant that we could no longer be scrambled at a moment's notice, but at least this kept our aircraft away from low-flying attack aircraft that seemed to be constantly overhead. Our production numbers kept waning, and each airworthy aircraft was worth its weight in gold.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nSignificant changes happened in my own life as well. My victories did not go unnoticed, and I was invited to join the elite 344 Kokutai at Fukuoka. The air group was equipped with the brand-new Shiden Kai fighters, heavily armed, maneuverable and very fast. This was our answer to the P-51, and what an answer it was! \n\nOn the 19th of April my section was lined up on the runway, and we jumped into our cockpits. My first mission in the new plane was of incredible importance. Several admirals from the IJN General Staff were inspecting the airfield, and we had to protect the airspace over their heads. The unfamiliar cockpit, different shape of the seat under my back, and a flight stick of a new shape in my fist, all that awakened the long-forgotten fan blades of fear in my stomach. \n\nYour Objective: defend the airfield at any cost.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Shiden Kai.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:55 heading South-East. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 1,000 meters.\n\n
