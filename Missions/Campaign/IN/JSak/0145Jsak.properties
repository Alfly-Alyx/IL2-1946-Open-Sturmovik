Description \nSupport\n\nDate: 22nd of June, 1944\nTime: 06:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Iwo Jima\n\nBy the summer of 1944 it was becoming increasingly clear that the Japanese Empire's defenses were bursting at the seams. The might of the American war machine was overwhelming. Island after island, atoll after atoll, the Empire was shrinking. The heart of the Empire, the home islands, were almost within range of the approaching Allied troops. Japanese intelligence continuously failed to estimate the direction of each new thrust. Mounting an adequate defense was becoming increasingly more difficult.\n\nIt took two years after the much touted Dolittle raid for the next US bomber to be seen over the Japanese islands. This time they were the mighty B-29 Superfortresses, launching from bases in mainland China. By late June of 1944 the US Navy brought more shame to the Japanese fleet, defeating us in the Philippine Sea. This could only mean more danger over the home islands. We prepared for the fighting ahead.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nOur group of thirty pilots was transferred to Iwo Jima a couple of days ago. Many of our pilots had little experience, but we were lead by veterans like Saburo Sakai and Tadashi Nakajima, so we managed to fly for 500 miles over stormy seas without getting lost.\n\nAt Iwo we reported to our new commander, Lieutenant Sadao Yamaguchi, and became a part of the Fighter Squadron of the famed Yokosuka Kokutai. The 301st and the 252nd Kokutais were also at Iwo, with about 80 fighter planes total, all tasked with defending the tiny island against enemy bombers.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nEarly this morning the Iwo Jima airspace was patrolled by two pairs of Type 0 Fighters. At 05:55 the first pair was preparing to end its patrol, and requested landing clearance. At 05:58 the second pair reported being bounced by four to six enemy fighters. They needed help. Lieutenant Yamaguchi ordered me to take up four more Type 0s and help our comrades.\n\nYour Objective: gain altitude and relieve the 0 fighters currently fighting against numerical odds.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Navy Type 0 Carrier Fighter Model 52b.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:00 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Continue monitoring the situation while in the air. Additional flights of US planes may join the dogfight.\n\n
