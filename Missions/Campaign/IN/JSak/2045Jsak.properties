Description \nVIP\n\nDate: 26th of June, 1945\nTime: 18:10\nWeather: Haze\nLocation: Fukuoka\n\nOkinawa fell... In the second half of June organized resistance virtually ceased, and US marines were able to advance on the island with ease. \n\nNow the situation became even worse. Receiving such a large island, the Americans immediately turned it into a giant airbase. Back in April, as son as they landed, the enemy began moving their tactical aircraft to Okinawa, and Kyushu fell within their operating range. For the first few months, they rarely flew so far, as there were plenty of things for them to do right over Okinawa. But now, with Okinawa full in their hands, and special attack units a constant threat, American tactical aviation fully switched over to Kyushu. \n\nThis nightmare started several days ago, and there is no end in sight.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nImperial General Headquarters sent a representative to our airfield. He advised us that we have to hide all our planes and virtually cease our defensive operations until the barbaric enemy comes to our shores and begins an amphibious assault on Kyushu. Then we would load our planes with bomb, and shower the enemy ships with a glorious torrent of thousands of airplanes. \n\nHowever, these orders apparently did not apply to escort duties for high-ranking officers. While the rest of the squadron's planes were being camouflaged far away in the countryside, me and my wingman were ordered to escort our guest in his flight back from Fukuoka.\n\nYour Objective: escort the Strike Group South representative.\n\nYour Flight: 2 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Shiden Kai.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:10 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 2,500 meters.\n\n
