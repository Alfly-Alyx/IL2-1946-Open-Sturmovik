Description \nCatastrophe\n\nDate: 5th of April, 1945\nTime: 18:50\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kanoya\n\nIn March the Americans finally defeated the heroic defenders of Iwo Jima, the last soldiers on the wretched island we failed to protect 9 months prior. The island, a barren rock, was incredibly precious. Located right along the B-29 route from Marianas to Japan, this island gave hope to the crews of damaged bombers. Now they had a chance to survive battle damage or equipment failure.\n\nSoon after the defeat at Iwo our intel reported that American single-engine fighter bombers were moved to the island. This was horrible news. Now the Japanese homeland was within range of escorts and fighter-bombers that were not tied to aircraft carriers.\n\nOn the 11th of April the Americans began their amphibious assault on Okinawa. According to reports, the initial landing was met with no resistance, and the Americans took over the airfields in the middle of the island. This would not go unpunished. Tokkotai units were ordered to take to the air, and make their final plunge onto American warships supporting the land units. The horrific new weapon would punish the occupants. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nSpecial attack units that took off from South Kyushu would likely be a source of great worry for the Americans. We fully expected them to retaliate by sending large bomber formations against our airbases.\nAs the sun was setting on April 5th, we received our orders. I was to lead a flight of J2M5s to intercept a bomber formations heading to Kanoya.\n\nYour Objective: intercept enemy bombers.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Navy Interceptor Fighter Raiden Model 33.\n\t\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:50 heading South-East. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your target altitude is 3,200 meters.\n\n
