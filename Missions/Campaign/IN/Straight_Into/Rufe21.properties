Name Rufe21
Short Straight Into an Icy Hell - Rufe 21 by Zeus-cat\n
Description Mission: Rufe 21\n\nDate: December 21, 1943\nTime: 1118\nWeather: Hazy\nVisibility: Good\nTemperature: -19C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\n\nAfter bombarding the American airfield, the Hashimoto returned to Hikuru Base to re-supply.  Aviation fuel is running low aboard the Hashimoto and General Tanaka has refused to share any with you.  To save fuel you have ordered your aircraft, as well as Sho-i Fujida\u2019s, to be lowered into the sea by crane.  Sho-i Suetsuna will launch from the catapult and you and Sho-i Fujida will then launch from the water to meet him.  This will save considerable fuel as it takes twenty minutes to reload the catapult.  The three of you will head to the American base to bomb the repair crew that you\u2019re certain is trying to repair their radar.\n\nSCRAMBLE!\n\nThe aircraft flying patrol over Hikuru Base report the base is under attack!  Somehow, the Americans knew that our radar had failed due to the extreme cold and took the opportunity to launch an attack.\n\nIt will take at least 20 minutes to prepare Sho-i Suetsuna's aircraft for launch once you are airborne.  Do not expect him to reach the base in time.  General Tanaka has scrambled additional fighters to intercept the Americans, but that will also take time.  \n\nLAUNCH!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach Hikuru Base\nSecondary Objective: Land at Hikuru Base and taxi to one of the seaplane piers.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
