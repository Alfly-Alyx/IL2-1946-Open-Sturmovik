Name        Straight Into an Icy Hell - A Japanese Seaplane Campaign
Description This campaign is a sequel to Straight Shot.  It is not necessary to play Straight Shot before playing this campaign, but it is recommended.\n\nTo enhance this campaign, I have included a number of outstanding skins by vpmedia, vpmedia, jesters-ink, ronnco, Li'l Pup and leadspitter, Imme and Beebop.  Please install these prior to starting the campaign.\n\nWith your success in the South Pacific, you are now in command of the seaplane chutai on the IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto.  You will be catapulted off the cruiser to undertake various missions including intercept, recon and attack in your A6M2-N seaplane (Allied designation Rufe).  You have moved from the warm waters of the South Pacific to the frigid, barren wasteland of the Aleutians.  You left Tokyo Bay three weeks ago and are now approaching your new base of operations with two freighters of vital equipment and supplies.  For the next two weeks the IJN Hashimoto will be temporarily assigned to Hikuru Base to protect the army engineers building the airfield there.  No one on board the Hashimoto likes the idea of being under the command of an army general, but these orders come direct from the highest levels in Tokyo.  We need to establish an airbase in the Aleutians to disrupt American shipping to and from the Soviet Union.\n\nUp until now, the Aleutians has been a theater where tired men operate tired equipment that should have been stricken from the inventory years ago.  With the arrival of the Hashimoto and the two freighters of supplies for Hikuru Base, the balance of power in this region will certainly shift in favor of the Emperor!\n\nYou need to select the highest rank available (Dai-sa) as you will need to command AI aircraft in several missions.  You may select whatever difficulty settings you want, but I recommend Full Real (use th emini-map option if you must, but turn icons off).\n\nPlease be aware that you will see a 30% reduction in your score at the end of each mission as water landings, even for seaplanes, are regarded as crash landings unless you land at a designated seaplane base.\n\nIf you enjoyed this campaign, look for my other Rufe campaign, "Straight Shot", at airwarfare.com\n\n "Straight Into an Icy Hell" was brought to you by Zeus-cat.
