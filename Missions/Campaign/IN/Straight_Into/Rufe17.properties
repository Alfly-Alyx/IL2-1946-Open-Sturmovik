Description Mission: Rufe 17\n\nDate: December 18, 1943\nTime: 0731\nWeather: Clear\nVisibility: Good\nTemperature: -15C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\nLoadout: 2 x 60kg bombs\n\nThe weather may have cleared, but the tactical situation is as unclear as it ever was.  Several enemy aircraft have been spotted this morning - naval aircraft.  There is no doubt that an enemy aircraft carrier is operating in this area.  \n\nGeneral Tanaka at Hikuru Base has ordered a dive-bomber attack against the temporary bridge that the Americans have built.  He feels that the continued disruption of the enemy's efforts to rebuild the airbase must be our first priority.  You disagree with his assessment of the situation; you feel that the enemy base won't be operational for several days at best and finding the enemy carrier should be the first priority.  An enemy aircraft carrier poses a huge danger to both the Hashimoto and Hikuru Base.  \n\nHowever, you have learned not to voice your opinions too strongly to General Tanaka.  He has already ordered the attack against the bridge and made it clear that no other plans will be considered.  You and Sho-i Suetsuna are tasked with flying over the bridge a few minutes after the attack to assess the damage.  \n\nYou saw a number of fuel trucks crossing the bridge when you flew over it yesterday.   You decide to load up both seaplanes with bombs to target fuel storage facilities at the base.  You and Sho-i Suetsuna have strict orders from General Tanaka not to deviate from your flight plan and to only make one pass over the bridge.  Your recon flight path takes you right over the airbase, so you aren't exactly disobeying orders by taking bombs.  You expect the fuel storage tanks to be in the same location as they were before the first ones were destroyed; near the road on the northern side of the airstrip.  \n\nAfter the attack, return to the Hashimoto, land, and taxi to the starboard side for pickup.\n\nThrottle up and prepare for launch!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the enemy airfield\nSecondary Objective 1: Destroy the fuel storage facilities at the base.\nSecondary Objective 2: Recon the damage from the dive-bomber attack.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
