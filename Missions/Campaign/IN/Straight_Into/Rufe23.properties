Description Mission: Rufe 23\n\nDate: December 22, 1943\nTime: 1718\nWeather: Snow\nVisibility: Poor\nTemperature: -10C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\n\nThe bold American attacks against Hikuru Base and the Hashimoto over the last several days have been repulsed with significant losses to the Americans.  Almost all of the torpedo bombers were shot down in their attack on the Hashimoto.  Many of their dive-bombers were lost in the attack on Hikuru Base. \n\nJapanese losses in the torpedo attack on the Hashimoto were relatively light, with one notable exception.  In a cruel twist of fate, General Tanaka\u2019s claim that Hikuru Base was safe from torpedo attack was proven untrue.  A damaged American torpedo bomber flew directly over the Hashimoto and dropped its torpedo on Hikuru Base.  The only casualties were General Tanaka and his driver when the torpedo landed on the generals\u2019 staff car and destroyed it.\n\nThe snow squalls have allowed the Hashimoto to get close to the enemy ships unnoticed.  Once we were spotted, both American destroyers turned to attack the Hashimoto so that their carrier could escape.  Their brave sacrifice did little to slow down our great ship, but we did lose sight of the fleeing carrier.  Before we lost her, the Hashimoto did get in several hits that must have damaged the AAA fire control on the carrier.  AAA fire from the damaged carrier should be minimal, find the carrier and help the Hashimoto sink it.  \n\nIntermittent sightings by our range finders indicate the ship is somewhere ahead of us bearing 290 degrees.  You are carrying bombs and are to attack the carrier to destroy any aircraft that may be on her deck waiting to launch.  Your Sho-i will provide cover from enemy fighters.  Look for AAA fire from the carrier if it spots your wingmen.\n\nOne of the American destroyers is ripping itself apart just off our port side as you prepare for launch.  You will fly right over the stricken ship; take care not to get hit by flying debris from any of the explosions.\n\nBecause of suspected enemy submarine activity, the Hashimoto will be taking evasive action until she returns to the base.  She won't be able to stop to recover any aircraft.  You need to return to Hikuru Base and land at the pier.  A landing zone has been established for you in the water by several utility boats from the base.\n\nThrottle up and prepare for launch!\n\nPrimary Objective: Intercept the American aircraft carrier\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the American fighters\n
