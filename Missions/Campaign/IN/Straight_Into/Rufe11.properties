Description Mission: Rufe 11\n\nDate: December 10, 1943\nTime: 1922\nWeather: Hazy\nVisibility: Good\nTemperature: -7C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\n\nGeneral Tanaka, the commander of Hikuru base, has deployed small groups of men to look for enemy activity.  After meeting the general, you immediately realize that his reputation for being a difficult man to deal with is well deserved.  At first, he refused to even meet with you.  Apparently, naval personnel really do rate lower than Americans or Britons in this man's eyes.  Pilots are especially despised, and there are rumors that he has said that he would rather be captured by New Zealanders, or even Australians, than fight alongside navy pilots.\n\nOne of the general's scouting patrols, group 3, has radioed in that a number of enemy cargo planes are flying due east in sector AN/21.  It is likely that they are headed for the area around AX/22; as the Americans have dropped anti-ship mines from their cargo aircraft in this area over the last few months.  With the arrival of the Hashimoto, they are likely to be dropping more mines to restrict the Hashimoto's movements.\n\nGeneral Tanaka sneers at you as he hands over the report from group 3 and says, "Underwater mines are not the concern of the Imperial Army.  If they pose a threat to your precious little boat, you deal with the enemy aircraft!"\n\nYou leave his office seething, but you must put your feelings aside as you have a mission to fly.  You have ordered Sho-i Suetsuna to accompany you on today's mission.  He is on the catapult and will launch as soon as he gets the word from you.  \n\nOn your way to Hikuru Base's pier, you spot two Zero pilots from General Tanaka's command and convince them to fly their "training" mission in the general direction that you will be flying.  Hopefully, they will be able to come to your aid if the enemy cargo planes are escorted by fighters.\n\nGeneral Tanaka did tell you one useful piece of information before you left his office; the American cargo planes must be below 750m to drop their mines, so you should stay low to intercept them.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach sector AX/22\nSecondary Objective: Land and taxi to the starboard side of the Hashimoto.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
