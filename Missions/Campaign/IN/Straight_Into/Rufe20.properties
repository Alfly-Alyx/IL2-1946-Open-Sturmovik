Short Straight Into an Icy Hell - Rufe 20 by Zeus-cat\n
Description Mission: Rufe 20\n\nDate: December 20, 1943\nTime: 1725\nWeather: Hazy\nVisibility: Good\nTemperature: -5C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\nLoadout: 2 x 60kg bombs\n\nThe radar station at Hikuru Base became operational last night.  They immediately picked up a radar signal from the American airbase.  The American radar is operational, but our Intelligence officers assured us it wouldn't be ready for at least two weeks!\n\nGeneral Tanaka was furious with his intelligence officers and with you.  You don't even bother to ask what you have done anymore to make the general mad.  Being in the same room with him is usually enough.\n\nThe general immediately ordered an attack against the radar installation.  He wants Hikuru Base to have the only "ethereal eye", as he calls it, in the area.\n\nHis plan is a good one, but not surprisingly, you and your fellow seaplane pilots will shoulder most, or more likely, all of the risk.  The general will send a squadron of D3A1s with escorts towards the Americans at 3,500m as a feint to draw the American fighters away from the radar station.  You and Sho-i Fujida and Suetsuna will fly in at low level and bomb the radar station.  \n\nThe radar station is located on the coast just north of the airfield.  Expect AAA to be guarding the radar station.\n\nYou should immediately return to the Hashimoto, land, and taxi to the starboard side for pickup. The Hashimoto will be moving SSE into the inlet.  The ship will start shelling the airbase once you are in view.  The brief bombardment will likely cause little damage, but will remind the Americans that the Hashimoto rules the waves for hundreds of kilometers.\n\nThrottle up and prepare for launch!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the enemy airfield\nSecondary Objective 1: Destroy the radar installation (you will see a ship destroyed message as a US Pilot is hidden inside the building)\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
