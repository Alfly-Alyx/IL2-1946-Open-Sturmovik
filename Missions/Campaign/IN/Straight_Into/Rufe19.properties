Description Mission: Rufe 19\n\nDate: December 20, 1943\nTime: 1020\nWeather: Hazy\nVisibility: Good\nTemperature: -9C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\n\nThe chance to attack the American carrier was lost when General Tanaka refused to look at your recon mission report.  The general's face was as red as the Rising Sun flag when he glanced at the report and saw that you reported the enemy carrier was exactly where he refused to look.\n\nThe general's aide told you that the general threw your report into the fireplace immediately after you left his office.  Six hours later the general launched his own search planes to cover the same area you had searched, but the American carrier had slipped away.\n\nToday, the general has sent all of his aircraft out to search for the American carrier.  Therefore, it has fallen to you to escort the two freighters away from the island.  After flying for three hours over the freighters, you turn back to base when you started to run low on fuel.  Sho-i Suetsuna is preparing to fly out to relieve you.  \n\nALERT!\n\nOne flight of General Tanaka's search planes has just engaged two flights of American dive-bombers and their fighter escorts heading towards the freighters.  General Tanaka's fighters will do their best to destroy the escorting fighters, but the dive-bombers are continuing on their way to attack the freighters.  Turn around and fly due north to return to the freighters.  Disrupt the dive-bomber attack any way you can.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the cargo ships\nSecondary Objective 1: Protect the oil tanker\nSecondary Objective 2: Protect the cargo ship\nSecondary Objective 3: Land at the seaplane pier at Hikuru Base.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
