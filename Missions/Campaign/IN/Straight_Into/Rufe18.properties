Short Straight Into an Icy Hell - Rufe 18 by Zeus-cat\n
Description Mission: Rufe 18\n\nDate: December 19, 1943\nTime: 0735\nWeather: Hazy\nVisibility: Good\nTemperature: -9C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\n\nThe threat of a torpedo attack from the American carrier is too great to ignore, so the Hashimoto has returned to Hikuru Base.  You reluctantly take one of the ship's boats and travel over to Hikuru Base to confer with General Tanaka.\n\nWith the American airbase no longer an immediate threat, it is time to find the American aircraft carrier.  General Tanaka, has launched search aircraft to look for the American carrier.  However, he has ignored your suggestion that search aircraft be sent west and northwest of Hikuru Base.  He feels certain that the American carrier is north or northeast of Hikuru Base.\n\nYou decide that General Tanaka is probably correct concerning the location of the American carrier, however, it is only prudent to search the areas west and northwest of the base to make sure the American carrier is not hiding there.  You inform the general that you and Sho-i Fujida will fly recon over these areas.  The general was already very upset with you for taking bombs on your last mission.  When you suggested you and a Sho-i would fly recon missions along with his pilots he threw you out of his office and refused to allow any Zeros as escorts.\n\nYou return to the Hashimoto by boat and tell Sho-i Fujida that the general has honored the two of you by having you fly two of the recon missions.  Your altitude will be 2500m for this mission.\n\nBoth of your Sho-i are ignorant of the backstabbing politics that often takes place at the higher ranks and are truly proud to serve the Emperor, yourself and even General Tanaka.  You warn Sho-i Fujida not to engage any enemy aircraft as no escorts are available from Hikuru Base.  You simply tell them that the general feels that escorts are unnecessary for naval pilots.  Sho-i Suetsuna and Fujida assume you mean that naval pilots are so good that they don't need escorts and you see no reason to tell them the truth.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the first recon sector\nSecondary Objective: Land near the Hashimoto and taxi to the starboard side.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
