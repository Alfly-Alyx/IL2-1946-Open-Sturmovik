Short Straight Into an Icy Hell - Rufe 14 by Zeus-cat\n
Description Mission: Rufe 14\n\nDate: December 14, 1943\nTime: 1137\nWeather: Snow\nVisibility: Poor\nTemperature: -7C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\nLoadout: 2 x 60kg bombs\n\nYou and Sho-i Fujida will conduct a low-level armed recon mission this morning.  Takeoff and follow the river due south until you reach the road at the southern edge of sector AM/20.  Turn east and follow the road for approximately 30km.  Your altitude will need to be 250m or less to see anything because of the poor weather.  Fly as far east as the village in sector AP/19.  The village has been abandoned and should be of no interest to us, but a quick look for enemy activity is advisable.\n\nAfter the attack, return to the Hashimoto, land, and taxi to the starboard side for pickup.  Note the location of the ship on your maps as the captain has moved the Hashimoto into a sheltered area to provide calmer water for your landings.\n\nOne final note: the small village in sector AL/19 is to be avoided at all costs.  For reasons we don't yet understand, the village is heavily defended with large and small caliber AAA.  Flying over this village would be suicidal.\n\nThrottle up and prepare for launch!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the recon area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy any enemy units you encounter.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
