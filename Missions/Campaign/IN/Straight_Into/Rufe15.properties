Short Straight Into an Icy Hell - Rufe 15 by Zeus-cat\n
Description Mission: Rufe 15\n\nDate: December 14, 1943\nTime: 1619\nWeather: Snow\nVisibility: Poor\nTemperature: -3C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\nLoadout: 2 x 60kg bombs\n\nSho-i Fujida's plane was damaged this morning, so you will be flying this mission alone.  Sho-i Suetsuna will be flying CAP over the Hashimoto.  You are instructed to call each other for help if needed.\n\nThe bridge just east of the enemy airbase needs to be destroyed.  This is the only road that the enemy can use to send supplies to rebuild the destroyed airbase.  Destroy the bridge and the battle for this area of the Aleutians will be over.  \n\nThe bridge may be difficult to locate, so you may need to follow the road to the target.  An altitude of several hundred meters is advisable because of the poor visibility.  No AAA is expected until you reach the bridge, but you should expect the Americans to have the bridge heavily defended.  Destroy the bridge on your first pass and immediately return to the Hashimoto.  After landing, taxi to the starboard side for pickup.\n\nJust like this morning, you must avoid the village in sector AL/19.\n\nThrottle up and prepare for launch!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the target area\nSecondary Objective: Destroy the bridge.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
