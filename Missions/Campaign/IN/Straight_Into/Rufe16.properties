Name Rufe16
Short Straight Into an Icy Hell - Rufe 16 by Zeus-cat\n
Description Mission: Rufe 16\n\nDate: December 17, 1943\nTime: 1823\nWeather: Snow\nVisibility: Poor\nTemperature: -3C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\nLoadout: 2 x 60kg bombs\n\nThe storm that raged for the last three days has kept all of our aircraft grounded.  You now think it is safe for an experienced pilot to attempt a flight.\n\nOnly you are launching as you don't think either of the other pilots can handle the weather, not to mention that both of them have been seasick for the last two days due to the storm.\n\nYou think it is very important to take a look at the American base and the bridge area.  The Americans have proved to be a very resourceful enemy and a worthy opponent.  They have had three days free from air attacks to repair the bridge and you have no doubt that they wasted little of that time.  \n\nYou are carrying two bombs to drop on a target of opportunity, but your primary goal is to recon the airbase and the bridge.  If there are significant enemy forces in the area, do not linger over the target.  Note the location and types of enemy  forces and we will send bombers to destroy them.\n\nOnce again, Sho-i Suetsuna insists that he saw enemy carrier-based aircraft on his last mission.  He wants you to keep an eye out for enemy aircraft.  You don't believe he saw any enemy aircraft, but you assure him that you can handle any enemy fighters that show up.\n\nAfter the attack, return to the Hashimoto, land, and taxi to the starboard side for pickup.\n\nThrottle up and prepare for launch!\n\nPrimary Objective: Recon the enemy airfield\nSecondary Objective: Recon the destroyed bridge\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
