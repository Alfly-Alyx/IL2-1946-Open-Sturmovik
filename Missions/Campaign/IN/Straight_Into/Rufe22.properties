Description Mission: Rufe 22\n\nDate: December 22, 1943\nTime: 1017\nWeather: Clear\nVisibility: Good\nTemperature: -9C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\n\nWith the total loss of the Hikuru Base radar station, General Tanaka is even more paranoid than ever about another surprise dive-bombing attack from the Americans.  He has ordered his patrolling fighters to fly above 4,000m to ensure that any dive-bombers are intercepted at high altitude.  You tried to tell General Tanaka that the next attack would almost certainly be a torpedo attack.  General Tanaka smiled at your comment and told you that he felt it unlikely that Hikuru Base would be attacked by a torpedo planes.\n\nYou gave the general an obligatory bow befitting his rank and left his office before your anger got the better of you.  The general still refused to share any aviation fuel with you even though he knows the Hashimoto has less than 1,800 liters of aviation fuel compared to the Hikuru Base quartermaster\u2019s estimate of 91,000 liters in their storage tanks.\n\nAn hour later, your three aircraft rock gently at the Hikuru Base seaplane docks.  Their full fuel tanks only cost you two bottles of saki and half a dozen fresh apples from the Hashimoto\u2019s galley.\n\nSCRAMBLE!\n\nIncoming enemy torpedo planes have just been spotted due south of Hikuru Base!  They are after the Hashimoto!  In this narrow channel she won't be able to maneuver; so she will be an easy target for the Americans!  Maneuver around the landing craft and get airborne immediately!  \n\nPrimary Objective: Intercept the attacking torpedo bombers\nSecondary Objective: Land near Hikuru Base and taxi to one of the seaplane piers.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
