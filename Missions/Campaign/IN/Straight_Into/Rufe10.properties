Short Straight Into an Icy Hell - Rufe 10 by Zeus-cat\n
Description Mission: Rufe 10\n\nDate: December 9, 1943\nTime: 0907\nWeather: Snow\nVisibility: Poor\nTemperature: -7C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\n\nIt has been 21 days since we left port.  After making several diversions to confuse the enemy of our intentions, we are approaching our new base of operations.  Three companies of Imperial Army engineers have carved out an airfield in this unforgiving wilderness and created Hikuru Base.\n\nAs you must have noticed over the last few days, the weather is just as much, if not a greater enemy, than the Americans.  Crash in the sea and you will likely freeze to death in a few minutes.  Crash out on the frozen wasteland and you will survive for a few hours before freezing to death.  Therefore, if your plane is damaged, you must immediately withdraw from the fight and return to the ship or to Hikuru Base.  The number of aircraft available to us is severely limited; we can't afford to lose one unnecessarily.\n\nLaunch from the ship and fly to the island on a course of 215 degrees.  Your best altitude will be over 300m to get you out of the rough air, but below 800m to keep you below the clouds.  When you reach the island, turn to the northwest and fly around the island to familiarize yourself with it, staying about 1 km out to sea, so that the coastline is easy to see.  Make sure you turn on your navigation lights as the AAA gunners on the island are supposed to open fire on any unidentified aircraft.\n\nYou are to land at the seaplane base on the southern tip of the island.  Taxi to the long pier and tie up there.  The Hashimoto, the freighter and the tanker will join you in another three hours.  Sho-i Fujida and Sho-i Suetsuna will follow you at 30-minute intervals.\n\nThrottle up and prepare for launch!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the island\nSecondary Objective: Land at the seaplane base and taxi to the long pier.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
