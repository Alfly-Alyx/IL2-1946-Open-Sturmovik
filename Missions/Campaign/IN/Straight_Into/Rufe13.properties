Short Straight Into an Icy Hell - Rufe 13 by Zeus-cat\n
Description Mission: Rufe 13\n\nDate: December 12, 1943\nTime: 0835\nWeather: Sunny\nVisibility: Clear\nTemperature: -25C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\nLoadout: 2 x 60kg bombs\n\nNow that the storm has broken up, General Tanaka's plan will be carried out.  His plan calls for all three seaplanes from the Hashimoto to be used.  You will be going in ahead of the main strike force to destroy the enemy AAA at the base.  You will lead Sho-i Fujida and Sho-i Suetsuna to the base.\n\nSho-i Suetsuna will launch from the catapult while you and Sho-i Fujida will launch from the water.  Regrettably, Sho-i Fujida's aircraft was only removed from storage and assembled last night.  It is still in the tropical paint scheme and can't be repainted in this cold weather.\n\nThanks to your recon efforts yesterday, we know the enemy has two 25mm light AAA guns and three heavy machine guns on each side of the runway.  The guns are arranged MG, 25mm, MG, 25mm and MG; with the MGs closer to the runway and the 25mm guns further out.  The 25mm guns are the major concern.  All four of them should be destroyed before the D3A1's attack.\n\nYou are tasked with destroying the guns on the left hand side of the runway.  Your two wingmen will destroy the guns on the right hand side.  Look for small fires that the gun crews will have burning.  Once the storm ended last night, the temperature dropped far below freezing.  They need these fires to keep their guns from freezing.\n\nYou will have time for several passes, but you must be clear of the enemy base by 0845.  At that time a squadron of D3A1's from Hikuru Base will be dive-bombing the airfield.  You will have approximately three minutes to destroy the AAA guns before the D3's arrive.  Hopefully, Sho-i Fujida will be able to launch from the water quickly this time.  His water takeoffs have been very poor lately.  If he has problems, you and Sho-i Suetsuna will need to circle back and wait for him so that all three of you attack together.\n\nYou may return to the enemy base after the dive-bombers attack to strafe any remaining targets.  Only do so if the threat from AAA is minimal.\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the enemy airbase\nSecondary Objective: Destroy AAA at the enemy base\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
