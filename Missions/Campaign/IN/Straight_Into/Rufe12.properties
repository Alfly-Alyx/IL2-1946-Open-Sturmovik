Name Rufe12
Short Straight Into an Icy Hell - Rufe 12 by Zeus-cat\n
Description Mission: Rufe 12\n\nDate: December 11, 1943\nTime: 1658\nWeather: Snow\nVisibility: Poor\nTemperature: -11C\n\nHomebase: IJN Heavy Cruiser Hashimoto\nLoadout: 2 x 60kg bombs\n\nAn attack was planned against the American airbase, but the heavy snow is preventing the launch of any of General Tanaka's aircraft from Hikuru Base.  The snow is piling up faster than the snow removal crews can push it off the runway.  On good thing about this, the snow will be causing the Americans the same problem.\n\nFortunately, the snow isn't a problem for the Hashimoto and the captain has moved the ship quite close to the American base.  You will launch immediately and fly due south to the American airfield.  Use your bombs and cannons to attack the enemy bulldozers clearing snow from the runway.  Visibility is still poor, so if you stay below 100m, you should be able to reach the base undetected.\n\nFlying in such poor weather has you concerned, but you smile as you realize the poor weather will also give you an excellent reason to stay away from General Tanaka's office.  \n\nSho-i Suetsuna launched from the catapult 20 minutes ago and is waiting to join you for the attack.  \n\nAfter the attack, return to the Hashimoto, land, and taxi to the starboard side for pickup.\n\nYou are seated in your aircraft going through your pre-flight checklist when one of the catapult technicians runs over to your aircraft and hands you a message.  General Tanaka has just sent an urgent radio message to the captain of the Hashimoto.  You and Sho-i Suetsuna are to cancel your mission and will scout the locations of enemy AAA, specifically the 25mm guns.  Apparently there will be a full-scale attack on the American base once the storm breaks and the runway at Hikuru Base is cleared of snow.  \n\nYou rip the message in two and throw it out of the aircraft.  How dare that man order you to cancel your mission!  You are still going after the American bulldozers whether General Tanaka likes it or not!\n\nThrottle up and prepare for launch!\n\nPrimary Objective: Reach the enemy airbase\nSecondary Objective 1: Destroy the enemy bulldozers clearing snow off the runway.\nSecondary Objective 2: Note the location of all 25mm AAA guns.\n\nSkin: vpmedia_A6m2_rufe\nMarkings: off\n
