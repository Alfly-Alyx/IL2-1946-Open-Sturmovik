Name 20-Return to Attu
Short Bomb Attu.\n
Description You have been lucky enough to escape from Attu. Your fellow comrades made history in one of the bravest charges of our imperial troops ever commenced when fighting off the odds. But they could not turn the fate into their victory. \n\nThe Americans and Canadians had conquered the whole island in just two weeks. With Kiska isolated from our supply convoys, our general staff had decided to remove our soldiers from that island. By 28 July all troops had been moved.\n\nThe American invasion on 15 August was unopposed. Our enemies were surprised they did not meet any resistance at all - they had expected to encounter the same hand-to-hand combat our soldiers showed them in Attu...\n\nBut we are not finished here...\n\n11 October 1943\n\nYou have been chosen as the guide for our bombers. You have spent much time in the Aleutians, so we can exploit your experience.\n\nFly to Attu and bomb the American airstrip there.\n\nThis mission starts and ends in the air.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis is the last mission. Hope you enjoyed this campaign and this beautiful map.\n\nCracken, June 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
