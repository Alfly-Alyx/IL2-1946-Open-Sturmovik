Short Escape from Attu.\n
Description 11 May 1943\n\nAlarm! The American invasion has started! \n\nThey are shelling our troops, they have destroyed all our planes but one! Yours!\n\nUnfortunately, it has not been refuelled completely.\n\nAnyway, fly away as fast as you can. Try to land near one of our subs - the fuel is not sufficient for a flight to Kiska, though...\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select skin A6M2-N_81.Kokutai_IJNAAF_Alutians1943_BL.bmp\n
