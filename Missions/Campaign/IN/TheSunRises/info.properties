Name        The Sun Rises over the Aleutians
Description This is a 20 mission semi-historical static campaign for the IJN over the Aleutians in 1942-43.\n\nAlthough the Aleutian campaign is rated as one of the "minor campaigns" of WW 2, nevertheless it is very special - the only air clashes over America in WW 2 took part just right over the Aleutians, not only  the Americans but the Canadians too had the opportunity to fight against Japan and lastly, the flyers had to fly in very changeable weather conditions. Also, the Americans got their first fully flyable 'Zero' from the Aleutian island of Akutan.\n\nI am obliged to thank agracier for having created this splendid map.\n\nGood luck when flying, and do not forget "that's the weather conditions that prevail":-)\n\nTurn "instant success off".\n\nSelect any rank you like.\n\n Cracken, June 2009.\n\n\n\n\n\n
