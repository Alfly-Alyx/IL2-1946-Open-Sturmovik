Description 26 March 1943\n\nWe have heard on the radio that there is going to be a great battle between Attu and Soviet held Komandorski islands. \n\nOne of our supply convoys has been jumped by Yankees. Fortunately, they are strong enough to put up a very tough fight.\n\nAll they need is an air cover, and that is a task for us.\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease select skin A6M2-N_81.Kokutai_IJNAAF_Alutians1943_BL.bmp\n
