Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++ CLASSIFIED +++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 4th, 1942\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nWake up!\n\nThe enemy has started to land airborne troops at the road Wairopi- Kokoda. The whole operation seems to be of a major scale.\nSince the night numerous transports have dropped masses of paratroopers and material.\n\nThis airborne attack will effect our ongoing operations in a very serious way.\nThe whole supplies for the Etogi front are affected.\nThe enemy must not been allowed to disrupt this important supply line.\n\nIf our troops at Naura can't get supplies in a sufficient mass, Naura can't be taken. At the moment only the enemy has the freedom to use heavy weapons there, because the road is blocked at Etogi. When our stressed supply situation becomes worse, we won't be able to take Etogi and with this Naura won't fall to us. This would bring our whole advance to Port Moresby to an end. \n\nOur main heavy forces are standing in the front at Etogi. \nNow, if we want to counter the American air landing effectively, we would have to bring these forces to the enemy landing zone. \nThis would lower the pressure on Etogi and then it must be estimated that the Americans would be able to hold the village.\n\nOn the other hand, if we would let the heavy forces at Etogi, their effectiveness would quickly become lower in spite of the bad supply situation.\n\nThe head command has ordered the air groups to counter the landing. All air forces are ordered to attack the landed enemy. \nTomorrow the decision will be made if our heavy forces have to be drawn back.\n\nHelp to make this decision unnecessary!\n\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep. \n\nTime: 05:24\nAltitude: 2000m\nFlight: Nagoya- One\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nNight. Fresh winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
