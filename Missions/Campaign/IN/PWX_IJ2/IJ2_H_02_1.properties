Hard fights are raging around the small spot. The important road crossing at Kokoda and Alola is in danger and with it the only road connection to the northwest.\nPort Moresby would be cut off from the only landway to the west of New Guinea.\n\nThe second, central Japanese group is advancing south, along the road Natungo- Jaure. The village of Jaure is short to be reached.\nFollowing this road to the south coast, the Japanese could cut of Port Moresby from the Milne Region.\n\nOur Army's third advance is moving along the northern coast to the east. This group is meeting only weak resistance.\n\nAll in all our ground forces are superior in strengthe to the enemy's\n\nThe situation in the air is somewhat different. \nHere the Allies allocated a sufficient number of additional air units to the airfields at Port Moresby in a very short time.\nNow both side's air forces are roughly equal in strength.\nBecause the operational airspace is very limited in size, bombers have a hard stand. \nYou don't have to wait very long to meet the enemy.\nLosses are high on both sides.\n\nThe airfields around Buna are well prepaired. The Allies made a good job in building them up and our mechanics repaired them in an astonishing short time after their capture.\n\nThis morning you will fly your first fighter patrol.\nFor now you'll stay close to our lines, to become firm with the special situation here.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep\n\nTime: 07:00\nAltitude: 3000m\nFlight: Nagoya- One\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny early morning. Haze.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
