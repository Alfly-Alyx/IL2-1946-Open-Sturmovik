A mistake.\n\nAt the same time two other important things happened at two other places:\n\nAt Alola, the enemy launched a very serious attack to penetrate our defense line. The battle stood at it's high peak, when suddenly the assault was broken off.\n\nWhat did happen?\n\nOur Arapara Group had launched it's attack at the same time the Americans attacked at Alola.\n\nThis Arapara Group attack was a great success.\nWithin three hours the Group managed to break deep into the enemy line. The first enemy hill chain fell within the first 90 minutes.  It's clear that the enemy defense line was thinned out to favour their attack at Alola.\n\nNow the enemy had to decide between two unfavourable options:\nTo take Alola for the loss of Rouna, or to save Rouna for the giving up of the Alola assault.\n\nThe enemy decided to transfer a part of his heavy forces to Rouna to hold on the advance of the Arapara Group.\n\nDuring the time all this happened, the enemy battleships were attacked three times.\nOne of the air raids succeeded in making one of the battleships immobile.\nIn the following hour this ship was sunk and the other ships were attacked two further times.\nAnother attack damaged a second battleship so serious, that a big fire could be observed.\nBut it looked that the two left battleships would be able to get out.\n\nSuddenly, at around 11:00 our Cape Milne commando unit reported a big ship, lying immobile and burning at the south beach of the Milne Cape.\n\nA quickly called air raid succeeded in sinking the second enemy battleship.\n\nIn the afternoon the enemy managed to stiffen his resistance at Alola, clearly with the help of tanks brought on from Alola.\n\nNormally one could say that we achieved a great victory yesterday, but it had to be paid with great losses.\nAt Goodenough, over 40 planes were destroyed by the enemy ship bombardment. Another 37 planes were lost during the attacks on the vessels.\nAt Alola the early enemy assault cost us nearly 2250 men dead, missed or wounded and our Arapara Group lost 1700 men during it's attack.\nAllthough the enemy had great losses too our future plans are affected by these circumstances.\n\nThe whole night and day long was needed to estinguish the fires at Goodenough.\nThe most buildings are damaged or fully destroyed.\nBut the field itself is intact and the planes can be parked.\nMany planes are destroyed and so your squadron lost planes too.\nBefore the enemy attack on Goodenough your Kokutai had 17 planes operational and 8 planes in  the repair service. Today, only 8 planes are left operational and one is beeing repaired.\n\nThe fuel tanks are destroyed and so Admiral Okumura decided that only the most neccessary flights have to be conducted.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep along the coasts of the Islands.\n\nTime: 17:010\nAltitude: 2000m\nFlight: Tatsu- 3\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny afternoon.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
