Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++ CLASSIFIED +++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nJanuary 19th, 1943\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nOur last attack didn't sink one of the battleships but both were heavily damaged. One of the two was damaged so serious, that a big fire in the foreship has emerged. \nThe whole enemy group made it round the Milne Cape but now we got a report from one of our commando groups that a battleship is lying immobilized close to the beach south of the cape. A freighter is lying parallel to the still burning battleship and one destroyer seems to be left there for it's security.\n\nNonetheless it makes a good target now. The actual position of the other ships is unclear at the moment but the burning ship is more than worth the risk of an attack.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nEscort the B5N torpedo bombers on their attack run against the enemy battleship. Attack the destroyer with bombs.\n\nTime: 11:15\nAltitude: 300m\nFlight: Tatsu- 3\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
