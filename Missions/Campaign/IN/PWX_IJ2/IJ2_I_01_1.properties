Since days no attacks were conducted. Wether in the air, nor on the ground. Both sides seem to need time to recover.\n\nIn the east the front line has come to a standstill in front of a a very well built enemy defense line. \nOur troops suffer from the greatest difficulties to bring up supplies to the front.\nOnly in the north and in the south our lines are well enough connected with a road.\nThe enemy selected the position of his defense line very well. Along the whole line the Collingwood Bay - Abau road is going behind it.\n\nIn the west both sides are sharing the same difficult supply situation. Great parts of the line can only be supplied by foot and muli- transport along bad ways through the dense djungle. These transports are difficult enough during the good weather period. At the moment, the transports are exhausting.\n\nWith the begin of the rain period, both sides have reinforced their activities behind the opponent's lines in strength.\nNumerous commando groups were deployed behind the enemy lines.\nThese small units are supplied by air. \nTransport planes are conducting occasional flights behind the enemy lines to drop off supplies. Float planes fly deep into enemy territory to land on one of the many waterways to deliver men and material directly. The bad weather with it's poor visibility gives them good protection against their opponent's fighters.\nThe transport airmen love the bad weather. The fighter pilots hate it.\nBut fighter patrols over own territory must be conducted, at low altitude in rain and through dangerous winds.\n\nAlong the coasts of the mainland and the islands both sides are delivering supplies with ships and boats. Again the weather is giving them very good protection against bombers. Here  fighters have to fly patrols too, to probably find and attack the enemy's transport vessels.\n\nAllthough the air war is somewhat pausing, \nlosse still have to be suffered.\nNot the enemy fighters are the most dangerous threat, now the weather is taking it's toll.\nNew Guinea is like phantom which suddenly feeds it's hunger for lifes.\nHow long can somebody survive this?\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nPatrol along the Collingwood Bay coast and look out for enemy activity\n\nTime: 05:15\nAltitude: Very low.\nFlight: Tatsu- 3\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nRain. Strong winds. Poor visibility.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
