But when the weather will clear up and ground operations will start again, the covert operations will be decisive.\n\nWhatever one side is planning, these informations will be the basis for any operational decision.\n\nThe Americans must not allowed to get a full picture of our troop's  organisations and deployment. Thats why the head command has to order low altitude search and destroy missions. \n\nThe dangerous weather circumstances have to be ignored. Losses through accidents have to be taken..\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nSearch the inner valleys of Ferguson Island for enemy activity.\n\nTime: 06:00\nAltitude: very low\nFlight: Tatsu- 3\n\nWeather Forecast:\nEarly morning.
