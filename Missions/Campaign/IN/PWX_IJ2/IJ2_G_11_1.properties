The American numerical superiority is too big.\n\nIf there are coming more attacks, our air forces on Guadalcanal and Tulagi won't be able to withstand the enemy any longer. Hardly 25% of the fighters are operational. In every hour you loose good friends and comrades.\n\nThe conterattacks on the enemy carriers were unsuccessful. \nAt Tulagi a last attempt to attack the enemy flattops with floatplane bombers is beeing organized.\nThat's difficult, because the H8Ks are spread all around Florida Island.\n\nAnother last attack will be performed from Lunga too.\nThere a number of B5Ns is still hidden near the airfield.\nUntil then you are ordered to keep in the air and attack the enemy where you can find him.\n\nYou don't believe that all this will turn the tide.\nSooner or later the eastern Solomons will fall to the enemy.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep south of Tulagi.\n\nTime: 10:15\nAltitude: 3000m\nFlight: Nagoya- Three\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
