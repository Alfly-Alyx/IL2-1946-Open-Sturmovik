Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nAugust 28th, 1942\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe weather is worsening.\n\nOur advance on the ground is making good progress.\n\nKokoda is taken. Now the battle for Alola is raging.\nIn the center our forces have reached Laruni. There a fierce battle has begun too. The Americans are defending the village with braveness.\nIn the northeast Embeso is short to be reched.\nIf the battle is going on like now, eastern New Guinea will fall into our hands in the coming weeks.\nBut the losses are much higher than expected.\nThe Americans are fighting stubborn. They're a much harder opponent than anticipated. Our losses are high. Every assault on an enemy position is a costly undertaking. It will be of great importance that our Head Command can reinforce our troops soon or the advance will sooner or later come to a halt.\n\nIn the air the war is of equal intensity.\nThere are so many planes of both sides in the air that nearly every second mission leads to a fight with the enemy.\n\nAt the moment your squadron is ordered to secure the airspace over the Wairopi area.\nMore than once enemy planes were sighted over that place.\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep.\n\nTime: 09:18\nAltitude: 2400m\nFlight: Nagoya- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nStrong winds. Satisfying visibility.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
