Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern Solomons\nGuadalcanal / Tulagi / Savo\n\nJuly 24th, 1942\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nYou're still alive!\n\nThe Americans had not more than eight fighters in the air to secure their ships. You had great luck!\n\nThe enemy is supressing any operations from Lunga.\nPermanently enemy fighters are patrolling over the base. The air defense in Lunga had taken severe damages. Only a few machine guns and one 20mm gun is operational.\nThe American bombers have started to attack our isolated positions in the south of Guadalcanal.\nIt seems that they have no further interest to destroy Lunga totally. \nOnly three fighters are left at Lunga together with a small number of transports and other planes.\n\nDue to the fact that enemy fighters are over the field, no plane can take off without beeing shot down immediately.\n\nBut a flight of transport planes must get out. A stronghold in the south of Guadalcanal needs supplies desperately. The L2D transports are waiting for a chance to get up.\n\nAt the moment only four Wildcat fighters are over the base. You are ordered to get up and attack them to give the L2Ds their awaited chance to get up unharmed.\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nAttack the enemy fighters over Lunga.\n\n\nTime: 15:28\nAltitude: 4000m\nFlight: Nagoya- Three\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
