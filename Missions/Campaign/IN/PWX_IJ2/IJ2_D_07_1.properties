Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nTarawa Atoll...... March 18th, 1942\n\n==================\n\nSITUATIONAL REPORT:\n\nThe detection of an American aircraft carrier in the theater of operation came as a big surprise. With it, the enemy air forces are more than doubled in strength.\nThe plan for the assault on Tarawa has become obsolete through this unexpected situation.\nThe Task Force has to deal with a different threat now.\nThe Admiral has changed his plan accordingly during the night.\n\nThe Americans attacked the Kaga Group two times yesterday. \nIt seems that both attacks were conducted by planes from Tarawa. Until now no attack was conducted by the enemy carrier. This will of course change today.\nAllthough the Kaga had to take some damage, the group is still fully operational.\nWith the exception of the sinking of one destroyer, the Americans weren't able to harm the Operation at the loss of numerous dive- and torpedo bombers.\n\nYesterday afternoon, the Hiryu arrived. Just at the right moment.\n\nUnfortunately the combined air raid by the Hiryu's and the Kaga's B5Ns against the enemy carrier was'nt successful. More than 50% of the B5Ns were lost. \n\nToday the distances will be shorter and the D3As will be able to reach the enemy.\n\nNow, after the night, the battle starts from scratch. The position of the enemy carrier can only be estimated.\nLong before sunrise, several reconaissance planes were send out to detect the American carrier.\nIt has to be taken into account that Tarawa still could have enough planes left for a second raid against us.\n\nThis situation brought the Admiral to the decision, to regroup the force:\n\nA Battleship Group was formed. It is ordered to steam toward the estimated position of the enemy's carrier group.\n\nThe Kaga Carrier Group was reinforced with the Hiryu and will follow the Battleship Group in some distance to enable the fighters to cover the battleships and itself.\n\nThe Landing Group is steaming behind. It will conduct the landing operation tomorrow morning.\n\nAt this moment it's clear that both sides will have to reconnoitre the position of the opponent's carrier group.\nThis is the time for forward fighter area control missions to interrupt the enemy's reconnaissance.\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nFighter Air Patrol over the Battleship Group.\n\nTime: 07:31\nAltitude:  5000m\nFlight: Kobe- Two\n\nWeather forecast:\nStormy. Satisfying visibility.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
