Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nMarianas Islands, Guam.\n\nDecember 28th, 1941\n\n==============================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nWhen you left Guam twenty days ago, you left it as a green rookie.\nNow, after this short time you come back as a fighter ace.\nYou were credited with five aireal victories.\nFive victories against an enemy who refused to give up. Five hardly earned victories.\n\nIn only twenty days your life changed totally.\nIn only twenty days you were turned from a green rookie into a fighter ace.\n\nYou ever dreamed of this. You wished to become a hero more than anything other.\nNow you're a hero.\nYou should be lucky... proud.\nBut you're not.\n\nGoing into action as a fighter pilot is not such fun as you thought.\nYou shot down the enemy. But you feared him. Everytime. \nBefore taking off you were short of becoming crazy.\nFear. Fear for your life.\nIn the air everything went automatically. You shot down planes, not humans.\nMore than one time only luck saved your life.\nThen, when you came back your victories became bitter. \nWhen you saw how many of your comrades didn't come back you fears were ready to attack you again.\n\nNo more than 35 percent of both carriers airmen survived this little Wake expedition. \nEven the fighter's losses exceeded 50 percent.\n\nIt's not a question of ability, braveness or intelligence to survive, it a question of mathematics and luck. It's a question of statistics if you survive or not.\n\nTwenty days ago you dreamed of a life as a hero.\nNow you only dream of a life of a living man.\n\nIn the morning the Akagi Group reached Guam.\nBefore the ships enter the port, the air groups have to transfer to Apra Airbase.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n--------------------\nLand at Apra Airbase.\n\nTime: 07:45\nAltitude: 500m\nFlight: Aomori- Three\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
