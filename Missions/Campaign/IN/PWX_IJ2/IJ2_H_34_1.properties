Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++ CLASSIFIED +++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 12th, 1942\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nOur ground troops opened a corridor to the encircled company in the centre of the Wairopi pocket.\n\nSince one week this small contingent of infantry was able to hold it's position against all American attempts to destroy them.\nThe fightings in the pocket demonstrated the value of infantry fighting in dense woods.\n\nSince the time, when Arminius beated the mighty Roman Legions in the dense forests of Germania, forest- war is writing it's own rules:\nHand to hand combat. Visibility ranges less than 30 yards. Invisibly defenders. Attackers of company size running in ambushes layed by only a handful of men. \nWhen the fights start, the opponents are so close to each other that heavy weapons can't be lead and can't be used without hitting own men.\nThis leads to the paradox situation that even a well equipped attacker, nominally superior in firepower, has to suffer from a lack of firepower in these circumstances.\n\nSo it was possible that only about 120 men were able to hold the forest against a far superior opponent. \nAnd this fact favoured the American infantry  in holding the Etogi- Naura- position.\n\nNow the Wairopi pocket is falling. \nWhen the airborne troops are wiped out south of the Wairopi- Kokoda- road our forces will have reopened the supply line to Etogi and Kokoda.\n\nThe enemy airborne troops are coming more and more into a desperate situation. \nOur task will be to keep the enemy air support away of the battle.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep\n\nTime: 06:28\nAltitude: 1500m\nFlight: Nagoya- One\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
