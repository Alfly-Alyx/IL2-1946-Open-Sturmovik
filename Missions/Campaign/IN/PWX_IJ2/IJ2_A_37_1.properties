How you feel in battle. Before battle.\nYou told him that your fears could make you crazy before you meet the enemy. And how these fears are suddenly blown away when you finally meet him.\nYou told him that you feel shame for this fear.\nHe smiled at you and for a moment you looked into sad eyes. And he said: 'You're alive! Do you really believe that all the others don't have fears?'\nYes, you believe!\nYou're the child of a family with an old military tradition.\nA tradition of fear? \nHe told you that he talked about this with some of his comrades. Everybody has fears. Everybody is fearing the enemy even if they don't get tired in saying that they don't. Even Japan's greates heros are full of fear.\nIt's not our tradition to talk about that. But it's real.\nAfter a while he said: 'Care good for your fears. If you loose them, you're a living dead.'\n\n\nThe Taiho is reaching Guam.\nAs a happy, living man you enter your plane and prepair for take off to transfer to Apra Airbase.\nIn front of you Ayao is sitting in his plane, looking around and for a short moment you met his sad eyes.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nLand at Apra Airbase.\n\nTime: 15:45\nAltitude: 500m\nFlight: Tatsu- One\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
