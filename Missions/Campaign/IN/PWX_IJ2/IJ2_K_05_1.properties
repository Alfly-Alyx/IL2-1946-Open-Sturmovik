And New Guinea is a permanent problem to be supplied.\nThe US Navy has to ship their supplies from Pearl Harbor sailing a wide bow south of Tarawa to pass Santa Cruz south and then to enter the Coral Sea.\n\nTarawa in Japanese hands is a very unfavourable cornerstone every American supply convoy mut pass at great distance.\n\nOn the other side, our supplies to New Guinea are very much affected by American submarine activities.\nAs long as our transport ships are sailing alone, without cover from frigates or destroyers too much ships are falling victim to enemy submarines.\n\nOur Naval Command is just about to imitate the enemy convoy system, where transports are sailing together beeing protected against the enemy submarines by small contingents of escort vessels.\n\nThe main target must be to secure own transports while sinking substantial tonnage of enemy supply shipping.\n\nSo Admiral Yamamoto has ordered offensive supply line interdiction conducted by carrier groups.\n\nSince one month the Hiryu is attacking enemy shipping south of Tarawa.\n\nNow a second carrier is ordered to assist the Hiryu in this task.\n\nThe new carrier Taiho which was completed in February is ready for this mission.\nBecause it's air group isn't just build up, your squadron was ordered aboard the ship.\n\nTwo weeks ago you were instructed in your new assignment. \nThree hours ago the Taiho Group left Peleliu.\n\nYour squadron is aboard the carrier.\nNow Capt. Nango, Capt. Ogiya, Capt. Kondo and you have to transfer to 'your' carrier.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n--------------------\nLand at the Taiho.\n\nTime: 07:18\nAltitude: 500m\nFlight: Tatsu- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny early morning.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
