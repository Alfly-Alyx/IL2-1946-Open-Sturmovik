Description April 10th\nThis will be a first waepons test. By now your  conversion went very good and since we are still waiting for the engines we will continue our testprgram by gliding. You will be towed up and do a gliding attack on ballons at 1200m hight. Be carefull and turn away soon enough, we don't want the valuable prototype damaged. The targets are in the clearing northeast of the base. Try to aproach both targets if you have enough speed.\n\nskin: J8M1 Shusuei\n
