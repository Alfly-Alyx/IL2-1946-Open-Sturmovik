Description Officer, you have been selected for a very priveleged task. You are to treport to a newly formed unit near Miyakonojo. I don't know exactly what is going on there, talk has it that it is about prototype airplanes of a strange sort, top secret. But since this orders come from high command this for sure is a special honor for you.\nYou can't take your fighter with you, we need them here but we have an older A6M prepared as a liaison aircraft for you to use. Whatever this secret unit is about, make Japan and your old commander proud.\nBanzai!\n
