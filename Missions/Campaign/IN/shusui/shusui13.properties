Description August 14th\n\nListen up, this is from the latest secret reports. Obviously the poisonings after the Hiroshima incident where caused by radioactivity. Similar cases where registered after your dowing of the B-29 on August 9th. The conclusion is that the American where trying to use a new nuclear device but it failed, we don't know why in Hiroshima but are sure of the reason in Nagaskai. The Shusui came just in time it seems! Secret service believes the Americans will take time to reconsider their activities after these failures. This should give us valuable time. \n\nAttention, attention:\nA B-29 raid headed for Nagasaki or Omuta. Three Interceptors take off!\n
