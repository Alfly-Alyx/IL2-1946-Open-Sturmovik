Description June 5th\n\nEnough for the gliding for now. Today you will test the engine of the shusui for the first time. Again you will be towed to altitude with 30% fuel. This is for safety reasons. Climb to 7000 m and level flight, we need this data quickly I think the engineers are about to complete the work on the engines. \n\nWhat about the exposion yesterday? This was the other engine prototype on the testbed so be carefull with this one, it is very valuable. I repeat myself on this... be carefull, flyer.\n\nskin: J8M1 Shusui\n
