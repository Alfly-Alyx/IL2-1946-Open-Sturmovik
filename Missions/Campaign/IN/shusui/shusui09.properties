Short losses\n
Description July 11th\n\nAn hour ago we lost readio contact with Cdr. Inuzuka, who was testing the prototype. He reported engine trouble. His last postion was at AS14, we need to send out search teams but the G4M is down due to maintanace. You have to take a fighter.\n\nThe good thing is, the Shusui can be landed on any open field. Find him, maybe he needs assistance.\n\nA6M5b\nmarkings on\n\n
