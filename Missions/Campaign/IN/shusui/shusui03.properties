Description Welcome at the Miya testflight center. You have been selected from all navy pilots to join this new unit because of you great achievements and abilities. You wonder what this is all about and I can tell you now. This is the place where the future of Japans airpower is shaped. \n\nHere we will test and develop the latest inventions and products of our aviation industry to destroy the enemy over our homelands and drive them back into the sea!\n\nThis is the testunit for the Shusui rocketfighters, planes of unsurpassed speed and firepower whith which we can take down the american fortesses.\nYou are here to help us make this weapon fron-ready.\nAnd now off to the hangar, you seem to be curious what this is all about. I will show you your new comrades and our prototype of the N8M-1 Shusui rocket interceptor.\n\nYou have to bring your frontline knowledge into this operation. We need the input not only of test pilots but from flyers who are going against the enemy. You are to bring theis weapon to the front.\n\nThe characteristics are like this, we will have rocket power to start and climb like nothing else but only fuel for 5-10 minutes to attack with the mighty 30mm guns. Then you have to glide back to landing. This is back to basics of flying. We have some issues with the engines and the fuel which is very dangerous. It constis of two components called Ko and Otsu, be very carefull with it, it can dissolve a man to nothing. - What are you looking at, Samurai?! - We have some parts and drawings from Germany available but there is still much work to do. To get accomodated to the airframe you will do glidetesting first. Go ahead and do a seat fitting.\n\nThis bird is very different from any other plane, since it is tailless. The flyability is very good, be carefull with slow tight curves though. You will be towed to a hight of 3500m and glide back to the airfield. Try a little manouvering.Landing speed is at about 210 km/h at a flat angle. Don't loose altitude too fast.\n\nskin: J8M1 Shusui\nmarkings off\n
