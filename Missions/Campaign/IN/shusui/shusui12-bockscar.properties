Description August 9th\n\nWe have finally gone operational on August 2nd. Your wing was transfered to Omura to fight the Sasebo-Nagasaki-Omuta triangle and the flightpath northwards. There are only five planes delivered until now and these are far from being flawless, fuel is a constant problem too but action has begun. \n\nWaether was not too good for quite some time now. Three days ago a single B-29 dropped a huge object of some sort on Hiroshima but obviously missed, probably due to cloud cover and high altitude. There are only sparse reports since this is subject to investigation and top secret but a few things are known. The object crashed into the beach without detonating. It is believed that it was supposed too be a new weapon that malfunctioned. There is not much left of the object to investigate and the people first on site got strangely sick. So maybe this is some sort of chemical weapon? Hiroshoma is off limits until further notice!\n\nRadio coming in: A single B29 aproaching at 5600m. We can get this one!\n\nskin: H8J1 509th blank\n
