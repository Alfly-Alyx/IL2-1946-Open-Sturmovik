Name 21 Jul 1942
Short A beachhead patrol over Buna\n
Description 21 July 1942 0800\n\n     A few instructions of note have come down from Tokyo. One, we will no longer fly to Port Moresby. Crossing the Owen Stanley range is now against regulations. Two, every pilot will wear his assigned parachute. In the coming months, we will need every pilot. If you go down in enemy territory, you will find your way back to our lines, or you will deal with your shame as necessary.\n     From now on, we will fly patrols to give the Army air cover, and to continue to destroy enemy aircraft as they appear. \n     And the last matter, the sighting of American Navy planes by LT Yamashita should not raise alarm with any of you. Our intel officer says that this concurs with his assesment that most land based aircraft have been destroyed, and that the enemy is bolstering his land based air forces with carrier types.\n\nTake off and climb to 1500m. Turn to heading 335 and proceed to sector AO25 while climbing to your patrol altitude of 3000m. The first leg of your patrol will be 130 at 160kt for 5 min. In sector AQ23, Your next leg will be 215 at 160kt for 3 min. In AP22 turn to 310 at 160kt for 5min. When your reach AN24, you will turn to course 045 at 160kt for 3 min. Repeat this patrol pattern 1 time. If you have found no air opposition, you are clear to return to the airfield.\n\nGood Luck today!\n\nMission notes: Scattered clouds. Don't forget your parachute.\n
