Name Dec9'41
Short Brave Pacific storms to strafe Clark Field.\n
Description Dec 9 1941 1000\n\n     The attack yesterday on Clark Field went well. Our losses were low in comparison to the enemy. As you may have noticed, it is storming outside. The bombers have been grounded today but the fighters are going to fly.\n     It is important that we get a good assessment of the damage of yesterday's strike. If there are any targets remaining, do your best under the conditions to destroy them. While missions are important, and we must keep up the pressure on enemy forces, the main priority of this mission is to assess damage and return with all aircraft and pilots intact.\n     Having to fly under the storm to navigate will use too much fuel to return to Tainan. An Army airfield on Formosa (D5) will provide a radio beacon for your Sentai. Refuel there and return to Tainan. We have another mission scheduled tomorrow.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nMission Notes: Thunderstorms over the whole region. Trust your instruments. Your compass will be unuseable due to turbulence. Home base radio beacon frequency is WPT 7. A destroyer is on station in D3 if you must ditch.\n
