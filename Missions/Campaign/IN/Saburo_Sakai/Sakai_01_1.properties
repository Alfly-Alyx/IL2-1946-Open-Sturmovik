Short The opening strike of WWII in the Philipines.\n
Description Dec 8, 19411000\n\n     The time has arrived! At this very moment, all of our forces are engaged in combat all across our empire. Now we will do our part. \n     Our target is Clark Field, the largest American airbase in the Philipine islands. We expect heavy air opposition as the enemy has been alerted by attacks at their other installations. \n     Petty Officer Sakai, you will take your Zeros to a point near Clark Field at 5000m. Orbit there and make sure that the bomber's attack is unimpeded. After all air opposition is destroyed, you are cleared to strafe the airfield to augment the bombing strike.\n\nBanzai!\n\nMission Notes: Weather over target is few clouds. Home airfield is heading 040 from the target.\n\nPlayer Skin: bRz-Saburo Sakai.bmp\n
