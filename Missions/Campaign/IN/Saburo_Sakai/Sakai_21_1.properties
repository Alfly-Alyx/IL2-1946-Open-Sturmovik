The maintenance officer has also informed me of the scheduled completion of seven overhauls currently underway.\n     It looks as if the number of serviceable bombers will increase in the next couple of days also.\n     Todays mission is a recon over Port Moresby to asses the effectiveness of the action of the past few days.\n\nTake off and climb to 1500m on the runway heading. Turn to 260 and climb to 4000m. You will note the state and complement of all the airfields in sectors AC16, AC15. When this is complete, you are cleared to recover on heading 060 from sector AC16.\n\nGood luck.\n\nMission Notes: Scattered low clouds. Be aware of your fuel status.
