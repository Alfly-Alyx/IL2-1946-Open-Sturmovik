Name 17 Apr 1942
Short A Bomber escort mission over New Guinea.\n
Description 17 Apr 1942 0630\n\n     Reconnaissance aircraft have reported an ever growing stream of supplies flowing into the facilities at Port Moresby. This is unacceptable.\n     Your group will fly high cover at 6000m for a group of Type 1 bombers that have been assigned to destroy the harbour facilities at Port Moresby. This escort configuration differs from what we have done in the past, but intel says that this is the best way to stay a step ahead of advances in enemy aircraft technology. Maintain your altitude as much as possible. Do not dive after these new aircraft. Stay above the bombers and make the enemy climb to you.\n\nClimb out on runway heading until you reach 1500m. Turn to 190, climbing to 2000m. Then turn to 240 climbing to 3500m. Meet the bombers at AM21 and continue on their navigation.\n\nMay Japan exist for ten thousand years!\n\nMission Notes: Weather is scattered clouds. Expect AAA and enemy aircraft over the target area. Home airfield is 055 from target. Recovery frequency is WPT 9.\n\nPlayer Skin: vpmedia_A6M2_Rabaul.bmp\nMarkings: off\n
