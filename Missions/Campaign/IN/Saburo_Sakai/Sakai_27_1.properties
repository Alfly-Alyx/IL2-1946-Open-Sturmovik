Short A maximum effort strike.\n
Description 1 Jun 1942 0800\n\n     The time has come! Our victories over the past month have completely destroyed the enemy's fighter force! Therefore, we will be mounting a maximum effort strike against the facilities at Port Moresby. Your flight will go ahead of the bombers to make sure that if there is any opposition, they will be dealt with quickly, and the mission will proceed.  After the bombers have destroyed the port, you will destroy any targets of opportunity you may find. Concentrate on the destruction of guns and other weapons that will cause problems for the liberation forces.\n     You are doing good work. At this rate, our total victory will come soon.\n\nAs you pass the end of the runway, turn to 270 and climb to 1500m. At the southern center of sector AO24, turn to 135 and hold this course at 160kts for 2min. The other members of your flight should be joining you at this time. Turn to 230 and initiate a climb to 5500m. Maintain this heading until you reach sector AH17. Turn to 245 and continue to the target area (AB15). You will keep enemy fighters clear of the bombers until they have been able to release their weapons. When the port facilities have been destroyed, you are cleared to return on heading 060 from AB16.\n\nBanzai!!\n\nMission Notes: Scattered mid-level clouds over the target area. Possible heavy AAA. You are are free of the bombers for manoeuver purposes, but do not stray too far as they must be allowed to drop unhindered. Recovery frequency is WPT 7.\n
