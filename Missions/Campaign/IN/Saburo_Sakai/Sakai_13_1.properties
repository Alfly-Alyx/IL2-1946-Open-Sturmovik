Name 28 Feb 1942
Short An anti-shipping attack in the Far East.\n
Description 28 Feb 1942 1500\n\n     It seems as though we have done our job in Java. There is just one more thing that must be done. An enemy evacuation force is trying to make a break for Austrailia. We will do as much damage to this force as we can, so that we do not have to deal with these ships and soldiers later.\n     Your flight will be providing air cover for a flight of Type 1 bombers that have been assigned this target. Keep an eye out for enemy fighters, as you will be flying lower than your normal patrol altitude. The enemy is sure to do as much as he can to protect these assets! We will win anyway.\n\nUpon reaching 1500m after takeoff, turn to 180 and climb to 3000m. After you reach sector AK15, you will set up an air superiority patrol in this area. Sweep from AK15 to AL14 and maintain presence until the bombers have finished their attack. When the bombers have finished you are clear to recover on heading 360 from AM14.\n\nBanzai!\n\nMission Notes: Low scattered clouds. I-256 is participating in the interdiction and will not be available for sea rescue. Recovery frequency is WPT 5.\n
