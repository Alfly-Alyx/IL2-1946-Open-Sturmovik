Description 4 July 1944 1730\n\n     On June 24, forty-one out of eighty planes were lost. The day before yesterday, twenty out of the forty sent aloft were destroyed. Only nine fighters and eight bombers remain on Iwo.\n     Our defensive battles are over. After the runways are repaired we will attack. We cannot allow your lives to be wasted needlessly by being destroyed in the air.\n     It has been decided what you must do. You will dive together against the American carriers along with your lives and your souls. No fighter will engage an enemy fighter in a dogfight. No bomber pilot will release his torpedo in an air drop. You have your orders.\n\nYou will take off and climb to 3000m over Iwo Jima. Turn 180 and climb to 5000m. When you reach sector CI46 you will search for the enemy fleet and do what is necessary.\n\n" I realize what we are sending you out to do. There is no use in my saying otherwise; you will be flying into almost certain death. But, the decision has already been made. You will go. And my good fortune accompany you."\n(Nakajima to his pilots on 4 July, 1944)\n\nMission Notes: Thunderstorms. 1500m celing. Poor visibility. No need for a parachute today.\n\nPlayer Skin: vp_A6M5_generic2.bmp\nMarkings: off\n\n     \n
