Name 21 Feb '42
Short A ground attack mission in the Far East.\n
Description 21 Feb 1942 0630\n\n     The results of the operations of late against the Dutch airfield at Surabaya have been nothing less than amazing! We have, in a short two weeks, reduced the available enemy fighter force to next to nothing. While recon planes have reported small numbers of new British and American aircraft, these are obviously hasty replacements flown from other parts of the world in a futile attempt to stifle our planned Java liberation.\n     Petty Officer Sakai, the airfield that you found during yesterday's mission will be today's objective. You will join with a flight of 12 Type 1 Army bombers and a few of our friends from the Kaohsiung wing to destroy the last remaining fighter aircraft know to be in the area.\n\nMaintain the runway heading as you climb out to 1500m. Turn to heading 190 while continuing to climb to 2500m. You will meet with the rest of the strike group in AJ18. From there you will climb to 4500m and follow the bomber's navigation. When the attack is complete, and all air threats are neutralized, you are clear to recover on heading 015 from sector AI8.\n\nMake the Emperor proud!\n\nMission Notes: High scattered clouds. Always know your fuel status. I-256 is in sector AI11, Yukikaze is in AK12 for sea rescue. Home airfield is 020 from target area, 360 from Port Dickson. Recovery frequency is WPT 8.\n
