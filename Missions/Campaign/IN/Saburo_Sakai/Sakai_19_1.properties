Description 29 Apr 1942 0730\n\n     It's the Emperor's birthday!! Anybody with culinary skills has gotten up early to make us all a feast! While what we have to work with is limited, alot of the items are fantastic!\n     We have nothing but victories to report. The High Command is satisfied that we are crushing the enemy in New Guinea, and that our planed liberation of the southern coast will proceed on schedule. The number of fighters in the air over the Port Moresby area has not changed much, but in the last four days there have been no bombers over Lae at all. We can be sure that our efforts are ...Air Raid!!!...Air Raid!!!... The sentries have sighted a flight of bombers directly over our field! There is no dishonor in going to the shelters at this point.  \n
