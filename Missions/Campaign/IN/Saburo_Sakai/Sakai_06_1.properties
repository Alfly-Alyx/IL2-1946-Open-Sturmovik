It is sure to cause alarm when we arrive over their airfield at such an early hour. The weather is great for flying and no problems are forseen in regards to today's mission.\n     Six aircraft were returned from overhaul yesterday. Your flight will be nine fighters.\n\nOn Takeoff you will climbout to 1500m. Then turn to heading 195 at 3000m. Over the radio beacon in AJ20 you will turn to 190 and raise your altitude to 6500m. Continue on this heading until you reach sector AG6. turn to 090 for sector AI6. You will then continue your patrol on heading 020. Upon crossing the coast you will turn 360 for recovery.\n\nGood luck.\n\nMission Notes: Scattered clouds at 1500m. Fuel conservation is a priority. Recovery frequency is WPT 8.\n
