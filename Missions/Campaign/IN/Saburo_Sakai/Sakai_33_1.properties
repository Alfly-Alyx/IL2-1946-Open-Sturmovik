Name 29 Jul 1942
Short A beachhead patrol over Buna.\n
Description 29 July 1942 1130\n\n     The Army is only 40 miles from Port Moresby! It seems as though our air patrols are allowing the Army to do its job. It was quiet this morning, but we can be sure the enemy will come.\n     The afternoon patrol will be airborne at 1200.\n\nUpon takeoff assume your patro altitude of 3000m. Fly to sector AO23 and begin your patrol. At 160kts, fly 2 minute North-South legs and 3 minute East-West legs. If after 60 minutes you encounter no opposition, return to base.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nMission Notes: Scattered clouds. Even though it is boring to fly patrols, remain vigilant.\n
