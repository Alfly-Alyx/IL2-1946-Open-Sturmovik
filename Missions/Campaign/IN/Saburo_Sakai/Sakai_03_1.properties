Description 10 Dec 1941 0930\n\n     I am relieved to see everybody that made it through yesterdays mission. We are at it again today.\n     When the fog lifts, you will fly back to Luzon and continue air patrols there. We expect light oppositon from Clark Field. It seems that in the face of our overwhelming forces that the Americans have quickly moved all of their assets south to regroup. No matter.\n     At around 1215 there will be a transport convoy that will be passing through sector A5 to B4 at that time. Shift your patrol in that direction, If there are no threats in the area, return and report.\n\nGood luck!\n\nMission Notes: Low altitude cloud cover. Recovery radio frequency is WPT 8. Home airfield is 040 from Clark Field. If you must ditch, one of the convoy escorts (B4) will pick you up.\n
