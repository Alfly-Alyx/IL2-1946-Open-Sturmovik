Name 25 May 1942
Short A high altitude bomber intercept over New Guinea.\n
Description 25 May 1942 0900\n\n     You may have noticed that there is a large amount of Army traffic at Buna. This is because our victory at the Coral Sea has allowed the Army to accelerate it's liberation schedule for the Port Moresby area. The Army has also decided to save even more time by disembarking the liberation forces here, instead of having to steam all the way around New Guinea.\n     Enemy bomber activity has increased over the past weeks, in spite of our continued success in the air. We have overheard on the radios this morning, that a foreward Army unit has warned the Army airfield at Buna of a large incoming strike. Army aircraft are lacking in range. We will intercept the bombers.\n\nAfter your climbout on the runway heading to 1500m, you will turn to your intercept vector 240 and climb to 6000m. Intercept the bombers and destroy them.\n\nGo!\n\nMission Notes: Take care when approching the bombers from the rear, the best method of attack is head-on. Recovery frequency is WPT 5.\n\n     \n
