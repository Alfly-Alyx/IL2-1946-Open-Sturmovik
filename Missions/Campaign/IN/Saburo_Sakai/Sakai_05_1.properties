Name Feb7'42
Short A coastal air patrol in the Far East.\n
Description 7 Feb 1942 0730\n\n     Today, air patrols continue. Fly west and patrol down the coastline for any enemy aircraft or vessels. After the intensity of the last few months of fighting, many of our aircraft are due for overhaul. So today we only have six Zeros for patrol. Again, conditions are not ideal, but we cannot let up on the enemy.\n     B-17s have been seen in increasing numbers throughout the theater so keep an eye out!\n\nTake off and climb to 1500m on the runway heading. Turn to 265, cruise to sector AG22 while climbing to 3000m. At this point you will turn to 180 and cruise to AG19 at 5000m. Your patrol continues at this location on a heading of 165 to sector AL16 at 5000m. If no opposition has been sighted at this time you are cleared to return to base on a heading of 355.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nMission notes: No clouds reported. Home airfield is 360 from Port Dickson. Recovery frequency is WPT 7.\n
