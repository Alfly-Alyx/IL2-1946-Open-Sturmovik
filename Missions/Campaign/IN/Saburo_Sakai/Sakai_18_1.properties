Name 24 Apr 1942
Short A strafing attack on an airfield in New Guinea\n
Description 24 Apr 1942 0730\n\n     Captain Saito has deemed the information gathered during yesterday's flight to be of the utmost importance. The airfields that were observed yesterday appear to be operational ahead of previous estimates. This is unacceptable.\n     15 Zeros will attack the Kairuku airfield. The Type 1 bombers that we normaly fly with are in poor condition, and are thus undergoing maintenance today. Destroy as much as you can.\n\nTake off and climbout on a heading of 310 to 1500m until you reach the western edge of sector AP24. Turn 180 and initiate a climb to 4000m. At sector AP23 you will turn 240 and cruise to your initial point in sector AD16. Attack from out of the rising sun. When the mission objectives are satisfied, you are cleared to return on heading 060.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nMission Notes: Scatterd clouds. AAA is a possibility. If you are hit and leaking fuel, turn immediately for friendly territory. Recovery frequency is WPT 6.\n
