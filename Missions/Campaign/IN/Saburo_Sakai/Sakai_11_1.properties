Name 20 Feb '42
Short A Strafing/Recon mission in the Far East.\n
Description 20 Feb 1942 0630\n\n     Though we suffered some losses, yesterday's mission served its purpose in reducing the number of enemy fighters in the area. Due to our wing's valiant actions, the timetable for the Java liberation has been preserved.\n     Today you will return to Surabaya and destroy any remaining Dutch aircraft. If all air opposition has been overcome, then you have full authority to strafe the airfield. Leutenant Shingo is honored to lead such a fine wing as this. Petty Officer Sakai, keep up the good work.\n\nYou will take off and maintain the runway heading as you climb to 1500m. When you reach AJ22 you will turn to heading 190 and climb to 2500m. 6 Zeros from our neighboring wing will join you in sector AJ18. Maintain your 190 heading and climb to 4500m. When you reach AG6, turn to 090 until you reach sector AI6. If you have satisfied your mission objectives, you are cleared to recover on heading 010.\n\nGood Luck.\n\n Mission Notes: Medium altitude scattered clouds. Mind your fuel status. I-256 is on station in sector AI13, and Destroyer Yukikaze is in AK14 if you are in need of an over water rescue. Home airfield is 360 from Port Dickson. Recovery frequency is WPT 8.\n
