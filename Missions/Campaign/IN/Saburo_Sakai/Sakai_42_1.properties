Short Scramble intercept of strafing fighters.\n
Description 19 March 1945 0600\n\n     Despite these trying times, and the difficulties of war, we now have enough Shidens at Matsuyama to equip 3 squadrons. This should be enough to repulse any attack by the enemy. \n     Due to our lack of radar, our mission this morning will be a combat air patrol in force. Shidens will patrol at altitude and engage any fighters encountered. Zeros will protect the airfield and any Shidens taking off or landing.\n\nTake off and climb on the runway heading to 1500m. Turn to 090 and climb to 3000m. When you reach sector AO9, You will turn to 180 and cruise to AO7. Turn to 270, cruise to AM7. At this time, turn to heading 360, and proceed to AM9. Repeat this box to complete your patrol and then return to base.\n\nGood Luck!!\n\nMission Notes: Clear weather this morning. Possible low altitude haze. Attack any aircraft you see.
