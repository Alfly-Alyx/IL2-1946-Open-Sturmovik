Description 20 Jun 1942 0630\n\n     Good morning men! Recent recon flights have shown that the harbor at Port Moresby is still fully functional. Therefore, we are going back there today to complete the destruction of the harbor.\n     Sakai, your fighters will make sure that the bombers are able to release their weapons with no distractions, to ensure the highest possible accuracy. Try to avoid being drawn away from the bombers, as it is imperative that we do as much damage as possible to these facilites.\n     The enemy is staging a major air power build up in our area and it is up to us to bleed him dry.\n\nAt wheels up, you will turn to course 305 and climb to 1500m. Hold this course until you reach the northern center of sector AO24. Turn to 215. Hold this heading at 160kts for 2min. Turn to 125. Maintain this course at 160kts for 2min. Join with the bombers in sector AO23, and continue on their navigation.\n\nGood luck on today's strike.\n\nMission Notes. Possible heavy AAA. Possible heavy air opposition.
