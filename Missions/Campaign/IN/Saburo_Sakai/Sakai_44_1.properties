Name 7 May 1945
Short Scramble intercept of bombers.\n
Description 7 May 1945 1700\n\n     Our resources are seriously depleted. The war is going very badly. B-29's shower incendiary bombs over every large Japanese city at will. Most of the Army's fighters have been taken out of service, and placed into shelters so that they can repulse the expected American invasion. It is up to the Navy to defend the skies over the homeland. The Americans have resorted to low level bombing to increase the accuracy of their strikes. This is good news. This brings the B-29's right into the teeth of our remaining Zeros and Shidens.\n     Your orders are to destroy every B-29 that dares overfly Japan. I know you will do well.\n\nTake off and climb to 1500m. Turn to 165 and climb to 3500m. Your intercept vector will be 110 at 4000m.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nMission Notes: Scattered clouds. Radio beacon is out of service.\n\nPlayer skin: vp_A6M5_Saburo_Sakai.bmp\nMarkings: off\n\n       \n\n     \n\n     \n
