Description 19 Apr 1942 1730\n\n     Good news Sakai, we have just recieved an allotment of factory fresh aircraft. As our older Zeros are taken out of service for overhaul, and our new aircraft are inspected and prepared, we will be in good shape for serviceable aircraft.\n     Our campaign is going very well. More supply ships and troops arrive every day. More and better airfields are being built. Enemy forces appear to be overstretched and in a defensive mode. While many... What!... Pilot's, put down your food!! We have word of bombers at approximately 100km southwest and closing. Get to your planes!! \n
