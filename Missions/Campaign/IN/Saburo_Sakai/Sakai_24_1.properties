Description 17 May 1942 0730\n\n     Good morning pilots. Today, details of our Navy's amazing victory of May 8 over America's ships and planes was sent in a fleetwide message from High Command. Our carrier aircraft sank one large carrier and damaged another, as well as many other smaller ships destroyed. Our losses were negligible.\n     Our mission this morning will be a strafing attack on the bomber field at Port Moresby. We will fly with a Kokutai from a neighboring airfield. Concentrate on destroying the bombers that have been making our nights miserable. Today our Navy's victories continue!\n\nClimb out on the runway heading to 1500m. Turn to 235 and climb to 4000m. Maintain this course until you reach your initial point in sector AC15. Conduct your attack from out of the sun. When the attack is complete, you will turn 360 from the bomber field and conduct a low altitude high airspeed egress from the target area. When you reach the northern edge of sector AC16 climb as rapidly as possible to 4000m and recover on a heading of 060.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nMission Notes: No clouds in the target area. Heavy AAA is expected. Gunnery is paramount. Do the most you can and get out quickly. Fly the profile outlined in the briefing, keep your people together on egress, and don't try to do too much. Recovery frequency is WPT  6.\n
