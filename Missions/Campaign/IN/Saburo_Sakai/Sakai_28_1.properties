Name 16 Jun 1942
Short A fighter sweep over Port Moresby.\n
Description 16 Jun 1942 0630\n\n     More of the same for us this morning. Even though we are inflicting grievous casualties on the enemy, his fighters are still encountered in high numbers. With the smashing victories of May 8 and June 4, this is sure to be a desperate final effort on the part of the enemy. Tokyo has told us that the victory at Midway was so complete, that the island is no longer important to occupy, as there are no longer any threats in that area. Those forces will be disembarked here, so that the timetable for the Australian liberation can be further advanced.\n     Today, 21 Zeros will fly to Port Moresby with the sole objective of downing enemy fighter aircraft. Do not waste ammunition on strafing, as it is just as important to down the pilot as well as the plane.\n\nClimb out on course 270 to 1500m. Turn to 235 and climb to 4000m. You will cruise on this course until you reach sector AC15. Turn to course 350 and proceed to sector AB17. If you have encountered no enemy air opposition at this time, you are cleared to recover on heading 065 from sector AB17.\n\nMay good fortune find you on this mission!\n\nMission Notes: Possible heavy air opposition. Be aware of the newest versions of P-40's and P-39's. One of our captured P-39's was found to have mounted a 37mm cannon! Maintain your altitude to the extent possible, make the enemy climb to you. Recovery frequency is WPT 6.\n\nPlayer skin: vpmedia_A6M3.bmp\nMarkings: off\n
