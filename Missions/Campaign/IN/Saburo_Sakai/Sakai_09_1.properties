Name 15 Feb '42
Short A long range bomber escort mission in the Far East.\n
Description 15 Feb 1942 0530\n\n     This morning, a flight of Type 1 Bombers is going to the enemy airfield on a heavy bombing raid. You will be their escort. Fighter oppositon over enemy territory has been heavy, but with raids such as the one today, we will reduce their numbers and gain control of the air. If you see enemy bombers, you must resist the temptation to engage, as the safety of our bombers and the proposed results of the raid will far outweigh the victory over one or two enemy B-17s.  As always, if all air opposition is defeated, you have permission to strafe the airfield to maximize the effect of the raid, and to report its effecitveness.\n\nTake off and climbout to 1500m on the runway heading. Turn to heading 195 and climb to 3000m. Join with the bombers in sector AJ19 and continue on their navigation.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nMission Notes: Mind your fuel status. If you are leaking fuel you must immediately return to base. If you must ditch, Sub I-256 is on station in sector AJ13. Home airfield is 015 from target area. 360 from Port Dickson. Recovery frequency is WPT 6.\n
