Name 15 Feb 1945
Short Scramble intercept of strafing fighters.\n
Description 15 Feb 1945 0800\n\n     We are retreating on all fronts. The new Superfortresses are causing grave damage in many of the big cities. Most of our new Shiden fighters are down for lack of spare parts. Our fuel supply situation is not that much better. Of course, now that we are defending our own airfields, we don't need that much fuel anyway. The one bright spot, is how well our new special attack squadrons are doing against American carriers.\n     Destroying carrier attack planes must take priority, do not get caught up fighting with Hellcats. You must make these raids as costly as possible for the enemy so that we may turn our situation around.\n\nTake off and climb to 1500m. Turn to 090 and climb to 3500m. Turn to course 180 andfly to the southern edge of sector AO7. Turn to 265 and fly to AM6. If the air is clear of enemy aircraft, you may recover on a heading of  010 from sector AM6.\n\nGo!\n\nMission Notes: Cloudy, light winds. Focus your efforts against attack aircraft. Recovery frequency is WPT 6.\n\nPlayer skin: vp_A6M5_Saburo_Sakai.bmp\nMarkings: off\n\n     \n\n     \n
