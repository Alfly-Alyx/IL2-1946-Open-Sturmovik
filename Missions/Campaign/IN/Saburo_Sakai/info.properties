Name Saburo Sakai
Description An historical Campaign based on the missions and exploits of Japanese ace Saburo Sakai.\n\nThis Campaign is best played at the starting of rank of Chu-i or Tai-i. Starting at a lower rank will make it difficult to attain command as you progress.\n\nSome missions included in the campaign require flying on instruments. It is vital that you become familiar with reading the Altimiter, the Vertical Velocity (or climb and dive) indicator, and the radio direction finder. The needle in the radio direction finder tells you if you are to the left or right of your waypoint heading. If the needle is to the right of the dot, you must turn left to intercept your course.\n\nGood Luck!! And Thank You for choosing to download my campaign.\n\nB50
