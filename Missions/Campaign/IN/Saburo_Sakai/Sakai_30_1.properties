Name 4 Jul 1942
Short A fighter sweep in New Guinea.\n
Description 4 July 1942 0830\n\n     The month of June saw great victory for our forces theater wide. We continue to cause the enemy disastrous losses. Our available number of aircraft at any time has never exceeded 30 aircraft, though without the incessant night raids there undoubtedly would be more. It is because of your Samurai spirit that the war against this powerful enemy is going so well, and each pilot standing before me today shares in this victory.\n     Today's mission is a fighter sweep. We will patrol the area over the Owen Stanley range, and intercept all enemy aircraft approaching from Port Moresby.\n\nOn takeoff, climbout on the runway heading to an altitude of 1500m. Turn to heading 235 and climb to 4000m. When you reach sector AH18 you will turn to course 310 and proceed to sector AF19. If you have encountered no air opposition by this time, you are cleared to return to base on course 060 from sector AF19.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nMission Notes: Partly cloudy. Recovery frequency is WPT 6.\n\nPlayer skin: vpmedia_A6M3.bmp\nMarkings: off\n\n\n
