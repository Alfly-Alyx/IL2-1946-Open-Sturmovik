Name 7 May 1942
Short A recon sweep over the Port Moresby area\n
Description 7 May 1942 0630\n\n     Today's mission is a recon over Port Moresby. We will use this information to inflict the most damage possible over the coming days. The bomber force is preoccupied today. There has been increased enemy activity in the Solomon Sea, off of the eastern part of New Guinea. Therefore, with the expectation of light enemy air activity over Port Moresby, we will only need to send four Zeros. The rest will stay here at Lae to protect the airfields in the area.\n     The roster for today's flight is as follows: Sakai, Nishizawa, Ota and Takatsuka.\n\nAfter your climbout to 1500m, turn to 235 and climb to 5500m. Maintain this course until you reach sector AD15. Make your recon run on course 300 to sector AB16. At this time you may return on heading 065 from sector AB16.\n\nGood luck.\n\nMission Notes: Possible haze at low altitudes. Maintain your altitude to avoid AAA. Recovery frequency is WPT 6.\n
