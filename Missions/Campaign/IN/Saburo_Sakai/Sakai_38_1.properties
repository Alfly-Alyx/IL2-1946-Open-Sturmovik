Name 7 July 1944
Short Return to Japan.\n
Description 7 July 1944\n\n     (After failing to find the American ships you returned to Iwo. NAP 1/C Muto was the only other to return. There is no shame in this, as to crash into the sea would be a useless death. In the days following this last disastrous engagement, pilots and maintenance crews are evacuated from Iwo as they can be. Your flight arrives on the seventh.)\n\n     "The bomber cruised steadily towards Japan. But our worries were far from over. An hour and a half later we were in the middle of a violent rain storm. Sheets of water battered heavily at  the flying wreck. The plane leaked like sieve. The co-pilot returned again and asked me if I would come forward. The pilot was hardly any older-twenty two at the most.\n     "Sir? Should we try to go over the cloud deck or fly beneath it?"\n     "Take it below," I ordered.\n     "Beads of sweat dripped down his face. He was becoming panicky. In desperation he turned his pale face to me and bleated plaintively, "Sir, where are we now?"\n     "That was the silliest question I had ever heard from a pilot. For a few seconds I was speechless with astonishment. "Get out of that seat! I'm taking over!" I shouted."\n\n(From "Samurai!" by Saburo Sakai)\n\n     Your best estimate is that the nearest field is the Bansei bomber field, 150 NM on course 048.\n\n     \n
