Name 19 Feb '42
Short A large scale air battle in the FarEast.\n
Description 19 Feb 1942 0600\n\n      Yesterday, our recon aircraft returned with some disturbing news. The enemy is concentrating a large number of fighter aircraft at the Surabaya airfield to resist our liberation of the island of Java. Over 60 aircraft were seen on the ground at Surabaya. On any given day between our Tainan wing and the Kaohsiung wing nearby, we can only muster about 30 combat ready aircraft!\n     Today we will be coordinating with the Kaohsiung wing in a maximum effort raid against this airfield. The importance of this mission cannot be overstated. Our surface brothers will be in the area at the end of the month. We must own the skies!\n\nUpon reaching 1500m after takeoff, turn to heading 190 and proceed to sector AJ18 at 2500m. Form up with the Kaohsiung Zeros and continue on heading 190 at 4500m until reaching sector AH6. Turn 090 to AJ6. When you have neutralized the enemy air threat you are cleared to recover on heading 010 from AJ6.\n\nGood Luck, may you all return.\n\nMission Notes: Clear weather over target. Mind your fuel status. I-256 is on station in AK14 and the Destroyer Yukikaze is on station in AK12 if you cannot reach land on your return. Recovery frequency is WPT 7.\n\nPlayer skin: Graf_A6M2_Sakai_3-183.bmp\nMarkings: Off\n\n     \n
