Name A Combat air patrol over New Guinea
Short 11 Apr 1942\n
Description 11 Apr 1942 0800\n\n     This airbase at Lae with its lack of ammenities and poor facilities is only temporary. Just as we did in Java, the Tainan wing will provide air support for the Army and Naval surface forces that are in the area. Soon, after the Army liberates Port Moresby, we will move there. Now, we have work to do.\n     Today, your mission will be a familiarization flight over our new operations areas. You are forbidden from descending below 3000m over enemy territory. You will engage in air combat only. Bring back as much information about the defenses of the Moresby area as you can. The mountains here are not like anything that we have encountered so far. If your aircraft develops engine trouble at any time, return immediately.\n\nTake off and turn to a heading of 200, climb to 4000m. Over the radio beacon at AN18 you will turn to heading 250. Upon reaching sector AE14 your heading will be 300. AT this time you will take note of the status and complement of all airfields in the Port Moresby area. Once this is done, you may recover on heading 065 from sector AA17.\n\nGood Luck.\n\nMission Notes: Medium altitude scattered clouds. Possible heavy AAA. Possible fighters over target. Hard deck is 3000m. Do not go below 3000m at any time over enemy territory. Recovery frequency is WPT 6.\n
