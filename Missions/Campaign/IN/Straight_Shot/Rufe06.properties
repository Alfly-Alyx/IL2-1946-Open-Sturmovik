Description Rufe 6\n\nJune 5, 1943\nTime: 1638\nHomebase: Heavy Cruiser IJN Hashimoto\n\nWe have just received an urgent radio call from the army.  Even though you destroyed the bridge, the spy has escaped once again.  He was last seen heading for the coast.  \n\nFly down the same road one last time.  When the road splits after the last bridge, follow the road southeast to the coast looking for the truck.  If the truck makes it to the coast, the spy may have been forced to abandon it by now as we have alerted the AAA batteries to open fire on any trucks approaching the coast.  Look along the coast and in the small bays and rivers for boats as the spy may steal a boat to make his escape.  There are no authorized small ships or boats of any kind in the Collingwood Bay area.  If you see a ship or boat, you are under orders to sink it.  \n\nYour cannons will be quite effective on small boats.  Try not to hit the spy as the army wishes to interrogate him!\n\nNote: You will be airborne over the ship's catapult at 10m and 300kph as soon as the mission starts.\n\nPrimary Objective #1) Sink the boat being used by the coast watcher to escape (40 minute timeout)\nPrimary Objective #2) Land back at the ship and taxi to the starboard side (60 minute timeout)\n
