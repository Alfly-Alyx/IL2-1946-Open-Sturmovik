Description Rufe 1\n\nJune 3, 1943\nTime: 0755\nHomebase: Heavy Cruiser IJN Hashimoto\n\nOne of our submarines in the Coral Sea spotted several American C-47 cargo planes crossing the sea and then heading inland over the island in a north-easterly direction.  Their course suggested they were heading somewhere in the Oro Bay/ Collingwood Bay area.  They must be carrying spies and guerillas that will be dropped behind our lines!  Intercept the planes and shoot them down.  \n\nAfter takeoff head southwest toward Gabe (AV/20).  The enemy aircraft should be heading northeast directly towards you.  Keep flying southwest until you spot them.\n\nReturn to the Hashimoto after the intercept.  Land on the water and taxi to the ship's starboard crane for pickup.\n\nThe catapult is ready!  \n\nNote: You will be airborne over the ship's catapult at 10m and 300kph as soon as the mission starts.  Throttle up now!\n\nPrimary Objective #1) Shoot down at least one C-47 (10 minute timeout)\nPrimary Objective #2) Land back at the ship and taxi to the starboard side (60 minute timeout)\n
