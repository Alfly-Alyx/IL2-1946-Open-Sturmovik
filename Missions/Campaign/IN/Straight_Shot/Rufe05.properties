Description Rufe 5\n\nJune 5, 1943\nTime: 1553\nHomebase: Heavy Cruiser IJN Hashimoto\n\nGood job spotting the truck fleeing the bombardment.  the army has requested our help in capturing the spy.  You are to destroy the bridge in the center of sector AV/18.  Without the bridge, the spy will be trapped and the army will be able to capture him.  The bridge is the last one on the road before it turns west.  \n\nThe cruiser is refueling, so the catapult is unavailable.  You are being rearmed on the water.  The Hashimoto has sent out two of it's boats and you have been fitted with two 60kg bombs to destroy the bridge.  In addition, the safety pins have been removed from your guns so you now have full ammunition trays.  The armourer who failed to remove the pins prior to your last flight will be spending the next month in the brig!\n\nLet the boats pull away before you takeoff.  Once again, fly almost due south to the bridge.  Its about 20km from here.\n\nReturn to the Hashimoto after you destroy the bridge.  Land on the water and taxi to the ship's starboard crane for pickup.\n\nPrimary Objective #1) Destroy the bridge. (10 minute timeout)\nPrimary Objective #2) Land back at the ship and taxi to the starboard side (25 minute timeout)\n
