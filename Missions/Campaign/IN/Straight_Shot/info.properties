Name        Straight Shot - A Japanese Seaplane Campaign
Description You are a Rufe pilot assigned to the Heavy Cruiser IJN Hashimoto.  You will be catapulted off the cruiser to undertake nine intercept, recon and attack missions in your A6M2-N (Allied designation Rufe).\n\nYou need to select the highest rank available as you will need to command AI aircraft in one mission.  You may select whatever difficulty settings you want.  It may be helpful to play with Instant Success turned on in case you have difficulty completing a mission\n\nPlease be aware that you will see a 30% reduction in your score at the end of each mission as water landings, even for seaplanes, are regarded as crash landings.\n\nBrought to you by Zeus-cat with assistance from the Hell-Hounds VFW.  zeuscat@sbcglobal.net
