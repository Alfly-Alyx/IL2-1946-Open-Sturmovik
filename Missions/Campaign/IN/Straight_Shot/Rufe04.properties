Description Rufe 4\n\nJune 5, 1943\nTime: 1511\nHomebase: Heavy Cruiser IJN Hashimoto\n\nThe army found the vehicle that you destroyed, but they didn't find the coast watcher.  We have decided to bombard the area using the Hashimoto's guns to finish off this pest once and for all.\n\nFly almost due south to arrive over the coast watcher's hut.  Look for any signs of the coast watcher.  If you see nothing, climb to a safe altitude and act as an artillery spotter for the Hashimoto.\n\nMake a note of any activity you see in the area, especially on the road.  The army removed all the locals after they examined the coast watcher's hut, so there should be nothing moving down there.  \n\nReturn to the Hashimoto after the bombardment.  Land on the water and taxi to the ship's starboard crane for pickup.\n\nNote: You will be airborne over the ship's catapult at 10m and 300kph as soon as the mission starts.\n\nPrimary Objective #1) Arrive at the recon before the timeout. (3 minute timeout)\nPrimary Objective #2) Land back at the ship and taxi to the starboard side (20 minute timeout)\n
