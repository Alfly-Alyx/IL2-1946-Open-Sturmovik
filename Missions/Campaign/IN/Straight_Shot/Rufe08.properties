Description Rufe 8\n\nJune 6, 1943\nTime: 1851\nHomebase: Heavy Cruiser IJN Hashimoto\n\nWe suspect an enemy ship was sent to pick up the coast watcher.  Obviously, the Americans plan to use the darkness to sneak in, rescue their man and make their escape.  We must stop them.  Therefore, we are having you takeoff again and search for that ship.  You have been armed with two 60kg bombs to use against any small boats you encounter.  If the boat is too large for you to handle, there are four H8K1 flying boats being launched to assist you.  They each have two torpedoes for use against a larger ship. \n\nWe suspect the enemy ship wiill be somewhere in Collingwood Bay, near the location you sunk the landing craft.  Return to sector AZ/19 and search for the boat.  Work your way south along the coast if the enemy is not in AZ/19.  The H8K1's will join you over the bay.   \n\nSince it is getting dark, the cruiser has launched boats to act as a lighted runway upon your return.  Taxi to the ship's starboard crane for pickup.\n\nHidden Objective #1) Locate the enemy boat/ship (30 minute timeout)\nHidden Objective #2) Land back at the ship and taxi to the starboard side (60 minute timeout)\n
