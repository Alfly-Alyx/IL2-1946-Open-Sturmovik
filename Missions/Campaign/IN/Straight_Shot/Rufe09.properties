Name Rufe09
Short Rufe09\n
Description Rufe 9\n\nJune 7, 1943\nTime: 0733\nHomebase: Heavy Cruiser IJN Hashimoto\n\nOne of the seaplanes that sank the destroyer last night did not make it back to base.  The crew was forced to set down 20-30km west of Goodenough island because of AAA damage from the US destroyer.\n\nUnfortunately, the aircraft was damaged more severely than the crew realized and it sank overnight.  The surviving crew members only have two rafts to share and exposure is a serious threat to them by now.  \n\nTakeoff from the Hashimoto and fly due south to the island.  Fly another 10km inland and then turn west to start your search.  It is likely you will see debris or an oil slick from the downed aircraft if you are below 300m.  The crew will be nearby.\n\nOnce you locate the crew, land and offer any assistance they need.  You are to stay with the crew until a fishing boat can be sent to rescue them.  The boat will take the better part of the day to reach the crew so I hope you have no plans for the afternoon.\n\nNote: You will be airborne over the ship's catapult at 10m and 300kph as soon as the mission starts.\n\nHidden Objective #1) Locate the downed aircrew and land near them to provide assistance.  Do not return to the cruiser.  (60 minute timeout)\n
