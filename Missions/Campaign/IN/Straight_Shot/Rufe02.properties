Description Rufe 2\n\nJune 5, 1943\nTime: 0723\nHomebase: Heavy Cruiser IJN Hashimoto\n\nOnce again one of our submarines has picked up an American cargo plane heading inland.  We now suspect that the other planes were making a supply drop for a coast watcher.  Coast watchers spy on our ships and radio their movements to US naval command.  We have lost many ships in this areaWe have picked up radio transmissions from somewhere in the Gabe area so we suspect the coast watcher is in that area.  \n\nThe Gabe area is an excellent location for a coast watcher.  There are few people to spot him.  So as not to tip off the coast watcher that we know is in the area, the Hashimoto has moved further west and will stay here for the duration of your mission.\n\nAfter takeoff, head 150 degrees to the lake at AU/16.  Land on the southern half of the lake and wait for the C-47 to pass overhead.  It should be here in just a few minutes.  Takeoff and follow the C-47 to see where it drops it's cargo.  You should try to be within 2 kilometers of the cargo plane so that you can see the parachutes when it drops the cargo.  Make sure you note the exact position of this cargo drop.  You will be back here later today to destroy the coast watcher's postion.  \n\nAfter the cargo plane has dropped it's cargo you are free to destroy it.  \n\nReturn to the Hashimoto after the intercept.  Land on the water and taxi to the ship's starboard crane for pickup.\n\nThe catapult is ready!  \n\nNote: You will be airborne over the ship's catapult at 10m and 300kph as soon as the mission starts.\n\nPrimary Objective #1) Land on the lake at AU/16 (12 minute timeout)\nPrimary Objective #2) Shoot down the C-47 (50 minute timeout)\nPrimary Objective #3) Land back at the ship and taxi to the starboard side (60 minute timeout)\n
