They found their graves on sea.\n\n'Your' ship, the Hiryu, sunk. \nThe death filled his ranks.\n\nFor you, the death has got personality.\nWhen Sadao went down he left his radio open. \nHe didn't say anything. He didn't cry. \nHe breathed.\nYou heard how the the air was pressed out of his lungs. You heard the death pressing his chest together and you asked yourself if not the death himself opened his radio so that you can hear him at work.\nAnd suddenly, for a moment, you thought that you see him riding on Sadaos plane, pressing both hands into his cockpit, looking up to you, a dark smile on his black face.\nAhallucination.\nOf course.\nYour intellect knows it.\nBut why won't your feelings believe?\n\nNow, five days later you still haven't forget this morbid scene and you are astonished how real this picture still is. \n\n\nYou're sitting in your plane.
