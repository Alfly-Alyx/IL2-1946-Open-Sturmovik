The art of fighting an enemy with a fighter plane is the art of manouvering into a position to get an opportunity to shoot.\n\nThe coming chapter of your training is the most important one. It will show, if you're capable to become a fighter pilot.\nAre you the right man for the Zero?\n\nTraining the art of dogfight is the most difficult part of your training. It's very much like learning how to feel, very much like sharpening a sense.\nMany excellent pilots fail and sometimes only mediocre airmen shine in the face of the enemy.\n\nIt's impossible to say if somebody is a natural born fighter pilot unless this part of the training is completed.\n\nThere are many rules for many situations. But in the ened the airman's feel for dogfight has to be unveiled.\n\nWest of Omura Airfield one of our dogfight teachers is patrolling.\nFind him and try to get on his six.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n--------------------\nSearch your trainer's A6M at waypoint 4 and try to get on his six.\n\nTime: 13:30\nAltitude: 500m\nFlight: Omura- 5\n\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
