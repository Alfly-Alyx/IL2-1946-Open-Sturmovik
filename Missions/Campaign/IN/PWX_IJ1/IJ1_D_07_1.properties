Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nTarawa Atoll...... March 18th, 1942\n\n============================\n\nSITUATIONAL REPORT:\n\nAn enemy carrier was sighted!\n\nThe Americans attacked the Kaga Group two times yesterday. \nBoth attacks were conducted by planes from Tarawa. \nUntil now the enemy carrier had no chance for an attack. This will change today.\nAllthough the Kaga had to take some damage, the group is still fully operational.\nWith the exception of the sinking of one destroyer, the Americans weren't able to harm the operation at the loss of numerous dive- and torpedo bombers.\n\nAn air raid conducted from the Kaga against the enemy carrier group wasn't successful.\n\nAt that time the Hiryu arrived on the scene. \nJust at the right moment.\nIn the evening the Hiryu was attacked too.\nWithout success, fortunately.\n\n\nToday the distances will be shorter and the D3As will be able to reach the enemy.\n\nNow, after the night, the battle starts from scratch. The position of the enemy carrier can only be estimated.\nLong before sunrise, several reconaissance planes were send out to detect the American carrier.\nIt has to be taken into account that Tarawa could still have enough planes left for a second raid against us.\n\nThis situation brought the Admiral to the decision, to regroup the force:\n\nA Battleship Group was formed. It is ordered to steam toward the estimated position of the enemy's carrier group.\n\nThe Kaga Carrier Group was reinforced with the Hiryu and will follow the Battleship Group in some distance to enable the fighters to cover the battleships and itself.\n\nThe Landing Group is steaming behind. It will conduct the landing operation tomorrow morning.\n\nAt this moment it's clear that both sides will have to reconnoitre the position of the opponent's carrier group.\nThis is the time for forward fighter area control missions to interrupt the enemy's reconnaissance.\n\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nFighter Air Patrol over the Battleship Group.\n\nTime: 07:31\nAltitude:  5000m\nFlight: Toyo- Three\n\nWeather forecast:\nPartially overcast with stormy winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
