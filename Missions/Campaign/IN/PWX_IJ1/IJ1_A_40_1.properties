He will lead the second flight.\nMasao Hagiri and Takeo Odaka became the leaders of the third and fourth flights.\nSaji Yamamoto and Yukio Shida were assigned to lead the fifth and sixth flights.\n\nThen you decided to give your planes a camouflage pattern.\nFrom above the silver glancing Zeroes were too good to see. Perhaps the camouflage will help to save some lives.\n\nAlthough the time to rebuild your Kokutai was very short you haven't the worst feelings about it.\nThe young men are very well trained and this time they seem to be adulter compared to the wild boys you got last time.\n\nThis evening you go back aboard a carrier.\nThe Akagi is passing Kita No Shima in the north.\nThe 13th is assigned to it.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nFly to the Akagi and land on it.\n\nTime: 18:10\nAltitude: 500m\nFlight: Yuri- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear late afternoon.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
