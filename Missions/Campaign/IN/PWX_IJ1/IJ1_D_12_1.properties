March 19th, 1942\n\n===========================\n\nSITUATIONAL REPORT:\n\nThe Kaga sunk!\n\nThousands of men are dead.\nA heavy loss.\n\nFor two hours the whole operation was questionable.\nBut in the end the leading Admiral didn't want to leave the battlefield without taking Tarawa.\n\nThe air raid against the Kaga came from the atoll and the majority of the planes were planes from the American carrier. So it could be that the American carrier sunk too.\nEverybody hopes so.\n\nIf that's true, then Tarawa could still be invaded.\nSo it was decided to let the planned operation go on.\n\nIn these minutes the assault on Betio Island is starting.\nA couple of medium AA guns are defending the Island against our landing fleet.\nYour flight is ordered to attack these guns.\n\nIn the evening we will know if this decision was the right one.\n\n\nMission orders:\n----------------------\nAttack the AA guns with bombs and guns.\n\nTime: 10:36\nAltitude:  1000m\nFlight: Toyo- Two\n\nWeather forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
