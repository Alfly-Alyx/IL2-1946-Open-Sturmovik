Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nMarianas Islands,\nGuam.\n\nDecember 28th, 1941\n\n==============================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nYou've seen the real war.\n\nFor you it was short.\nNot more than about two days of fighting.\nBut nonetheless this short time gave you a real picture of what's happening when men slash at each other with the will to kill.\n\nYou survived.\nMore than 65 percent of the Hiryu's airmen did not.\nThe same with the Akagi. And with the Americans.\n\nOther than at the battle of Pearl Harbor the Americans at Wake were prepared and showed a stiff resistance.\nThis time it wasn't an easy victory.\n\nWake is Japanese. And seen from the eyes of any head command officer the losses were low compared to what was won.\n\nBut you're looking through your eyes.\nAnd that what you saw was rarely a good price for what was won.\nYou saw how short a carrier airman's life can be if he has to encounter an opponent who doesn't want to give up in the first minutes.\n\nYour comrades, especially those who fought at Pearl Harbor are somewhat depressed. All were shocked by the high losses at Wake.\n\nThis war has just begun.\nHow will it go on? Pearl Harbor Style or Wake Style?\nOr will it be different...... more worse?\n\nIn the morning the group reached the Marianas.\nBefore the carriers enter Port Apra, the air groups have to transfer to Apra Airbase.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n--------------------\nLand at Apra Airbase.\n\nTime: 07:45\nAltitude: 500m\nFlight: Aomori- Three\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
