Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nBetio Island Airfield, Tarawa Atoll...... \n\nJune 4th, 1943\n\n==================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe enemy carrier Saratoga is burning!\n\nAlthough still on the surface, the ship is heavyly destroyed.\nFrom northwest the Taiho Group is closing and has just passed Tarawa in the north.\n\nIn this minute we got the message that a third American carrier was sighted northeast of us.\nThe Taiho is just prepairing an air raid against it.\n\nIf we can sink it, this would become an even greater victory than at Pearl Harbor.\nBut this morning cost many lives and planes.\n\nFrom the formerly 32 planes of your 13th Kokutai only 16 are still operational.\nYou're glad that Zenjiro Imari came with eight of his planes just at the right moment to counter the last enemy attack. He lost two planes on that occasion and now is filling up the Hiryu's Fighter Group to meager twenty planes.\n\nSix planes are up to secure the ship group. You're standing on deck, ready for a quick take off with eight machines.\n\nSuddenly:\n\nAlert!\n\nEnemy planes incoming!\n\nIf the Hiryu  will be damaged, land on the Taiho, which is closing from the northwest.\n\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nScramble!\n\nTime: 11:50\nAltitude:  1000m\nFlight: Aomori- One\n\nWeather forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
