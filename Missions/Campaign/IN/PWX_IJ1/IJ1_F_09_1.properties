Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++  CLASSIFIED ++++++++++++++\n\nMidway Islands / Kure Atoll\n\nJune 6th, 1942\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nSITUATION:\n\nAn American Carrier Group is in the area!\n\nThe Shokaku Group was attacked two times until now:\n\nThe first raid reached it at 6 o'clock. None of the Group's ships were hit by the B-25s and SBDs.\nThe second raid at about 07:30 succeeded in sinking the Shoho Light Carrier with TBFs and SBDs. \nBoth attacks came from Midway.\n\nThirty minutes ago one of our reconnaissance planes has detected an American Carrier Group  north of Midway, east from us.\n\nUntil now, only the Shokaku Group was detected by the enemy. We estimate that Hiryu Group and the Akagi Group are still undetected by the enemy.\n\nWe got the order by Admiral Nagumo to attack the enemy carrier group immediately.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nEscort the torpedo- and dive- bombers to the enemy group and back.\n\n\nTime: 09:35\nAltitude: 3000m\nFlight: Kobe- Three\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
