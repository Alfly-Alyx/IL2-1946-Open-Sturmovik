But both seems to be still operational.\nOne of our battleships was damaged seriously, the other one was damaged only slightly. The fairly intact one was assigned to the carrier group, the other one is steaming home, guided by four destroyers.\n\nSince the morning the two enemy battleships weren't seen again. The last reports told that both were heavyly damaged but there are no reports telling that one or both were sunk.\n\nWe have lost many planes.\nFrom the 32 fighters of your squadron only eighteen are operational. For the dive and torpedo bombers squadrons the situation is even worse:\nOnly nine B5Ns and thirteene D3As are left. \nWe don't know the exact losses of the enemy air group but it can be estimated that the situation isn't better.\n\nThese planes shall be used for a last attempt to sink the enemy carrier.\nAt the moment, a strongly escorted reconaissance mission is underway. \n\nSince four hours the enemy didn't make another attempt to attack us.\nSuddenly you were called to the flight deck...\n\nA small group of enemy planes is incoming.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nScramble to intercept the enemy planes.\n\nTime: 16:24\nAltitude: 2500m\nFlight: Yuri- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
