Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nPacific Ocean\n800 miles southwest of Hawaii\n\nFebruary 11th, 1943\n\n=================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThree days have passed since the carrier battle on the 8th.\nAll in all, the outcome of the battle must be described as a draw.\n\nA horrible draw for the air groups of both carriers.\n\nIf the Americans, like us, had sent their last remaining planes into the attack at the 8th' evening, then the battle ate the great majority of the air group's airmen and material.\n\nAlthough both carriers were hit, partially badly, the ships survived the battle. Not so the air groups.\n\nIt seems that the fact, that the first attacks went against well defended battleships the losses of both side's bomber forces were so serious that the final and decisive raids against the carriers didn't succeed.\n\nOnly one day of intense battle cost your squadron 22 planes lost, five planes damaged and 20 pilots dead or missing, and 5 wounded. The dive- and torpedo bomber units have lost nearly all they had before.\n\nThe carrier group is on the way back to Japan.\nYou're one of the few lucky, to see your homeland again.\nWill it be for the last time?\n\n\nMission Orders:\n--------------------\nCombat Air Patrol forward the carrier group.\n\nTime: 17:45\nAltitude: 3000ft\nFlight: Yuri- One.\n\nWeather Forecast:\nStrong winds, satisfying visibility.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n
