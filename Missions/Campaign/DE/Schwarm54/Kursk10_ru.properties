Description I./JG54\n==============\nDate: 28 July 1943\n------------------------\nTime: 1910\n------------------------\nWeather: Poor\n==============\n\nCitadel ends miserably in death and mud.  You have one last task in this operation - to patrol the evacuation routes west of Orel.  Ivan has his tail up now, and will surely punish those who lag behind.\n\nFollow the patrol route and intercept the enemy assault aircraft.  Soon we will deploy elsewhere, away from this gloomy and rain-sodden country.\n\n------------------------\nOrd.: N/A\n------------------------\n
