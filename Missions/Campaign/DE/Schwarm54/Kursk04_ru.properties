Description I./JG54\n==============\nDate: 6 July 1943\n------------------------\nTime: 1020\n------------------------\nWeather: Overcast\n==============\n\nOur offensive has stalled on a line west of Ponyri.  The contribution of Luftflotte 6 now becomes decisive.  You will attack Soviet defensive positions on the outskirts of Ponyri, using precision rockets.\n\nThis is a crucial moment.  You will strike the target come what may.  Do not allow yourself to become embroiled in the air battle until your ordnance has been expended.\n\n------------------------\nOrd.: 2 x Wfr.Gr.21\n------------------------\n
