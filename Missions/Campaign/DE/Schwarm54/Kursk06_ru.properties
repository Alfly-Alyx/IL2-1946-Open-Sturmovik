Description I./JG54\n==============\nDate: 8 July 1943\n------------------------\nTime: 1640\n------------------------\nWeather: Hazy\n==============\n\nOur 9th Army still fights bitterly to wrest Ponyri from the Russians.  Ivan is pouring in his reserves to halt our momentum, but he will not be able to resist forever.\n\nEnemy air strength is also increasing.  Their pathetic performance over the first few days has been followed by a renewed determination.  The skies over the battlefield become more dangerous by the hour.\n\nNevertheless, that is no obstacle to the work of the Jaboschwarm.  We will strike artillery positions at Ponyri with anti-personnel weapons.  Our brave lads on the ground will cheers us as we pass.\n\n------------------------\nOrd.: 1 x AB500\n------------------------\n
