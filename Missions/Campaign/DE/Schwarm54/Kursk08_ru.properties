Description I./JG54\n==============\nDate:10 July 1943\n------------------------\nTime: 0455\n------------------------\nWeather: Good\n==============\n\nThe central spearhead of our offensive continues to move south to Olkhovatka.  Our progress is slowing on this side of the salient, but at least our southern thrust in the Voronezh sector still makes good ground.  As long as we can maintain the pressure on this front, we may yet succeed.\n\nTo this end, you will strike Olkhovatka ahead of this morning's attack.  Hit the defences around this village.  Ivan cannot hold his entire perimeter indefinitely - at some stage the dam will burst and we will be through!\n\n------------------------\nOrd.: 1 x SC500\n------------------------\n
