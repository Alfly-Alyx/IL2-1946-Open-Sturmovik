Description I./JG54\n==============\nDate: 19 July 1943\n------------------------\nTime: 1135\n------------------------\nWeather: Poor\n==============\n\nThe Soviets have launched a counter-offensive from the east, in the direction of Orel.  It looks as though our focus on the Kursk salient has allowed Ivan to steal a march on us.  We are in a position of great danger.\n\nThe VVS have also greatly increased their activities.  Large bombing raids are now almost an hourly occurrence.  Frontline observers are reporting another raid coming in from south of Tagino.  Scramble immediately and attempt to intercept.  You will use the rockets fitted for this morning's operations in the air-to-air role.\n\n------------------------\nOrd.: 2 x Wfr.Gr.21\n------------------------\n
