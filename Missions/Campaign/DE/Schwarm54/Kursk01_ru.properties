Description I./JG54\n==============\nDate: 2 July 1943\n------------------------\nTime: 1330\n------------------------\nWeather: Poor\n==============\n\nWelcome to the Jaboschwarm!  Soon you will taste the smoke of battle like a true Jabo pilot, but first we must take on the normal duties of the Staffel.  KG3 have had their normal escort cancelled, so we shall take their place.  We will follow them to the city of Kursk, and ensure that Ivan gives them no bother.\n\nDo not hunt for the glory of kills.  Our first duty is to ensure those bombs fall on their target.\n\n------------------------\nOrd.:  N/A\n------------------------\n\n\n\n\n\n
