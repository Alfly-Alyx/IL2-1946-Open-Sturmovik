Description I./JG54\n==============\nDate: 5 July 1943\n------------------------\nTime: 0755\n------------------------\nWeather: Poor\n==============\n\nCitadel begins!  Our spearheads have attacked between Trosna and Maloarchangelsk.  The delays to the start of the operation have allowed the Reds to strengthen their defences.  Nevertheless, the weight and force of our attack, combined with our new superior armour, is bound to be decisive.\n\nYou will attack enemy panzers in the Tagino sector, on the western axis of our assault.  Once you have dropped your bombs, loiter over the battlefield and look for targets of opportunity.  Reports inform us that enemy attack aircraft are also thick in the air - do not engage them unless you are sure their escorts have been dealt with first.\n\n------------------------\nOrd.: 1 x SC500\n------------------------\n
