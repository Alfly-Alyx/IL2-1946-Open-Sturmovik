Name JF17
Short \n
Description 15 September 1940\n\nThis morning we are again escorting the bombers to London. Due to the increasing number of our bomber losses, however, the Reichsmarschall has decreed that the Jagdwaffe must from now on provide only close escort, losing us the advantage of height, speed and surprise. The RAF also seem to have changed their tactic from intercepting at squadron strength, now to attacking in wing strength. Our best hope is to break up their formations before they can get to the bombers. Good luck!\n
