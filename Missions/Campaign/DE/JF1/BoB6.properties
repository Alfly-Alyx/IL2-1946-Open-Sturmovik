Name JF16
Description 9 September 1940\n\nAfter the RAF's night bombing of Berlin, Hitler has ordered that our bombers are to turn their attention on London and raise it to the ground! Beware, however, as due to the fact we are extending our range somewhat, we will only have fuel for limited combat time... unless you want to be swimming home that is!\n\nToday we are escorting the Ju88's of KG26 as they attack east London's docks.\n
