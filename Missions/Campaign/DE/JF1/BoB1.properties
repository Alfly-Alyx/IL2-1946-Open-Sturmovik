Name JF11
Description 5 August 1940\n\nHaving been redesignated I/JG54, after seeing little action over the Pas de Calais, or during our recent posting back in Holland, we are now ready to fight as a unified Geschwader!\n\nNow subordinated to Jafu 2, we have been transferred back to the Pas de Calais area as the Luftwaffe builds strength for an all out aerial offensive against southern England. From here we will be flying Freie Jagd missions and escort for our bombers attacking the RAF's airfields.\n\nToday we will be flying a staffel strength Freie Jagd mission across the Kent coastline. Despite a decrease in the intensity of the air fighting in recent days, the RAF still pose a significant threat. Don't forget, stay close to your Rottenfuhrer... and good hunting!\n
