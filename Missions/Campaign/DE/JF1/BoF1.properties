Short Congratulations Feldwebel! You have completed your flight training and are now a fully fledged member of the Jagdwaffe.\n\n22 November 1939\n\nAs the Phoney War with the French and British continues, you are assigned to I/JG76 operating out of Frankfurt Rhein-Mein civil airport, where for the next few months you will be flying wingman on patrols over the Ardennes region. Our pilots have already been involved in skirmishes with French Morane and Curtiss fighters, and intelligence suggests the RAF and the Belgian Air Force are also operating in this sector, although these have not yet been encountered.\n\nYour first mission as a Jagdflieger will be today's patrol along the Franco-Belgian border. Good Luck and stay close to your Rottenfuhrer!\n
