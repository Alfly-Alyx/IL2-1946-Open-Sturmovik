Name Save the Kriegsmarine
Short Fly an intercept against Beaufighter torpedo planes and their Spitfire escort and save a stranded Torpedo Ship.\n
Description Herr Leutnant, one of the Kriegsmarine's torpedo ships was out on maneuvres last night and suffered an engine malfunction. Finally - just before dawn - the crew got the motor running again. The difficulty is that the ship is now out at sea in broad daylight. It's only a matter of time before Tommy sends aircraft to sink her.\n\nTake your flight and second flight and fly a CAP over the ship. Shoot down any Tommy attack planes you spot. Fly at 1600 meters at vector 273.\n\nGood luck, Herr Leutnant.\n
