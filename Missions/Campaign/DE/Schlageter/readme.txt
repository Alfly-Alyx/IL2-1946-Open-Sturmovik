Schlageter '43 is a 12 mission semi-historical campaign set in Northern France in the time period May-August 1943. Inspired by Donald L. Caldwell's "JG26: Top Guns of the Luftwaffe", the campaign features the FW190A-5. You will fly as a flight leader among the other "Old Hares" of JG26 "Schlageter". The missions feature dogfights with Spitfire IXC's and early P-47D's and intercepts of Beaufighter torpedo strike planes, Mosquito light bombers and PRU planes, B-17 high altitude heavy bombers and RAF B-25C medium bombers. You will also fly intruder strikes over Allied air bases and nautical targets. 7 of the missions primarily feature RAF opposition and 5 feature encounters with the fledgling 8th USAAF.

Normandy substitutes for the Pas de Calais/ Western Belgium area. Missions are reasonably balanced to allow for a good chance of success. Choose highest available rank to commence campaign.

Do you have what it takes to fly with the "Yellow Nosed Abbeville Bastards"?

I hope to re-release most of these missions configured to be red-flyable for the Spitfire IXC in the next few weeks as a "book-end" campaign.
