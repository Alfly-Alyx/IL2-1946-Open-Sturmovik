Description Herr Leutnant, the generals are convinced that something special is happening in England - perhaps even Herr Churchill's famous "invasion". So today, Luftflotte command is sending a series of recconaissance flights over the Allied bases on the English south coast to try and ascertain what exactly is happening there.\n\nKongratulieren, Herr Leutnant. You will be flying escort on one such flight. Take your Schwarn and 3rd Schwarm and fly at between 6500 and 7000 meters.\n\nBe alert for heavy flak and Ami and Tommy fighter patrols. Don't fall asleep up there.\n
