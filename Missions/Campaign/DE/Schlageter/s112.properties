Name JaBo strike on a US submarine.
Short Fly a low level JaBo sweep on a stranded Allied submarine.\n
Description Herr Leutnant, one of our Kondor aircraft has located an Allied U-Boot several miles offshore in the channel. The U-Boot appears unable to submerge.\n\nDer Priller wishes you to take your flight and destroy that U-Boot. 3rd flight will fly cover. Fly to contact at 2000 meters and glide bomb at 400 meters.\n\nThe Allies will likely send other Naval and air units to protect the U-Boot. Be prepared to do a little fighting.\n\nBy the way, Herr Leutnant, we have received orders transferring you to an instructional unit back in the Heimat, effective immediately. As a result, this will be your last mission with Schlageter. Der Pips will be hosting a small get-together for yourself and the other pilots upon your return.\n\nSo try a little harder to stay alive today. Der Alte always brings out the the best champagne and cigars for these parties!\n
