Short Attack a battered formation of B-17's returning from Germany.\n
Description Herr Leutnant, we have a location on that B-17 raid for you. Fly at vector 002 at 6800 meters altitude. The bomber formation has fragmented under the pressure of our earlier fighter strikes. We have spotted an element of about squadron strength with some stragglers and a small fighter escort. They are flying northwest.\n\nAttack the B-17's and shoot down as many as you can.\n
