Name Willkommen in Kanalfront!
Short The RAF gives you a "warm welcome" on your first evening in France.\n
Description Gute Abend, Herr Leutnant. It is understood that you have a lot of experience on the Ostfront. But here on the Kanalfront, things are very different. We often fly at altitudes very much higher than in the East. So you will have to learn to use and get comfortable with oxygen equipment. As well, you will have to fly very tight formations. Far tighter than the loose flying you did in the East.\n\nDon't worry, der Priller will make very, very sure you learn all our tactics. And you don't want to make der Pips angry, I assure you. He may be small in size, but he can be a very large presence in your life.\n\nThe Tommies are far better trained than the Ivans and their pilots are more experienced in high level surprise tactics. So you must stay alert up there. And the Amis are flying in significant numbers now too. They use a very large radial-engined fighter called the "Thunderbolt". It's fast and very good up high. Not so maneuverable however at low level.\n\nOn the other hand, Herr Leutnant, we eat far better in the West than on the Ostfront. And der Galland makes sure we always get the best fighters and lots of good cigars! So it's not all hard work!\n\nEin moment, bitte! We have reports of a low level Tommy raid coming directly for us. Get out to your assigned aircraft and get ready for take off.\n\nWillkommen in Kanalfront!\n
