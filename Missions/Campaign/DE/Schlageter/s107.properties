Name Willkommen in Krieg, Amis!
Short Dawn Raid on an American base in "England".\n
Description Herr Leutnant, this morning we are going to surprise our American friends. Ja, the Americans are good pilots. Some of them. And they are not the mongrel Chicago gangsters Herr Goebbels always talks about. But maybe they don't completely appreciate what the Luftwaffe can do when it has to. Nein?\n\nSo at dawn today, we are going to attack the American base and - as they say in the USA - "bomb hell out of it".\n\nCruise towards target at 1200 meters and glide bomb at 350 meters.\n\nViel Glueck!\n
