Now that Seelow has finally yielded, we must prevent the Soviets taking advantage of any confustion that arises as we reorganise our front.\n\nThe F\u00FChrer reminds us that all is not lost.

The final act has begun - it is a moment that Ivan will come to regret.\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\nWeapons upgraded to U3 standard.\n\n0635 20 April 1945\n\n\n
