Description The Ju 88 can operate day-and-night in all weather conditions - all but the most extreme, anyway.  This mission is a short one, which demonstrates a possible instrument approach procedure, used to get you down in safety on a bad night.\n\nAs you only have one WP after the airstart, your ac 'pointer' will keep pointing at this WP throughout the mission.  In effect you have 'tuned' your direction finder to a radio beacon at this point.  The beacon is at Bad Day and we'll call it the 'BD' or 'Berta-Dora' in the German phonetic alphabet.  The BD is on the extended runway centreline.\n\nDue to the large mountains in this area it is important to know where you are and how high to fly in order to stay safe at all times.\n\nYou start at 3000 m about 3 mins from the BD.  You've come from the flat ground to the north, so you know you're safe at this height, so long as you remain somewhere north of the BD.\n\n1. Fly to the BD at 3000 m at a speed of 300 kph.\n\nWhen the beacon 'topples' you know you're exactly over the BD.  As you only get bearing from the beacon and not distance, this is the only time you will know precisely where you are: when distance = 0.\n\n2. From ontop the BD turn left onto 315 for 1 minute and descend to 2100 m.  After 1 minute turn left again back to the BD, ideally heading 135 - the runway centreline.  Bring the speed back to around 220 kph and drop gear and some flap.\n\nThe BD is on the centreline at ~9 km, so if we fly over it heading 135 for 2:10 min:sec we should end up at the threshold to runway 14.\n\n3.  From ontop the BD for the second time start a stopwatch and begin a gentle descent (~3 m/s) heading 135.  Target altitudes based on time after the BD are as follows:\n\n- 0:00 - 2100 m\n- 1:00 - 1920 m\n- 2:00 - 1750 m**\n\n**DO NOT DESCEND BELOW THIS ALTITUDE UNLESS VISUAL WITH THE RUNWAY OR APPROACH LIGHTING\n\nAs you carry out the approach the tail of the 'ac' on the compass should point to 135 if you're on track; if it is left or right of 135 then you are left/right respectively and need to correct.  Check on the Direction Indicator that the top scale reads 315.\n\nIf nothing seen at 2:10 carry out the Missed Approach Procedure (MAP).\n\n4. MAP: Climb ahead to 3000 m, on passing 2000 m start a left turn direct to the BD.  From the BD head 270 for 1 min, then turn right back to the BD and repeat the approach from 1.\n\nVadimkino elevation 1660 m.\n\nSortie profile for training purposes:\n\n - overshoot from the first approach regardless of what you see, and carry out the MAP.\n\n- when you see the lights on the next attempt drop landing flap and land.\n\nWeather Rain, poor viz, cloud 6/8 1400 m, wind 180/40-50 kph.
