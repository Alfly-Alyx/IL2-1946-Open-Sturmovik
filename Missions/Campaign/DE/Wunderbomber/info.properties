Name Wunderbomber
Short Training campaign for Ju 88\n
Description Campaign for Ju 88 pilot.  Covers various methods of attack, weapons, formation flying and leading.  Missions progress in technical difficulty and are set within historic frameworks from various periods of the war, although not in chronological order.\n\nStart in highest rank.\n\nDifficulty:\n- turn off 'no instant success'\n- to maximize learning, I would recommend making full use of externals and no cockpit as 'debriefing' tools to see:\n-- where bombs really went\n-- actual speed, height at weapon release\n\n\n
