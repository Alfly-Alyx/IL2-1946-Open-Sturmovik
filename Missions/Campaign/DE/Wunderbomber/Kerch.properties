Description This mission is a fairly short consolidation exercise, where you use cloud cover again to interdict Soviet supply lines.  Supplies are brought into Kerch by ship and then moved forward by rail as far as Lenino, AW11-east.  From there supplies have to be moved by road.\n\nMake a dawn sweep of the sea around the Taman peninsula; we expect an enemy cargo ship in that area.  Your navigator should guide you to the right area.  Locate the merchant ship and make a dive-bomb attack.  Today's loadout is 2 x SC-250 plus 28 x SC-50.  The first bombs dropped will be the external SC-250s.  Once these have been dropped on the ship you will be left with a decent length stick of small bombs carried internally.\n\nUse these bombs to make a low attack on the wooden road bridge in AV10-northeast.  The bridge runs east-west.  Aiming to drop the stick at an acute angle across the bridge gives the best chance of success.  Start dropping early, as the stick covers a good distance and there's no point in running the risk of the first bombs going slightly long.\n\nVisibility is expected to be poor and you will be coming - roughly - out of the rising sun, so with a bit of luck you will surprise any defences at the bridge.  The lowest setting on the bombsight is 500 m, so try an attack from that height.  Although the visibility is poor your navigator should guide you to the right area.  As you approach the target you can use the river on your left and the road on the right to 'funnel' you into the target.  After all, the bridge, by definition, must be where the two meet.\n\nAs you are alone you can cruise as fast as you like - 100% prop speed and 90% throttle will not overheat even with rad closed.\n\nLand at the Romanian Stuka base, AS10-southeast, by 0635.  If you haven't lost an engine to flak, you might want to get ready for the time when you do come home on one engine.  You could shutdown one engine and feather the prop, if you're feeling confident, but you may prefer to keep the engine running and just simulate the loss of the engine by closing the throttle, and reduce prop speed to 0% to reduce drag and simulate a feathered prop.  If you keep the 'dead' engine running you can bring it up again if it all starts to look a bit difficult.  If you have time try an overshoot on one engine, but apply power to the live engine carefully or you could spin into the ground.  You may always start with two engines, but being able to fly on just one is something the Luftwaffe expects of its multi-engine pilots.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTES\n\nKG 3, based at Tiraspol in Moldavia, was probably the closest Ju 88 unit to the Crimea in the spring of '44 when the Soviets forced their way back into the Crimea.  It would have taken about an hour-and-a-half to reach the Kerch area from Tiraspol, so is well within Ju 88 range.\n
