Description KG 26 was a torpedo-bomber unit, which had operated the He 111 in that role until III Gruppe converted to the Ju 88 in late 42.  After operating against the Arctic convoys earlier in 42 they moved to sunnier climes - no doubt to the relief of the crews - as the arctic summer drew to a close.  Now based at Grosseto in Italy KG 26 is still in the anti-shipping role.  As you'll need AAA's mods to get a Ju 88 with torpedoes, I'll assume III Gruppe trained at dive-bombing, despite their previous role - although it might seem unlikely.  Nevertheless, co-ordinating dive- and torpedo-bombers could be very effective, so it might have made sense for KG 26 to make use of the 88's dive-bombing ability alongside their 111 torpedo-bombers, and that is the assumption behind this mission.\n\nSometime in late '42 / early '43, with the situation in North Africa looking bleak.  The Allies are running a convoy through to Malta from the east.  Part of the covering force for this operation consists of a carrier group and KG 26 has been given the job of sinking the carrier.  Without the carrier's air cover the convoy may well be forced to turn back.\n\nIdeally you should attack just before the more vulnerable torpedo-bombers make their attack, so as to draw some of the flak away from them.  The commander of the 111 Staffel is planning to lead his force so as to make an attack from the landward side of the carrier force.  Shadow his movements and aim to go into your dive as the 111s start to run in.  Fly to each waypoint, then you should see your Staffel fall into line-astern, ready for the attack, as you fly along the coast.  They will now attack the carrier without need for further orders, although it will help if you can approach the target from astern.  DON'T order 'Attack Ships' or they will pick random ships to attack.  Consider descending to 2-3 km before going into your final dive; use the speed gained to get through the flak quickly; use the nose-down attitude to keep the target in sight as you line up.  \n\nIf you survive the attack, make your way to the airfield in B5, via the navigational beacon on the tip of the island if necessary.  Down a well-deserved drink when you get there!\n\nSkin: Ju88A4_mediteran_early.bmp\n
