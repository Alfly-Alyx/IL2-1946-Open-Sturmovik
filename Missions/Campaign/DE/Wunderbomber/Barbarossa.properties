Description That last mission was quite a long one and - perhaps you'll be pleased to hear - was the last night mission.  This mission will be shorter and contains more action.\n\nPerhaps the most difficult position to fly is the leader of an element within a larger formation.  You have to act as leader to your followers, while being a follower at the same time.  It's time for you to have a go at leading an element within a larger formation.\n\nThe mission airstarts as you cross the frontier, just south of Lesko.  You're cruising at 1000 m at 340 kph and your 3-ship Vee is on the left of the Staffelkapitan's Vee.  Hold position so that the 9-ship, Staffel, formation is a Vee of 3-ship Vees.  As you are sat on the left of the cockpit, you'll find it easier to keep sight of the leader if you fly slightly lower than him.  The leader of the Kette on the right will have a better view of the Staffelkapitan to his left, so can fly a little higher and still be visual.  This reduces the risk of collisions and also gives the formation's gunners overlapping fields of fire if the Ketten keep tightly closed up.\n\nAt WP2 the Staffelkapitan will commence a descent to about 100 m agl.  From WP3, Dublyanyi, you are running into the target.  Your Kette, being on the left, is allocated the left-hand concrete pan as its target.  Dublyanyi to target is 30 km and, if you check the TAS-meter in front of the bomb-aimer, you'll see you are doing 360 kph TAS or 6 km/min.  Start a stopwatch to give yourself a countdown to the target - 5 mins.\n\nSet 0 s delay on the AB-500s - they'll still drop a fair way before dispensing bomblets.  From a height of 100 m at around 350 kph IAS, setting 75 degrees on the Lofte bombsight will give a good idea of the mean point of impact.  Don't use automation; just drop when the crosshairs are over the target.  Target elevation is 150 m; you need to fly at an altitude of 250 m.  \n\nYour wingmen can not be made to bomb the target from low level without flying themselves into the ground, unless you fly the bomb-run on autopilot - and what's the point of that?  The other AI seem to manage perfectly well.  Just accept that you'll have to do as much damage as you can with no help from your wingmen.\n\nPost-target, continue ahead and rejoin by WP5.  Hold your position until back in friendly territory, when you can end the mission.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTES\n\nThe Luftwaffe employed SD-2 bomblets for the first time on the opening day of Barbarossa.  Scattered from low level over Soviet airfields they proved to be very effective.  At the time they were dropped directly from the bomb bay, but this method was found to carry risks for the bomber when KG 51 lost 15 Ju 88s to acidents with SD-2s: almost half the Luftwaffe's total losses on the opening day of Barbarossa.  The weapon was withdrawn, to reappear later carried in the canisters which we get in the game, and which I, therefore, had to use in this mission.\n\nKG 51 sent 18 Ju 88s to a bomber base at Stryi on 22 June.  The bombers then went on to attack a second, fighter, airfield at Lemberg (Lvov).  They saw some I-15s and I-16s, but outdistanced them.  The concrete airfield at Shyretsz will serve as the bomber airfield for this mission and will be the only target, as the AI will drop all bombs on the first target.  \n
