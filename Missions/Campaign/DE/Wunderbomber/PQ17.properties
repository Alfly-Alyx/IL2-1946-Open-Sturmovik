Description Hopefully you managed to achieve something last time out, despite the lack of co-operation from your wingmen.  They might to be more useful this time, although their accuracy is never great against moving targets, even at high skill settings.\n\nYou have a full Staffel under your command tonight.  I know I said you'd done your last night mission, but this hardly counts as 'night' due to the midnight sun of midsummer at high latitudes.\n\nSearch for scattered enemy ships in the Barents Sea.\n\nIf you briefly engage autopilot after the airstart the other 2 Ketten will form-up either side of your Kette and follow you wherever you go.  Lead them in the search for enemy ships; order them to attack, as desired; then when you've dropped all your bombs make your way home.  Your navigator will guide you through a search of the target area - follow your in-cockpit WP indicators.  \n\nYou will have to be almost overhead any ships you find before the AI will obey an order to 'attack ships'.  You have a pair of SC-250 bombs and a stick of 10 SC-50s.  The long stick increases the chance of the AI hitting with at least some bombs.  You could try to drop your stick of 50-kgs bombs from level flight, after dive-bombing your SC-250s.\n\nUse external views to help search - after all, you have 9x4 pairs of eyes looking in all directions from your formation, so it isn't really unrealistic.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTES\n\nDespite Royal Navy warnings that little could be done to protect the Arctic Convoys at the time if the Germans attacked in force with surface ships, U-boats and aircraft in concert, the Western Leaders overruled them and sent convoy PQ17 to Russia in the summer of 1942 carrying $ 700-million-worth of war materiel in 34 ships.\n\nWhen it looked like Tirpitz had put to sea the order to scatter the convoy was given - from London, not by the commanders on the spot.  In fact, Tirpitz was just changing her mooring, but the damage had been done.  The virtually defenceless merchantmen were hunted down by U-boats and aircraft, which sent 23 to the bottom, along with over 3000 motor vehicles, 430 tanks, 210 crated aircraft and almost 100 000 tons of general freight including radar sets and ammunition.\n\nKG 30 took the Ju 88 to war in the anti-shipping dive-bomber role in 1939 and were still specialists in that role.  Alongside the Ju 88 torpedo-bombers of KG 26, KG 30 were operating from northern Norway against the Arctic Convoys during 1942.\n\nFortunately for the Allies the Germans didn't learn the real reason for their success against PQ17.  Goering claimed it was all due to the Luftwaffe, while the Kriegsmarine were a bit closer when they claimed it was the combination of U-boat and aircraft.  In fact it was the threat posed by the major surface vessels which had proved decisive against PQ17 and which gave the U-boats and bombers their chance.\n
