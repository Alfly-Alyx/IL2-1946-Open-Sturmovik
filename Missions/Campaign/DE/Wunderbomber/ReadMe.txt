'Wunderbomber' v1.0

This is a training campaign for the Ju 88.  Various semi-historical missions cover the following methods or tactics used by the Ju 88:

Mission 1 - solo, high-alt level-bomb
Mission 2 - formation, level-bomb
Mission 3 - formation lead, dive-bomb (static tgt, AB bomb)
Mission 4 - solo, consolidation exercise, dive- and low-alt bomb
Mission 5 - solo, instrument approach
Mission 6 - solo, night blind bomb
Mission 7 - formation, low-alt bomb (AB bomb)
Mission 8 - formation lead, dive-bomb (ships at sea)
Mission 9 - formation lead, dive-bomb (warships at sea)

Skins - I've used skins that come with the game, apart from a nice He 111 desert skin, which I assume came from my net cache, as it's not in my downloaded skins folder.  I named it 'Med~43'.  If you know who made it let me know and I'll give the credit due.

Difficulty settings - up to you, although I would always recommend turning off 'No Instant Success'.  I generally design missions for realistic settings, but for training and 'debrief' purposes I would have 'External Views' on.  Also make full use of the pause and slow motion features to track where your bombs go compared to the aiming point in dive attacks.  The whole point of the campaign is to learn something, so check out how well you aimed and how well you matched the desired weapon release parameters.

Installing:

Unzip the downloaded zip into your Il-2 Sturmovik root directory and everything will find its place.  To activate the loading screen and menu music provided (or to delete the files if not wanted), navigate to:

samples/Music/Menu - rename current file 'de' (eg, debak) and then rename new file 'Petersburger' as 'de'. 

Missions/Campaign/DE - rename current TGA file 'background' (eg, default or Mistel) and then rename new file 'Wunderbomber_background' as 'background'.

Thanks to JastaV for the music, which was cut from a compilation of his, available at M4T.
