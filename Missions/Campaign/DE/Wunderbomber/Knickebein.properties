Description You should be getting used to flying on instruments now, which is a skill that will get a good workout in this mission.  The WPs have been set up to simulate a blind-bombing system aimed at an enemy city.\n\nThe first German blind-bombing system was called 'Knickebein' and used 2 Lorenz radio beams.  One beam was aimed at the target and the bomber flew along this beam.  The pilot heard morse dots or dashes depending on which side of track the bomber was, and a steady tone when on track.  A second beam intersected the first at the bomb release point.  As there was little warning that the release point was being approached, along track accuracy was less than lateral accuracy.  To overcome this drawback (and British countermeasures) a new system, 'X-Garet' used 3 cross beams to give the navigator/radio op warning and a countdown to bomb-release.  It also added a cockpit needle for the pilot to follow in place of (addition to?) the Morse dots/dashes.\n\nFor this mission you have a type of Knickebein system, but with the X-Garet cockpit indication (ie, the usual WP pointers).\n\nClimb to 5 km and, as you don't have to worry about wingmen in the dark, cruise at 100/90.  Your first WP is at Sosnovy Bor, where you will pick up the first Lorenz beam.  From BB9 the WP 'pointers' will flip over to 090, pointing to WP3, the bomb release point.  Your bombs will fall to earth 4 km beyond WP3, so you need to stay on the 090 track if they are to hit the centre of the designated target area.  If the pointers are indicating a track to WP3 of more than 090, then you are north/left of track and need to come right to correct, and vice-versa.  It takes 9 mins to get to WP3 from WP2.\n\nAs Leningrad is approached pay more attention to your cockpit indications.  When the needles swing around onto 240 or so, drop your SC-1000 bombs. This simulates crossing the second beam.\n\nFor the rest of the mission you are tuned to the 'IV' (Ida-Viktor), which is a beacon located on your airfield.  \n\nSkin: Ju88A4_east_winter_night.bmp\n\nHISTORICAL NOTES\n\nThe British anticipated the sort of system likely to succeed X-Garet and quickly countered Y-Garet when it was introduced, leading the Germans to lose their faith in these blind-bombing aids.  So, I'm not sure if these beam systems were ever used in the East, but as there's no map of Britain for v4.08 Leningrad will have to be the target for this mission.\n\nThese Lorenz beam-based systems proved very accurate during the Blitz of 1940/41 (better than most daylight 'precision' bombing and far better than Bomber Command would be for a couple of years yet).  A British examination of the damage inflicted during a raid on Birmingham carried out by just the He 111s of KG 100 (all with Knickebein), found that almost all the bombs landed within 100 m of a line running through the target area.  That would have been the centreline of the 'main' beam.  A few nights later KG 100 acted as pathfinders for the whole bomber force and Coventry was destroyed.\n
