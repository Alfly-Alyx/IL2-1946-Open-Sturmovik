Description Now you've done a couple of level-bombing sorties and had a look at being a follower, it's time to introduce dive-bombing and give you a turn at leading a small formation.  We'll also have a look at a new weapon, the AB-500 cluster bomb.\n\nLeading the AI is pretty straightforward, as they seem to know your power setting and respond instantly to match whatever you set.  Just remember that humans aren't so omniscient.  Cruise at a speed which will allow stragglers to quickly catch up, don't make large / sudden power changes and don't just close the throttles to slow down.  Default formation for AI Ju 88 is Vic, but you may order them into whatever formation you wish.  There are just 3 ac today.\n\nThe Stuvi dive-bomb-sight uses the same TAS and height inputs as the Lofte level-bombing sight.  You tell it the speed and release height, and it senses the dive angle, which allows it to calculate the impact point and display it as a tick mark in your gunsight view.\n\nThe AB series cluster bombs could carry a variety of sub-munitions, with different types being mixed in the same dispenser.  In game the AB-250 (not available to the Ju 88) carries many small anti-personel bomblets; the AB-500 actually carries fewer bomblets, but they are bigger and can deal with armour; and the AB-1000 carries incendiary bomblets which can ignite a large area.  With all these bombs the Delay setting determines the time interval from weapon release to bomblets being dispensed.\n\nYou may have noticed on the last mission that flying over big towns, like Bastogne, wasn't such a good idea.  Important things, like towns and airfields, tend to be heavily defended, so avoid them when you can.  Your route today avoids known 'hotspots' and your navigator will keep you on track if you follow his headings, ie, follow the ac-shaped needle on your compass or match up the top - desired heading - and bottom - actual heading - readings on the direction indicator.\n\nEarlier this afternoon recce located a large group of SB bombers neatly lined up at Leninsk airfield.  We think they have flown in ready for some imminent operation.  There is just time to launch a small raid, under cover of the overcast present today, before it gets dark.  Fly out taking advantage of the cloud cover and pop-up to 2500-3000 m just before the target to give yourself enough height to dive-bomb.\n\nLocate the target and get it lined up under the nose.  Either 'push over' into your dive or do as the AI do and roll over into the dive as you pass overhead - about 8-10 sec after target disappears under your feet.  The latter method tends to give a steeper - more accurate - dive.  Bomb the largest, westernmost concrete pan, the one with the SB bombers on it, then lead your crews home.\n\nA drop height of 600-700 m and a delay of 2.0-2.5 s gives a dense bomblet pattern from a steep dive, suitable for a tight group of small targets like tanks.  For the more dispersed target in this mission use 0 s delay and a 1500 m release height to give a bigger beaten zone.  TAS will be around 500 kph with the dive-brakes extended.  Drop both pairs of bombs when you hear the warning horn at the pre-set altitude.\n
