Short Solo Ju-88 raid\n
Description Familiarization with the Ju-88\n\nOn the engine power instruments (rpm and 'ata') you will notice red, yellow and green marks:\n\n - The red marks correspond to the max allowable power (2600 rpm & 1.4 ata).  This was used for take-off (& emergency) and had a 1 minute limit in real life.\n\n - The yellow marks correspond to 'climb & combat power' (2400 rpm & 1.25 ata).  As the name suggests this was used for climb and combat, and had a 30 minute limit.  This is 90/90 ('prop pitch'/'power') in game and will not cause an overheat, even in the climb with rad closed, so could be used 'forever'.\n\n - The green marks correspond to normal cruise power (2250 rpm & 1.15 ata).  In game setting 80/80 gives this.\n\nWith all the above power settings the ata will drop off above a certain altitude when the supercharger (sc) can no longer maintain that level of boost.\n\nOn the runway:\n - Trim - rudder 10 right clicks\n - Flap - take-off\n - Tailwheel - locked\n\nPower-up and roll down the runway.  With a typical load, like today, you should be able to rotate at 180 kph.  Bring the gear up once airborne and then take the flaps up one stage, to 'combat flap'.  There is a marked tendency to sink on fully retracting the flaps, so delay this until 220 kph and 200 m.  Then come back to climb & combat power, 90/90.  Climb at 240-250 kph for best performance.\n\nIn the climb:\n - Trim - elevator nose-up as required to fly at 240-250 kph, rudder/aileron if needed, but should be fine as is.\n - Notice the ata start to drop after about 2000 m.  The sc changes gear automatically around 3500-4000 m (3000 m in real life).\n\nClimb to 6000 m, which should be reached around WP3.\n\nIn the cruise:\n - Power - set cruise power, 80/80\n - Trim - elevator nose down, rudder left, as required to keep the ball centred and to maintain altitude 'hands off'.\n\nAs speed builds you will need more nose-down and rudder-left trim, but flying long distances will be much easier if you can trim for 'hands off' straight and level flight.\n\nOn the compasses you will notice aircraft-shaped needles.  In co-ops and offline missions these point to the next waypoint in your flightplan.  As you head across the North Sea you should find that the needle is pointing roughly 250 degrees.  Follow the needle to your target.\n\nAt 6 km you can cruise easily at 80/80, but for the level-stab to hold level on the bomb-run you will need to go up to 100% rpm & 90% power.  Put the power up to 100/90 about half-way across the North Sea - 5 mins after WP3.  Set your altitude on the bombsight (actually height above target, but the target is at sea-level today, so it's the same thing).  A long-standing game bug means the actual TAS (bomb-aimer/navigator has a TAS-meter in front of him) is not quite right when set on the bombsight; you need to set a value a little less than the actual value.  Setting bombsight TAS to 400 kph should give pin-point accuracy.\n\nOn the bomb-run:\n - Engage the level-stab.\n - Adjust left/right by applying rudder trim (for gross corrections use multiples of 10 clicks, up to 30 or so).\n - Engage bombsight automation when cross hairs are over the target.  With the correct speed set they will slowly drift back towards you at first - disengage automation, let the sight move forwards onto the target again and re-engage.  As you get closer they will remain stationary over the target, until the bombs are dropped automatically.  \n\nIf the sight continues to move backwards, you need to reduce the TAS setting on the bombsight; if it moves forwards you need to increase the TAS setting - (sight moves back = TAS back; sight moves up = TAS up).\n\nBombs should drop when the sight has reduced to about 33 degrees elevation.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTE\n\nAs the daylight phase of the Battle of Britain drew to a close in the autumn of 1940, the Luftwaffe resorted to raids around the coast by bombers flying singly or in small groups.  This mission simulates such a raid on the RAF's seaplane base at Sullom Voe in the Orkneys.\n
