Name 2
Short Level bombing in formation\n
Description The last mission introduced high level bombing as a single aircraft.  For this mission you will need to hold your position in a formation of 5 aircraft (ac).\n\nSo that you have enough power (ie speed) in hand to quickly make up any lost ground and hold formation, the leader will cruise at 80/80 power, which should give 300 kph IAS.  Today we cruise at 3 km, where level-stab will almost cope on a sensible cruise power setting.  It may still drift down slightly when 'properly' trimmed; to hold height apply a lot of nose-up trim, although this makes control tricky when you disengage level-stab.\n\nAssemble on the leg to WP2 at 500 m and 250 kph.  Formation will be a 5-ac Vee, with you occupying the outside left position - you should be able to close in closer than the AI opposite you in the #4 position.  From WP2 the leader will climb at 250 kph, turning right onto 260 when passing through 2 km at WP3, to level off at 3 km just north of Wilz, WP4. \n\nRemember your individual target is the Morane factory: the 3 medium buildings to the left of the pair of large factories in the centre of the industrial area.  Make your own bomb-run, which should not take you out of formation much at all.  Settings for the bombsight should be 330 kph TAS, 3000 m ALT.  After bombing continue ahead and tidy up your position in the formation.  Collective defence is your best hope against enemy fighters.\n\nDuring the descent and slowdown back at base, the leader should keep some power on at all times; if he closed this throttles his followers could not slow down any more (save by use of dive-brakes) and could not prevent an overshoot if it looked likely to occur.  Descent will start at WP8.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTES\n\nOperation Paula, 3 June 1940.  Paula was the opening of the second stage in the blitzkrieg on the West and was designed to destroy the French Air Force.  Not only were airfields to be knocked out, but aircraft factories were also on the target list along with other industries in the Paris area.\n\nKG 51 was the sole Ju 88 unit in Luftflotte 3, covering the drive through the Ardennes and into France.  Therefore, for this mission you fly for KG 51, although the fighting had moved on, of course, by June - but there is no Paris map.\n
