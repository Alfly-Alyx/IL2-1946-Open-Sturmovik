Name 1940 00\tBremen
Short Tommy bombers in daylight\n
Description Date: January, 1940\nTime: 10:00 hrs\nWeather: Good, clouds at 1500m (4500ft).\n\nGood morning pilots, \n\nthe observer post west of here reports enemy bombers flying east at about 4000m (14000ft). They have observed at least 12 Blenheims, possibly more, and have calculated that these will be in W25/26 in 12 minutes from now.\n\nIntercept them! They can't be allowed to bomb the Bremen shipyards!\n\nFly north after assembling over the field, climb to 4500m (15000ft) in W25/ 26 and find those bombers!\n\nGood luck.\n\nSkin: ZG76 unmk.bmp\n\n
