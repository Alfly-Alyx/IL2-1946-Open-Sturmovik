Name 1943 07\tZitadelle day 8
Short Prokhorovka or bust!\n
Description Date: July 12th, 1943\nTime: 1130h\n\nWeather: hazy, clouds at 1400m.\n\nBackground: \nIn july 1943, the biggest tank battle ever takes place.\nDue to good intelligence the german attack is no surprise for the red army; the russian defensive lines around and in the Kursk salient have become deep and extensive. The only place where the Germans actually pose a threat to Kursk is in the south, but the offensive slows down seriously around Prokhorovka already. \n\nMission:\nIt's yet more tactical support today. Fly to Prohkorovka and take out the field guns and trucks that were spotted there in F5 NP8. Leave the new russian fighters well alone, only attack bombers if you happen to run across them. There may or may not be some FW190's in the same target area. \n\nGood luck!\n \nSkin:\n5ZG1_G9_IN_blank.bmp\n
