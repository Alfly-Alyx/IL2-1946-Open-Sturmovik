Name 1941 09\tFrostbite
Short The reckless push for Moscow\n
Description Date: November 1st, 1941, 1500 hrs.\nFlying weather: good, clouds at 1500m\nMission type: low flying tactical attack, 60 minutes\n\nBackground: \nThe Luftwaffe has taken up positions right behind the front once again. The battle for Moscow is about to begin.\nThe Russians, apparently having learned from the opening phase of Barbarossa, are pulling back their forces further behind the front. \n\nMISSION: \nThe first strike today was aimed at Kubinka airbase; this one is aimed at at Istra, a mere 40 kilometres from Moscow. German spotter planes report some activity at Kubinka, and a fuel supply column at Istra.\nAfter crossing the front line, you must stay low, because of the FLAK being deployed everywhere.\nUse your ground proximity meter, ideal for the flight. Stay under 125m. to avoid the 85mm AA guns.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Wespe_Winter.bmp\n\n
