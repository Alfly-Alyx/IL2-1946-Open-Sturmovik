Name 1944 03\tRhubarb
Short Spitfires at dusk\n
Description Date: March 1944\nTime: 2030hrs\n\nBackground:\nfrom 1943, RAF fighters were assigned to fly 'rhubarb' missions over occupied France. The main objective was to destroy as many trains and vehicles as possible, disrupting traffic and cutting supply lines to the units at the proposed invasion beaches. These raids continued well into 1944.\n\nMission:\nGet airborne this minute! Radar reports fighters flying low, in a pair, crossing the french coast at altitude to evade light FLAK. Trains are their main target! This means they will fly very low. Intercept them as soon as possible. Fly your pattern at 2000m (6000ft).\n\nSkin:\nBf110 G-4 NJG4.bmp\n
