Name 1940 06\tHouffalize hotspot
Short Strongpoint attack\n
Description May, 1940\nTime: close to 0900hrs\n\nIt's hazy, and there is a 900 metres cloud base.\n\nBackground:\nWith total dominance almost a fact for the Luftwaffe, blitzkrieg is a succes. \nThe Allies, however, put up the occasional fight. Hotspots are created with anti- tank guns and AAA whenever possible. \nThe Zerstorer units are roaming free and have yet to encounter real opposition. Their intended tactical role is being fulfilled all the same: ground attack and aerial battle.\n\nMission: \nYou are among eight of ZG76's Zerstorer today, and you are ordered to fly to Houffalize, to check whether the Stukas have left anything that needs "mopping up". \n\nThen, continue on to Laroche (B3), and look around for all types of vehicles, such as trains, staff cars etcetera. You know what to do. Then, continue to B4/ C4; if the enemy is running to the west, you're bound to run into quite a number of vehicles there. \nOperational altitude at your own discretion but not above 1500m.\n\nSkin:\nZG76 unmk.bmp\n
