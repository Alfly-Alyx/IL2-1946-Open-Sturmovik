Name 1941 07\tVyazma salient
Short Closing the circle\n
Description Vyazma, autumn 1941\nTime: 0800hrs\nWeather: good, clouds at 1500m\n\nVyazma is about to be closed in. Like Smolensk, the city gets surrounded quite quickly. \n\nThe Germans want it encircled so its garrison won't be able to participate in the defence of Moscow, but rainfall has slowed the panzers down and you are requested to assist in the destruction of those Soviet units that are retreating to the East.\n\n\nMission:\n\nGood morning men!\n\nWe have received orders to attack the Russian escape route from Vyazma, the Moscow highway. You'll find it northwest of the city; destroy anything you find on it! The parallel railroad may also be attacked.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: default\n
