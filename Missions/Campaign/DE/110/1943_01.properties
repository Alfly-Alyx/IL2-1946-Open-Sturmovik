Name 1943 01\tSchlusselburg
Short The Leningrad- Ladoga link\n
Description January 17th, 1943\nTime: 1000 hrs, weather: clear.\n\nBackground: \nIn 1941 the advancing german forces trapped the russian forces in Leningrad by advancing on the left bank of the Newa to lake Ladoga. In August 1942 the Leningrad front and the Volkhov front tried to relieve Leningrad, but to no avail. The same movement is tried again later, in January of 1943, by russian forces from both east and west. The advance starts on January 11th and after 6 days, the area around Schlusselburg and Lipka is re- taken, leaving a narrow gap for german forces to escape. This gap, also known as the "corridor of death" is closed after January 18th. The railway, however, remains in german hands, so the relief of the starving city is only marginal.\n\nMission: \nWe must eliminate the russian rocket launchers in BM9 NP3.\nIvan is trying to destroy our retreating vehicle columns. If possible, the bridge at Mga must be saved - by slowing the russian advance - to allow our troops to fall back to Mga. Many lives depend on you!\n\nSkin:\nWespe_Winter.bmp\n
