Description Date: September, 1939\nTime: 0600 hrs\t\nFlying weather: It's a bit hazy today; if there are clouds, they will probably be around 1500 metres.\n\nBackground: \nDuring the polish campaign, the Bf110 was used in a variety of roles, one being the freie jagd. After many escort and close support missions, the freie jagd was always welcomed by pilots. The high scoring gruppe shot down 30 aircraft over Poland, adding to a feeling of invincibility of the 110.\n\nMission:\nToday, we go hunting over Lvov; one group will lead, the other will fly cover above it. Good hunting!\n\nATTENTION: air start.\n\nSkin: (set with arming / aircraft customization)\nMD_BF110_BOP_RLM707165_2_ZG76_NoMarkings.bmp\n
