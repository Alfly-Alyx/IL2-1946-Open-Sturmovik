Short Bombers over Berlin\n
Description Berlin, early 1945\ntime 1500 hrs, flying weather: poor\n\nUntil late in the war, the Luftwaffe even sends up night fighters to intercept formations that have become separated from the main bomber force. The night fighters suffer losses because of their relative inexperience in daylight operations against box formations. \n \n\nMission:\nToday, you have to take your night fighter up in broad daylight again. \nFind those "dicke autos" and shoot them down!  \nGet back safely so we can prepare for a next raid.\nUser loadout is free, but 4 x Wfr.Gr. 21 is recommended.\n\nAttention: air start.\n\nSkin: \ndrewesNJG3.bmp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis campaign was researched and constructed entirely by 1.JaVA_Sjonnie, for release via www.1java.org exclusively.\nPermission for re-issue under other names or descriptions, or from other websites is not granted.
