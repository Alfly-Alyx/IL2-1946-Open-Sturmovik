Name 1942 10\tStalingrad
Short Prevention strike\n
Description Date: October, 1942\nTime: 3:00 PM\nFlying weather: hazy, clouds at slightly below 1500m.\n\nMISSION: \n \nThe Ju 52\u00B4s that are unloading here today might be targeted by the enemy very soon. \nWe suspect the VVS wants to use the long range of their twin- engined fighters to intercept our transport aircraft on their way back to army group "mitte". There is no better way to defend the transports than by means of a pre-emptive strike at their airfields.\n\nTwo Zerstorer flights will destroy the attack planes. You will fly with them.  After take/ off, fly to N9 and stay right on the deck. In N9 climb to 1500m for an attack out of the sun.\nAt Leninsk, destroy any enemy planes you run across. Beware of single- engined fighters from Volzhskiy. Your target is to destroy ground targets at the enemy airfield, AND  to be back within one hour to reload for a second strike.\n\nGood luck!!\n\nSkin: default\n
