Name 1939 06\tPhoney war
Short The chase is on\n
Description January 4th, 1940\nflying weather: good, clouds at 1300m\n\nBackground:\nAfter the start of the war in 1939, to Germany's west, a prolonged "phoney war" begins, with either side trying to reconnoitre the other, without any real battle ever taking place. Every now and then, PR planes cross into enemy territory and try to gather intelligence. These missions are nobody's favourite because of the bitter cold in the winter of '39.\n\nMission: \n\nEnemy overhead! \nan enemy Blenheim has been spotted, it's really close and it looks like it's lined up to take pictures of our Hangelar airfield! Scramble and make sure they don't get their information delivered. Enter enemy airspace if you must, but shoot that Blen down!\nTake off and start climbing to 2000m over Houffalize, that's roughly vector 240. \n\nYou also must be back within 30 minutes.\n\n\nSkin: \n10823-HaifischMe110.bmp\n
