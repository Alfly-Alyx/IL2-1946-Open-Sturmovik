Name 1940 01\tFall Gelb
Short Dutch surprise\n\n
Description Date: May 10th, 1940\nTime: 0500 hrs\nFlying weather: good.\n\nATTENTION: AIR START\n\nBackground:\nHaving studied the polish campaign, the dutch army has reorganised AAA and airfield defences.  That is the reason why Fall Gelb, expected to be a walkover, costs the germans 358  planes in 4 days, mostly transports (220) like the Ju 52. The first postponement of "sea lion" becomes a fact long before the battle of Britain commences.\n\nMission:\nTogether with the Stukas you will make sure the airborne assault troops can land at Waalhaven safely. Take out the enemy's strongpoints if the Stuka's fail to do so. \nLittle Opposition is expected; don't worry about it but deal with it like you did in Poland, make your experience count and be back in time for lunch. Good luck.\n\nSkin:\nBf110C-5 Unmarked.bmp\n\n
