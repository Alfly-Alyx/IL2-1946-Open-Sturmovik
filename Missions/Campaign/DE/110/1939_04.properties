Name 1939 04\tFall weiss day 15
Short Race to Romania\n
Description September 16th, 1939\n\n1400 hrs/ weather good, clouds at 900m\n\nBackground:\nThe polish campaign is drawing to an end. The Russians have also invaded Poland.  In this simulation, the government decides that exile is the best option and so they leave for Romania. \n\nMission: \nGet in your plane immediately and take off to the southeast! This might be the only chance to prevent the Polish government to get to allied territory. Rumour has it they are flying out in a modified bomber. There is no time to check the story out. We will give you a vector once you're in the air, if our observers spot that bomber.\n\nThere's only one problem: you only have 50% fuel as we have no time!\n\nAttention- AIR START and you have a 15 minute timeout on primary target.\n\nSkin:\nMD_BF110_BOP_RLM707165_2_ZG76_NoMarkings.bmp\n
