Name 1942 02\tMedyn bridge
Short Fast recon\n
Description Early 1942\n\nThe Russian winter offensive is in full swing. It threatens Vyazma in this sector, and the offensive must be stopped. \n\nFly to Medyn, and make potographs of the area's vital bridge and airfield. They will be bombed later today, in an attempt to stop the flow of armor to the front.\n\nReturning to base with a set of clean pictures is your only task. Even if you encounter enemy patrols, use your speed to get away, and don't engage in fighting. \n\nGood luck.\n\nSkin:\nGeschwader_BF110G2Winter.bmp\n\n
