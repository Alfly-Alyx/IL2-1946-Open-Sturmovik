Stuka's and destroyers are among the most feared german planes. \nThe Bf110 will be used for the first time as it was too late to see action in Spain; so, it goes into battle almost untried.\n\nMission:\nyour Zerstorergeschwader will fly a seek- and- destroy mission, flying via Pshemyisl to Shyretsz; intelligence from the reconnaisance units tells us the Polish government is preparing to fly to Romania, so make sure any planes you find there get immobilized.\n\nOperational altitude: at your own discretion but not above 1500m.\n\nSkin: (set with arming / aircraft customization)\nMD_BF110_BOP_RLM707165_2_ZG76_NoMarkings.bmp\n
