Name 1940 09\tFreie Jagd
Short French fries\n
Description June, 1940\n\nWith the event of Dunkirk the BEF have retreated from mainland Europe and the French are on their own. \nThe French arm\u00E9e de l'air has gained valuable experience in the five weeks of war so far, however, and air battle is becoming somewhat difficult for the Zerst\u00F6rer, just as they are relieved of endless escort duties and strafing.\n\nMISSION:\n\nToday you will finally do a free hunting mission!\n\nFly to Caen, and engage any aircraft you see. \nIf you are unable to get the upper hand, you could fly a "defensive circle". \nThe French seem to have problems with aircraft maintenance, as their patrols now seem to be a mix of aircraft types; but since no 109's are active in this front sector today, recognition shouldn't be a problem: If it's a single- seater, shoot it down!\n\nSkin:\nBf-110_nm_02.bmp\n\n \n
