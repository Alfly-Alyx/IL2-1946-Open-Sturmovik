Name 1942 10a\t\tStalingrad II
Short Secret Soviet stockpile\n
Description Date: November 19th, 1942\nTime: 1630 hrs, weather: good\n \nThis morning, a massive Russian offensive has started. They have planned their offensive as a pincer movement, to enclose the 6th army at Stalingrad.\nThe south- eastern sector is under attack from the Soviet 64th army under Shumilov.\n\nMISSION: \n\nAn army Fw189 Uhu has reported a fuel dump and HQ, which are obviously to support the main Soviet thrust. The enemy has reached sector i3 already. If we can hit their fuel dump, the advance might be slowed down considerably!\nThe least it will do is prevent Ivan from re- fuelling his tanks under cover of the night...\n\nClimb to 1500m (4500ft) and fly vector 140-150 to M/N 2 where the HQ and fuel dump are hidden in the village of  Khoyr Khuduk. \n\nYou'd better hurry up if you want to be back before it gets dark...\n \nGood luck!!\n\nSkin: default\n
