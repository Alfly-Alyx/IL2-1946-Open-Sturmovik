Name 1940 04\tThe Meuse bridges
Short Attack in the Ardennes\n
Description The Ardennes, May 1940.\n\nFlying weather: hazy. Time: 1000hrs\n\nThe Germans are smashing through the allied lines everywhere, and are strolling around the Maginot line except for a battle at section A2 near Longuyon. The Stukas make most AA crew and tank commanders panic. The panzers are either advancing in large, wedge- shaped formations, or crawling along the small valley roads. Overhead is a protective umbrella of planes.\n\nMISSION: Climb to 1750- 2000m over St Vith, then turn west to vector 270 and go into a shallow dive. This should bring you over the airfield that RAF 112 squadron use for their bombing missions near the front. \nOn the way back, attack the usual targets of opportunity. Your target is to destroy all vehicles and bombers you find at Manhay and get back before lunch.\n\nSkin:\nBf-110_nm_02.bmp\n
