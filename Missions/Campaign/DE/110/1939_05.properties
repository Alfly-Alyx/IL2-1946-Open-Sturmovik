Name 1939 05\tPhoto recon
Short Intelligence gathering mission\n
Description April, 1940\ntime: 0800 hrs\nConditions: good\n\nBackground:\n\nBefore anyone in Europe realised how soon the war was to begin, German high command sent out many people, posing as tourists, to the countries that were to be invaded. They took pictures, made notes, and compared these with other spies' notes. \nAfter many trips the plans to invade France and the low countries were finalised based on this information. \nEarly in 1940, many photo reconnaissance missions had to be flown to verify the information. \n\nThe Bf110 subtype C-5 was a special reconnaissance version carrying 2 cameras.\n\nMission:\n\nWe need a good set of exposures of the airfield at Margerotte, and of the Laroche bridges defence. You may meet enemy patrols. If so, use your speed to evade them. we really need those photos! \nTargets: reconnoitre the airfield within 20 minutes, Laroche within 25, and be back at base within 45. Good luck.\n\nSkin: \nBf110C-5,1940..bmp\n
