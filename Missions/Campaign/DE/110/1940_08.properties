Name 1940 08\tEscort
Short French campaign bomber strike\n
Description Date: May, 1940\nTime: 1100hrs\n\nBackground:\nrepresentative for most bomber strikes in France were those where the He111 was escorted by Bf110 only. Early results were very one- sided and led Luftwaffe high command to believe that the Bf 110 could hold it's own in a dogfight with single- engined fighters. The first tactic to become a Bf110 specific one, however, was that of the defensive "circus" circle. You might even need it today... \n\nMission: \nToday, the Margerotte airfield will be bombed by KG51. you must see to it that the bombers get back safely to where they started ten minutes ago. They're on their way here now. So, take the map of the Bastogne area and be ready to go in 15 minutes. \n\nSkin:\nZG76 unmk.bmp\n
