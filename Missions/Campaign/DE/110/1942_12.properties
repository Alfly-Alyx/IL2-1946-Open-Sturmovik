Name 1942 12\tSicilian shores
Short Convoy patrol over Messina strait\n
Description Date: October 26th, 1942\nFlying weather: hazy. \n\nATTENTION: AIR START \n\nBackground: \non October 23rd, Montgomery launches his attack at el Alamein and starts pushing Rommel back to Tunisia. About six weeks ago, in early September, Rommel -determined to chase the british all the way to Egypt- had to halt his advance for lack of fuel.  Because of allied air raids on axis shipping, the fuel crisis deepens quickly for the Afrika Korps. Axis fighters and fighter- bombers are assigned to shipping protection duties in an attempt to give the fuel tankers that sail from Italy some form of cover.\n\nMission: \nyou are in for a long maritime reconnaisance patrol over the Medirerranean. A fuel convoy has sailed through Messina strait today, headed for Tobruk. \nThe previous two tankers were sunk at Tobruk just days ago, so we must provide constant cover for the tankers this time. \n\nProtect the fuel tankers for 20 minutes against enemy bombers or torpedo bombers at any cost. \n\nSkin:\nBf-110E2of9ZG26_nomark.bmp\n
