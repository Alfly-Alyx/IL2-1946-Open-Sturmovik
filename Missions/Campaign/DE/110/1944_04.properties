Description August, 1944\n\nThis was one of those days for the night fighters. \nIn the north of Holland, a night fighter unit is scrambled in the middle of the day. \nTheir ace, Major Lent, is grounded for the day, as night fighter usually suffer heavy losses during daytime. \n\nMission:\n\nTake off immediately! A small formation of Liberators will pass through the sky near here; they have become separated from the main formation, which has just attacked Wilhelmshafen. \n\nThey do not seem to have any form of fighter cover, so get airborne as soon as possible, climb to 5500+ m and the controller will give you further directions. Loadout is free!\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin:\nBf-110_NJG1.unmarked 1.bmp\n
