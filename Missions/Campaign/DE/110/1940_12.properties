Name 1940 12\tBiggin Hill revisited
Short Erprobungsgruppe 210\n
Description Date: August, 1940.\nTime: 1600 hrs\nWeather: good, with scattered clouds at 900m.\n\nATTENTION: AIR START\n\nTypical of many days in this battle, low- level raids are carried out by bomb- carrying Zerst\u00F6rer which are all the more successful if the twin engined fighter is used as designed: using its speed to get in and out of the target area as quickly as possible.\n\nMISSION:\n\nToday you participate in a E.Gr.210 low flying attack on Biggin Hill. The way in is fast and low, as is the way out. This will be a battle of numerical superiority, which we think you might be able to win. Otherwise, just run for home base. Todays target (again): enemy fighters.\n\nSkin:\n4397-ZG26BoB.bmp\n
