Name 1940 10\tBrooklands
Short Attack on Hawker factory\n
Description September 4,th, 1940, mission starts at 1300\nFlying weather: hazy. \n\nATTENTION: AIR START\n\nBackground: on this day, the Luftwaffe flew a mission intended to disrupt Hurricane production at the Brooklands site. \nAround 13:15 reports came in from the ROC stating about 20 Bf110's were headed north, toward Brooklands. The bombed- up planes were all III/ZG76, the escort were all from 6/ZG76. They ran into 253 Sqn, who had sent up 9 Hurricanes from Kenley at 13:00 which were perfectly positioned for an attack, and attack they did, claiming six to none. The Bf110's that did get to the target area did'nt bomb the Hawker factory but the Vickers machine shops and assembly sheds- interrupting Wellington production for 4 days, but also claiming many worker's lives. \nRetreat cover was to be flown by the mixture of 110's and 109's which had attacked CH radar at Poling. units of Erprobungsgruppe 210 encountered 601 Sq. Hurricanes and shot one down.\n\nThis mission tries to recreate that day.The tactics described below are not historical.\n\nBriefing: \nToday, you will be on a fast raid on the Hawkers plant. As usual, we fake an attack on another town, then turn north in a shallow dive while accelerating to 450. Make sure you stay low until you're almost on top of the target. Don't forget to take out the AAA on the second pass. \n\nSkin: \nZG76 unmk.bmp\n
