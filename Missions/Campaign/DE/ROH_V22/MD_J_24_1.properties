Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nSeptember 14th, 1942\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThree days directly at the front!\nYou will never forget it. \n\nYour mechanics had to work under the permanent danger of enemy artillery fire.\nFor the first time you got an impression of what the war on the ground relly means.\n\nHard battles raged at the small hill southeast of the airfield. \nBoth sides attacked. \nYou often had to take cover in the trenches.\nYesterday, in the early morning you found yourself in the middle of the fights. The noise of war woke you up. Artillery fire, close combat man against man, with knifes, Bajonets, spades or with the blank hands.\nThe Russians coming closer.\nDeath everywhere. The smell of burning rotting meat. Mass attacks dying in the machine gun fire, blood, the crying of terribly wounded. Crying for help which never came, crying for home, never seen again.\nThe Russians reach the next trench to your's.\nYou threw handgrenades. The god of the trench, handgrenades. Fear. \nRussians break into your trench.\nPanic. You freeze.\nUnable to fight, unable to defend, unable to kill. Your eyes wide open. \nA comrade beating his spade into a young Russian's face. Cutted skins, Broken bones. Escaping breaths. Crying. Dying. Blood. Meat. Horror!\nAll Russians dead. The trench is hold. The survivers count, the victims count. Victory! Luck! Humanity beaten. \n\nYou thank god for beeing a fighter pilot. You pray never to see this again. Far away from the enemy. Alone in your machine. High over the ground. Away from the dirt. Away from hate. Away from inhumanity. Control but not panic. Fear but not horror.  \n\n\nThe planes are ready.\nYou hardly could await to get out of here. Enough fodder for your nightmares.\nThe 'Firlefanz' is loaden with wounded. You climb into the Bell.\nYou roll to the runway.\nAway from here, trying to forget!\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly the Bell to Osinowskij\n\nStartzeit: 23:20 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bell P-39N-1\n\nWetterlage:\nStormy, low cloud cover, nighttime.\n\n\n\n
