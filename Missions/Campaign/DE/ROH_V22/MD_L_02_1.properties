Description \nLuftflotte 6, Mittelsektor\nRaum Wyazma, westlich von Moskau\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nFebruary 12th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nRight after your arrival at Detschino the weather turned very bad. Deep mud on the runway made any flight operations impossible. You had some quiet days.\n\nA big operation is planned here in front of Moscow. Probably a major retreat.\n\nThe new 'Gustav- six' seems to be a twofold knife. Allthough better armed than the 'G-2' it's a backstep in speed. All that in a time where the Soviets are making great progresses with the technical level of their fighters.\nWho flies uncarefully will quickly be in danger. Teaching the rookies is of the greatest importance. On the other hand the production numbers of the '109' are raising. The Luftwaffe will be able to keep greater numbers of fighters in the air.\n\nAnother good point is that the Americans have reduced their supply deliveries to Stalin's Soviet Union. At the same time raw materials are delivered to Germany by France. Even the Lend - Lease deliveries are reduced.\nAllthough the Soviet production numbers still seem to be much greater than the German a change in the balance will favour the Luftwaffe a little bit.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd along Front.\n\nStartzeit: 09:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6\n\nWetterlage:\nStrong winds, satisfying visibility.\n\n\n
