Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nFebruary 4th, 1944\n\n===============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nTwenty minutes ago Major Ritter von Krohm was forced by a FlaK hit to emergency land behind the enemy lines. He managed to land on one of the many small islands.\nThe Soviets couldn't get him until now. If we are quick we should be able to pick him off.\n\nThe major problem is the enemy FlaK at Kaloz. As long as it isn't shut off, every attempt to land would be suicide.\n\nYou quickly made a plan:\nYou will cross the front coming over the lake between Siofok and Enying. At the time you are closing the place, two flights of the 3rd Staffel will attack the FlaK at Kaloz. Hauptmann von Calenberg will be above you to secure your flight.\nWhen you rech the place, search the Ritter's wreck and land on the island.\nYou want to fly back  via Polg\u00E1rdi.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nPick up Major Ritter von Krohm at waypoint 8.\n\nStartzeit: 08:10 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: Very low\nEinsatzmuster: He-111H-2\n\nWetterlage:\nFog, bad visibility.\n\n
