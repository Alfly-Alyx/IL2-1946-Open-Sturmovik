Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Lemberg\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nNovember 22nd, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nTogether with the other Staffel commanders of your Gruppe you are invited to a meeting with your new Polish comrades at the airfield Bolekhow.\n\nIn the morning you flew to Bolekhow and were welcomed by captain Drzyzga, the chief of the 112th Polish fighter squadron.\n\nAt the beginning the situation was somewhat strange. The relationship between the Germans and the Polands never were good since the last hundreds of years. When you saw captain Drzyzga's plane you recognized several aireal victories achieved against Luftwaffe planes. Beside red stars eight swastikas were painted on the side of his P-39.\nCaptain Drzyzga flew for the Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britain and eight German planes were shot down by him. Once he was the enemy and now he was about to become your comrade. And after this day he became a friend. With his charming but noble attitude he quickly opened up your and your comrades hearts. How thin the line between hate and friendship is.\n\nDuring your absence Major Ritter von Krohm stayed at Bschosuf to await the coming of your new American comrades. When the Polish officers heard that the cowboys would come this evening, captain Drzyzga decided instantly to fly to Bschosuf with you to welcome the new allies.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTake off after the other planes and fly home.\n\nStartzeit: 18:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-14\n\nWetterlage:\nStormy.\n\n\n
