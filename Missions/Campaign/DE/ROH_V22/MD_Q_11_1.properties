Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Lemberg\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nDecember 8th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe weather is very bad. No missions were flown since one week.\nThe Red Army began to roll up the Dnester line from the side after the connection with the air landing zone was established.\n\nFortunately the Wehrmacht was able to withstand all Soviets attempts to take the defense line at Pschemisl. Until now the lines are frozen at that place.\n\nNow the question is: Where will the Red Army go next?\nWill it go to the west deeper into Poland or will it attack to the southwest?\n\nThe route to the southwest would give Stalin the bigger prey.\nIf he could reach the Adria all Southeastern European countries would fall into his hands. The two transport routes from Hyirow and Bolekow would be a great help for an advance to the southeast to Uschgorod too.\n\nFor the Wehrmacht both selections would have good and bad points.\nIf Romania and Bulgaria would be cut off, a coordinated strategy would become impossible. On the other side an attempt to reach the Adria would divide the Soviet force into two parts. This of course would weaken Stalin's advance through Poland to Germany.  \n\n\nThe weather is slightly clearing up.\n\nNorth of Pschemisl the Soviets achieved a limited break in into the German defense lines. It seems possible that the enemy could try to pass the city in the north to cut it off in a later stage.\nAllthough the visibility is still bad you decide to take off to support our ground troops. When Major Dix heard of your plan, he immediately decided to come with you.\n\nThe Americans just took off. Now you are standing on the runway.\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nAttack the enemy tanks with bombs.\n\nStartzeit: Immediately \nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-14/R-1, SC-250\n\nWetterlage:\nStrong haze, stormy.\n\n\n
