Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor\nRaum Stalingrad\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nDecember 2nd, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nWith the first light a lonely Bf-109 landed at your airfield.\n\nYour new, provisoric Group Commander Major Hugo Zenker.\nMany rumors are cursing about him between your comrades.\nHe not only is known as a good pilot but as a master of solving bureaucratic problems too.\nThe legend says that he as a Staffel Chef three times has lost all his papers and files through enemy bomb attacks. Now the rumors says that he for himself is the strongest enemy of his papers an files. It is believed, that whenever an enemy attack on his airfield occured he himself blew up his bureau. For the supply troops Zenker is known as 'Muenchhausen' because he is able to organize everything by a few good placed lies.\n\nYou had not much time to welcome this unorthodox man.\nYour Staffel only has seven operational planes left. Every of the 1st and 3rd Staffel have only six planes left. The Italian Staffel can only put four planes in the air.\nSo improvisations have to be made. Staffel is Staffel and mission is mission. Now often planes from different Staffeln have to be used together in one flight.\n\nFor the next mission two Italian F-4 will be subordinated to you.\nBehind our lines a swarm led by Major Zenker will fly. He can be called via radio if nescessary.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd\n\nStartzeit: 10:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-2\n\nWetterlage:\nStormy, satisfying visibility.\n\n\n
