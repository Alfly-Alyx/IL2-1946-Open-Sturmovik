Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nJanuary 7th, 1942\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nYour Staffel exhausts.\nFrom the formerly twelve Bf-109F-4 only fife are currently ready for action, from the four Bf-109E-7/B only two.\nThe temperatures make it very difficult to keep the planes operational.\nYou learned very much from Russian pilots who were taken prisoner. Without their knowledge, not one German plane would fly today.\nThe whole propaganda about the Russian 'Untermenschen' (sub humans) was total crap. These 'Untermenschen' teach us 'Herrenmenschen' a hard lesson.\nThe german soldiers gained a high respect for their Russian opposites.\n\nStill the fights for Medyn are hard. Allthough the weather is terrible, the Soviets are able to advance.\nThe 4th Army desperately needs air support 17 kilometers northeast of the city.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nSearch and destroy Soviet tanks.\n\nStartzeit: 13:40\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109E-7/B\n\nWetterlage:\nSnowfall, overcast, stormy.\n
