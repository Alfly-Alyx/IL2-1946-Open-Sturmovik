Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nDecember 20th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nAgain for several days flight operations were impossible.\nTime for a readyness report.\n\nYour Staffel has left eleven planes. Only eight of them are operational at the time.\nThe two Bf-109G-6AS are really having some failures. Engineer Dr. Decker is working day and night to solve the problems. \nFive 'Gustav-14' are left. Allthough new the 'G-14' is ready developed and should go into series production immediately.\nFrom the Bf-109G-6v four planes are left. \nYour Staffel not only lost planes but some of the young pilots too. Two of them are dead, one is missed and two are wounded. \n\nOn the Red Side the losses are much higher but the numerical superiority of the Red Air Force is able to keep a lot more planes in the air than the Luftwaffe.\nWhen the full weight of the US Air Force will be transferred to Europe the tide will change.\nIn these weeks the Americans are transferring their 8th Air Fleet to Hungaria.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd\n\nStartzeit: 09:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-14\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny.\n
