Only a small corridor is held from the city to the west.\nThe Soviet losses are huge. The American artillery successfully holds the enemy infantry down. Only when the Russians are using tanks in masses they are able to gain ground.\n\nAllthough the US troops have a difficult stand the German leaders are very satisfied.\nMany German officers had doupts in the fighting quality of the Americans. But their  soldiers fight stubborn and brave and the American leadership doesn't seem to fear losses. America's full weight is coming into the war and sooner or later this will change the tide.\n\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd\n\nStartzeit: 14:45 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 4000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6/AS\n\nWetterlage:\nStrong winds, average visibility.\n\n
