Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nMay 11th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nWhen you came to Kromij at the 7th, you just were awaited by the Luftflotte.\nRight after your landing you were shown four American Bell P-39 fighters which had been captured from the Soviets.\nYou were given orders from the highest Luftflotte staff. You are ordered to train a couple of other pilots to fly the P-39. You were given four days for the training.\nOf course you recognized the camera equipment built into the fuselages of the Bells and you knew for what they will be used.\nThis time no discussions were allowed about the markings. The reconnaissance flights will have to be made with Soviet Red Stars only!\nFirst you wanted to refuse the order but on the other side you thought that you shouldn't let you comrades make the flights without you.\n\nToday the first reconnaissance flight have to be made.\nAll four Bells will go up.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nYou will have to cross the front at Ponirij. Between the waypoints 6 and 9 photos have to be taken. Before flying back you should climb to at least 3000 meters to be save from our own FlaK.\n\n\nStartzeit: 11:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500  und 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bell P-39N-1\n\nWetterlage:\nVery good..\n\n\n
