A good opportunity to fly the jet for some time.\n\n\nAt the moment all is quiet. Only occasional fights take place but nobody believes that the Red Army wants to stop here.\nFor the first time American ground troops in strength are standing in front of the Red Army.\n\nThe whole Hungary front is divided up in two big sectors. \n\nNorth of the Lake Balaton the German Army Group South is standing, commanded by Generalfeldmarschall von Rundstedt.\nThe 6th Army is placed above Tatab\u00E1nya.\nNorth of M\u00F3r the 11th Army has gone into position.\nBetween M\u00F3r and the northern edge of the Lake Balaton the fully rebuilt and refreshed 1st Hungarian Army is holding the line.\nAround P\u00E1pa Kleist's 1st Panzer Army, fully resupplied and refreshed, is holded back.\nThe battle worn 17th Army was pulled back to the Tapolca area at the western edge of the lake for refreshment.\n\nSouth of the Balaton the 12th US- American Army Group has it's sector. It's commander is General Omar Bradley who has his staff at Tab.\nHim subordinate are:\nThe 1st US- Army at H\u00F3g\u00E9sz under the command of General Hodges,\nand the 4th Polish Army.\nBehind the front near Kaposv\u00E1r the strong 3rd US Army commanded by General Patton is placed.\nBradley's reserves are the XVIII. US- Airborne Corps and the heavyly battle worn 2nd Polish Army at Nagykanizsa.\n\nThe American General Eisenhower is the supreme commander of all armed forces south of the 50th degree of longitude. North of him General von Manstein has the supreme command.\nSo all Hungarian, Czechian, Romanian and parts of the Polish forces together with the German Army Group South are subordinated to the American commander.\n\nIn the air the war was given a new strategical dimension by the US Air Force. From Bavaria and the Czechoslovakia it alone flies strategical missions against the supply routes of the Red Army.\n\nThe Luftwaffe together with special US fighter and bomber wings is allocated to the tactical support of the ground operations.\n\nThe fighter units are staggered behind the front according to their equipment.\nYour Jagdgeschwader 53 together with the Hungarian squadrons which are equipped with the '109' too, will be stationed very close to the front lines.\nBehind in the north, the units flying the Fw-190 and in the south the Polish fighter units with the P-39 are placed.\nFarer away from the front the jet fighters of the Jagdgeschwader 2 and the Thunderbolts of the 78th US fighter wing are stationed.\n\nYour IV. Gruppe will be placed at Kazsok and D\u00F3mb\u00E9var in the American Sector.\n\nYour friend Patrick Rosenberg welcomed you at Szobately. He gave you the Me-262 with the Yellow 3 and is pleased to fly with you.\n\nToday a commanders conference takes place at Veszprem.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to Vezprem.\n\nStartzeit: 06:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 4000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Me-262A-1\n\nWetterlage:\nMorning haze, sunny above.\n\n\n\n\n\n
