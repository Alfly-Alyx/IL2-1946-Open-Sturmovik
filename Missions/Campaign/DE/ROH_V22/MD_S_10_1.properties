Over 70 Percent of the men are dead or wounded.\n\nAs it seems the Soviet garrison was too well prepaired when the men landed. \nUntil to the moment when the transports with the reinforcements landed the battle was far from beeing decided.\nThe Luftwaffe lost five Me-323 and a couple of Ju-52 by enemy fire. Nearly 35 Percent of the Light Infantry died in the crashed planes before they could get out.\nThank god that finally the Soviets could be overwhelmed.\nNow it's quiet at the place. Quiet like on a cemetry.\n\nEvery time the Soviets could start a counter attack.\nAir Superiority over Seiskari is of the essence now.\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nJagdschutz until 07:45 Uhr\nYou are ready to take off with a swarm of Bf-109s and a swarm of Fw-190.
