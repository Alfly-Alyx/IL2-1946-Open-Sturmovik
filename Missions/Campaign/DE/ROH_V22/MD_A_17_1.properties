Description \nZ. b. V. beim\nGeneral der Jagdflieger, Berlin\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nNovember 5th, 1943\n\n=============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe world is changing\n\nNine months ago Germany was the seen by the peoples as the source of evil. Now Stalin is given this role.\n\nJust before Poland's ressurection it's existence is in danger again.\n\nThe Wehrmacht failed in stopping the Soviets at the old borderline.\nMany Polands believe that Germany didn't really try to stop the Soviets.\nThe Poland people was cheated too often by Germany. But at this time the Wehrmacht is the only force which is standing between Poland's revival and Soviet occupation. Germany and Poland will have to stay together allthough it's hard for the Polands.\n\nAt November 1st America declared war on Stalin's Soviet Union!\nEngland will follow. At the moment an English delegation is visiting Moscow.\nIf they won't be able to stop Stalin diplomatically, the United Kingdom will change the sides. \n\nThe Red Army is still advancing. Tarnopol is encircled and Lemberg will soon be reached by the Soviet troops. The first Soviet reconnaissance planes were sighted over Germany. Now a line has to be found where the Soviets can be stopped finally.\n\n\nIn the last weeks you worked at the Bf-109 improvement program. You tested three different versions together with General Galland.\nThe Bf-109G-6AS with it's new engine still makes some problems but the plane is in a much better readyness state than the Bf-109G-10. The many problems with the 'G-10' have led to a third version which could be go into production very soon, the Bf-109G-14.\nIt's not as sophisticated than the 'G-10' and uses an engine without the 'AS'- improvements but it's reliable and could be front tested immediately.\n\nYou, with your Staffel shall take over the front evaluation of the G-14. Yesterday you got eight planes of the type. If it's successfull it could be go into mass production immediately. At the same time you were given two G-6AS. It's further development shall be made under front conditions. The G-6AS is the base for the Bf-109G-10.\n\nFrom now on your Staffel has eightteen planes.\nBlack 1 and Black 9 will be the two Bf-109G-6AS. For the first time you will fly a plane with the number 1 at the fuselage. To calm down your luck you ordered the Staffel painter to draw a '3' at the nose too.\n\nYou will have a second plane too. It will be one of the Bf-109G-14 and this will wear your 'Black 3'. The other seven G-14 are numbered 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. \nThe rest of your Staffel will fly the older Bf-109G-6v with the black numbers 2, 4, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17 and 18.\n\nDuring the whole test and evaluation program the Engineer Dr. Arnold Decker will stay with your Staffel. Allthough he is a good pilot you must not let him fly missions other than test flights. Decker has no fighter training is only at your unit for development purposes.\n\nUntil you finally will transfer to the front your Staffel is stationed at Landsberg. Yesterday your men flew to Landsberg. A problem with the 'Black 9', a Bf-109G-6AS, forced you to stay one day more at Schoenwalde.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to Landsberg.\n\nStartzeit: 19:10 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 5000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6AS\n\nWetterlage:\nRegen, st\u00FCrmisch\n
