He obviously wanted to take off again. Before he managed to fly away, he was taken prisoner. He had no time to destroy the plane. So the LaGG fell into our hands in good condition.\nDuring the night some mechanics repaired the plane.\nWith your expieriences as a former test pilot you were asked if you are able to fly the plane to a German airfield. \n\nWhat a question. Of course you are!\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly the LaGG to Katni. A Rotte(Pair) of Bf-109 will secure your flight..\n\nStartzeit: at once\nEinsatzmuster: LaGG-3\n\nWetterlage: \nFoggy, light winds.\n
