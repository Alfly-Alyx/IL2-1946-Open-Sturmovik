Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Kursk Nord\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nMay 17th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\n\nLage:\n\nThe reconnaissance mission at the 13th ended in a fiasko.\nThree of the four Bells didn't come home.\nThe Russians aren't stupid. Two days the the flights were successfull. \nThen the Soviets recognized what happened.\nAt least the flights brought important informations.\n\nYesterday you were informed that the new operation called 'Wallenstein' will be launched today.\n\nThe idea of  'Wallenstein' is to stop the southward advancing Soviet forces at Belgorod by an offensive thrust from the north, from Kursk.\nFor their advance to the south the Red Army has weakened it's forces here at Kursk. It is hoped that the Soviets don't take a German attack into account.\n\nOperation 'Wallenstein' will be launched in two steps. First an attack shall be conducted onto both sides of Fatesch. With it the majority of the mobile enemy forces shall be held in the western area of the Kursk arch.\nOur main attack force, the 1st and 3rd Panzer Armies are positioned northwest of Livnij. Their thrust will be launched one week after the attack on Fatesch. The aim is to pass the city of Kursk east and to advance to the south right in the back of the Soviet offensive at Belgorod. \n\n\nThe first air operation will be the attack on the airfields located around Kursk.\nYour target is the airfield at Ponirij. You have to secure a group of Stukas.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nAttack the enemy airfield at Ponirij. \n\n\nStartzeit: 01:20 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6/R1 SC500\n\nWetter:\nClear night.\n\n\n\n
