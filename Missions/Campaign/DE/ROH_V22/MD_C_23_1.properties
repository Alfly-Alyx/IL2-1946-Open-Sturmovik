Description \nLuftflotte 3 / Kanalk\u00FCste\nRaum Caen\n\nVersuchsjagdgruppe 8 (z.b.V.)\n\nJune 23rd, 1943\n\n=======================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nTwo wonderful summer days.\n\nGrandcamps de Bains is a nice place. \nCpt. de Fabre and you become friends immediately. He is a great and noble man and a just better pilot. \nDuring the German invasion of France he achieved four kills against the Luftwaffe and seven more during the Battle of Britain. Now, you, a German and he, a French have become comrades. \nIn these days Cpt. de Fabre has to fight his former comrades, the Britains. Some of them have become his friends too. \nCrazy times indeed!\nYesterday and today the Britains didn't come to the Normandy coast and you had two calm days, lying on the beach in the sun.\n\nCpt de Fabre had just heard, that you will get soon totally new planes. He offered you to fly the P-38 if you would allow him to fly the Bf-109Z.\nAllthough strongly forbidden for him like for you, you instantly decided to make the deal.\nThis morning you made two flights with the Lockheed. \nWonderful!\nFor you, the P-38 is the most beautiful plane you ever saw. And flying it is nearly as nice as it is looking.\nThis would be the plane the Luftwaffe is so hardly ltrying to develop: A great fighter, much better than the Bf-110, with two engines and a good range.\n\nThe evening is coming and the meeting in Grandcamps les Bains is ending. For your flight back, Cpt de Fabre again gave you the P-38 of Lt Bendot. He'll ride in the Gladiator.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTake off to the eastern direction after the other planes and fly back to Vire / St. Paul\n\nStartzeit: ... immediately\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: low\nEinsatzmuster: P-38J\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny evening\n
