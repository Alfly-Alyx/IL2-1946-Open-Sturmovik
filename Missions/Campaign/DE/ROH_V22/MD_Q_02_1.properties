Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Lemberg\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nNovember 20th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nIt's all quiet at the front.\nAs it seems the Soviets are prepairing an operation to cross the Dnester. At the same time the Polish and German forces are strengthening their defense lines. Everybody knows that the war will go on.\nThe Dnester is a monstrum. It will be very difficult for the Soviets to cross it. Many soldiers and officers are sure that it is the ultimate defense line. You are not so sure. In this war the Russians more than once semmed to be beaten, they allways recovered. More than once the Russians seemed to be under control, they allways had a surprise on hand.\n\nIn the north the Red Army is advancing again.\nTwo days ago Brest fell. The northern defense line was penetrated at several places. Again the Wehrmacht is together with the Polish units on the way to the west. When will the Red Army finally be stopped?\n\n\nYesterday Oberstleutnant Totenfeld visited you and surprised you with astonishing news:\nThe additional Staffel you are awaiting at your airfield will be a Squadron!\nThe cowboys are coming!\nThe American 82nd fighter squadron will be stationed together with you at Bschosuf.\n\nYou were elected to brief the first American fighter unit here at the Lemberg front. You are curious about your new comrades.\nUnbelievable! How the times are changing. The Polands, the Americans, together with us. \n\n\nIn the last days the weather was very unstable. Not many missions were flown.\nToday it's looking somewhat better and you take Faehnrich Stahlschmidt, Feldwebel Voss and the new Unteroffizier Ortenstein for a Freie Jagd mission.\nLeutnant Rosenberg will fly behind our lines. He can be called via radio if nescessary. \n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd\n\nStartzeit: 07:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6/AS\n\nWetterlage:\nStrong winds, morning haze.\n\n\n\n\n
