Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Lemberg\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nDecember 13th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe Adria!\n\nStalin wants to the Bakan. That's sure now.\nIn the north the Red Army is still advancing to the west. Slow but unstopped.\nThe Army Group South is building up a new major defense line at the lake Balaton together with Polish, Hungarian and together with an American Army.\n\nThe military strategy here is to slow don down the Soviet advance. Time has to be gained. That's not easy.\n\nThe 2nd Polish Army was totally destroyed at Drogobitsch despite their brave attempts to hold the place. They stayed too long. The 17th German Army was subordinated under the Polish high command to fill the gap and to show the Polish leadership that Germany stands to his ally.\nAt least the Polish leader has learned that an immobile defense only strucks his forces into pieces. A mobile defense with retreats and counterattacks is of the essence \u00E1gainst the overwhelming Soviet forces.\n\nTogether with the Americans a final counter offensive will be launched in Hungary. There three American Armies are reaching their positions in these days. Two additional Hungarian Armies are just building up their defense line. The German Army Group South which only has two and a half Armies left here at Lemberg will be restrengthened by two fresh Panzer Armies at the Lake Balaton. Additionally preperations are underway to resupply the two battle worn Armies of the Army Group when it arrives the Balaton Area.\nThen the two Polish armies will get fresh troops too.\n\nSince midday it's clearing up.\nWhen you reported your readyness to the Luftflotte you immediately were ordered to make a JaBo attack against attacking enemy tanks at Starij Sambor..\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nAttack the enemy tanks with bombs.\n\nStartzeit: 14:10 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-14\n\nWetterlage:\nStrong haze, stormy.\n\n\n\n
