V. beim\nGeneral der Jagdflieger, Berlin\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nJuly 22nd, 1943\n\n=============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nSince four days you're back at Schoenwalde.\nMany things have changed and a special task is waiting for you.\n\nMeanwhile, the complete testing and evaluating of fighter aircraft has been concentrated here. To support the fighter development programs a special unit was created, the Versuchsjagdgruppe 8 (VJGr.8) (Fighter test group 8)\nThe VJGr.8 is deployed at two airfields. At the airfield Schoenwalde and the airfield Sperenberg.\n\nThe VJGr.8 contains three Staffeln:\nThe 1st Staffel here at Schoenwalde is built up to test and evaluate the German fighter type programs.\nThe 2nd Staffel tests and evaluates captured foreign fighter types at Sperenberg.\nThe 3rd Staffel owns six regular Bf-109G-6 and twelve Fw-190A-5. They are used as sparring partners for the numerous development- and foreign types. Beside this task the 3rd Staffel frequently is used to defend the airspace east of Berlin against enemy bomber attacks.\n\nIn these days the first jetfighters from a regular serial production are delivered to the Jagdgeschwaders in the west.\nThe Jagdgeschwader 1, 2, 26, 27 and the just builded up Jg-50 will recieve one Gruppe with the Me-262 each.\nUnder the command of Oberst Novotny the Jagdgeschwader 7 is about to be built up around Oldenburg. This Geschwader will contain three full groups only with the Me-262.\nIn the coming days the VJGr.8 will get a 4th Staffel with sixteen jetfighters too.\nSo at this time more than 300 jetfighters are made operational at the western front.\n\nGeneral Galland told you that a deciding operation, called operation 'Geisterbahn', is planned against the English bomber threat. The jetfighters will play an important part in the upcoming operation.\nSince four weeks many 'Experten' have been called to the Reich and are just training to fly the Me-262. \nYou will be a part of it. That's why you were ordered to come to Schoenwalde with some of your best pilots.\n\nIn the next days you will have to train your comrades Faehnrich Rosenberg, the two Oberfeldwebel Braque and Duval and the Unteroffiziere Stahlschmidt and Aissner to fly the Me-262.\nDuring your absence from the Eastern front your friend 'Kiki' Kirsch will care for the refreshment of your 2nd Staffel / IV / Jg-53.\n\n\nToday the first training flights for your comrades with the Me-262 are standing on the program.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nRoll to the runway and take off. Fly a training flight with your comrades.\n\n\nStartzeit:15:20 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: bis 7500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Me-262A-1\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny summer.\n\n
