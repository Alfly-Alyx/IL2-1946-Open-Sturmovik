Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nJanuary 21st, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nFor your outstanding achievements as a fighter pilot and for your talents in leadership you were promotet to the rank of a 'Hauptmann'.\n\n\nLage:\n\nThe things are developing to the good.\n\nGermany and France signed a peace treaty.\nIn about ten days the retreat of the Wehrmacht from France will begin.\n\nBoth countries were the greatest enemies for such a long time. From the times of Napoleon who occupied Germany, over the war of 1870/71 when Germany overwhelmed France, over the First World War which brought the Versailles treaty, until today when France was invaded by Germany. The two peoples fought each other too often, too long. A real peace in Europe won't be possible without an end of the enmity between France and Germany.\n\nIn the coming month an agreement with Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands will hopefully come.\n\nThe Goerdeler Government really wants to find peaceful solutions for Germany, it's neighbours and the occupied countries. Of course great distrusts reign the occupied countries and often the new intentions of the new German government are not believed. However, you hope that the time will heal the wounds.\n\nOn another field Hitler's death and the new defensive politics of the Goerdeler Government shows progresses too.\nAmerica is sending careful signals to the new Germany. It seems that the will to go into war against Germany is undermined by the peaceseeking politics of the new Germany. America wanted to fight for the liberation of the countries Hitler had invaded. Now as Germany has started to end the occupations for itself America seems to be willing to take other solutions into account.  \n\nAllthough still in a formal state of war, America, Germany and all other countries under German occupation are invited to talks in New York. \nStalin made stipulations. He insists on a conditional surrender of the Wehrmacht, the paying of reparations by Germany and the frontier line of the Hitler- Stalin pact. \nA surrender of the Wehrmacht  of course isn't acceptable for Germany and the frontiers of the Hitler- Stalin Pact were refused by Poland and the USA. So before the talks began, Stalin declared that he won't send a delegation to New York.\nEngland will come to New York. Churchill still wants to keep the pressure on Germany. From the German point of view, Churchill's position is unpleasant but understandable. However, Germany has stopped all attacks on Great Britain. \n\n\nIn the morning you were informed that your Staffel is in Berlin to take over the new planes. So you will be alone for some more days, without your comrades.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nLand at Smolensk\n\nStartzeit: .. it's just 19:52 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny, average winds.\n\n\n
