Description \nZ. b. V. beim\nGeneral der Jagdflieger, Berlin\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nOktober 13th, 1942\n\n=============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe new strategical concept of the Reichsregierung (government of the Reich) finds it's first answers. Allthough no talks have started to other powers so far the first contacts are made.\n\nUntil contracts can be achieved, the war goes on.\nSo does the war against England.\n\nWinston Churchill declared that he at this point won't  end the war as long as German troops are still standing in so many countries. He said that he can't deny his pact with the Soviet Union. A peace with Great Britain won't be possible without a final solution which garantys the integrity of all occupied countries including the Soviet Union.\nBut to show his good will, he changed the strategical aim of his bomber war.\nNo longer whole cities in Germany shall be attacked, but isolated industry capacities shall be the targets for his bomber fleet.\n\nSince two weeks the new strategy come into effect. \nOther then attacking one big city with one big attack consisting many hundreds of bombers, the Royal Air Force now attacks many different targets with many different small bomber formations all at one time.\nAs many bombers as before are used but divided up in a great number of small groups. \nThese small formations conduct their attacks at lower altitude to hit their targets with greater chances and to lower the collateral damages.\n\nFor the German fighters defense this strategy isn't an easier work, because it became a hard task to direct the fighters to their targets.\nIt has to be seen that it is very complicated to counter fifty to hundred different formations attacking at the same time using different, very often crossing flight paths.\n\nGalland wanted you to gain a picture of this new kind of bomber war.\n\nYou only had to wait four days until you got the opportunity to get an impression.\n\nA small formation of bombers is returning from an attack on a factory on Liegnitz!\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTake off and intercept the enemy bombers which are flying at 3000 Meters altitude . You should be able to meet them at Kuestrin. The bombers are on course from the south- south- east.\n\nStartzeit: Immediately\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 4500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Fw-190A-4\n\nWetterlage:\nNighttime.\n\n
