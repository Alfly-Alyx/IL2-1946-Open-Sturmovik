Description \nLuftflotte 3 / Kanalk\u00FCste\nRaum Caen\n\nVersuchsjagdgruppe 8 (z.b.V.)\n\nJune 28th, 1943\n\n=======================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe airwar between the Arme\u00E9 de L'Air and the Royal Air Force is becoming harder.\nYesterday another attack against the port of Le Havre was flown. Again both sides had great losses. The Britains seem to try to block off the French support for Germany at all costs.\nThe still weak French air forces are fighting back as good as possible but they are not able to put the number of fighters into the air as needed.\n\nIn the meantime the whole affair is inflicting a bad thrust onto the British- American relationships. Good for Germany and France!\n\nFor the first time the IInd Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 26 has come into action yesterday evening and it immediately got a bloody nose from the fight as did the Britains. \nThe French pilots are really good. With their mostly outdated planes they achieve good successes against the Spitfires but they have to pay their toll too. With up to date planes the French are in no way inferior to any other air force.\n\nThis morning you will fly your first coast patrol together with a French swarm of P-38s.\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTake off and fly behind the P-38- swarm which will take off right after you.  Follow them along the patrol route.\n\nStartzeit: 09:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 6500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109Z\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny, light haze.\n
