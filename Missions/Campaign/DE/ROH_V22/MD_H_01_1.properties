Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor\nHalbinsel Krim\n\nIII. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nApril 28th, 1942\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nIt was very late when you left Dudschanij.\nIn the meantime the night came.\n\nSince you are are a member of Jagdgeschwader 53 the Gruppen were never stationed together. Like a fire brigade the different Gruppen of the 'Pik As'- Geschwader were transferred from one spot to another.\n\nNow the IInd Gruppe iteself has to be divided up. It's 2nd Staffel is ordered to Dnepopetrovsk for supporting the operations against the partisans.\nSo your IInd Gruppe will reach the Crimean Island only with two Staffeln and every of them will only contain a minimal number of eight Bf-109F-4 and four Bf-109E-7B.\n\nAs it seems there are not enough fighter planes in production in the Reich. Mainly bombers are built and that could be a bad mistake in the future.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nLand on the Fliegerhorst Sovjetskij\n\nStartzeit: ...on the way...\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 2000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109F-4\n\nWetterlage:\nClear, soft winds, sundown.\n
