Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nFebruary 7th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nMany things changed in the Geschwader (wing).\n\nYour old comrade and friend, Hermann Totenfeld was promoted to the commander of the Jagdgeschwader 53.\nSo the personnell caroussel began to spin. \nYour former Staffelchef, Wilhelm Ritter von Krohm was promoted to a Major and has become the commander of the IVth Gruppe.\nYou are now the Chef of the 2nd Staffel / IVth Gruppe / Jg-53.\n\nLike many fighter pilots you are 'a little bit' supersticious. Normally, as the Staffelchef, your plane should wear the  number '1'. You insisted to keep your beloved '3' so your Staffel is the first in the whole Luftwaffe in which no plane wears the number '1'.\n\nHauptmann von Calenberg now commands the 1st Staffel and Hauptmann Alfred Hammer the 3rd Staffel.\n\nAt this time the IIIrd Gruppe is transferred to the east too. For the first time the whole Geschwader will be employed together.\n\nThrough the refreshment of your Staffel new pilots have come under your command. Between them: three volunteer foreigners. One Italian and two Frenchmen.\nFrom your old comrades only your friends Faehnrich Eulenberg, Feldwebel Braque and Lieutenant Kirsch are left in your Staffel.\n\nBetween the seven newcomers two are expierienced pilots: Feldwebel Patrick Rosenberg with just thirteen aereal victories and one of the two Frenchmen, Unteroffizier Vincent Duval with expieriences as a flight teacher.\nThe whole rest is coming directly from the fighters school.\n\nYou took a strong look at your newbies and you were very pleased to see that their abilities as pilots are really good. German, Italian or French, their flying abilities are great. If they learn to shoot and to hit, the battle can come.\n\n\nYesterday the whole Gruppe has reached Wiasma. Today the IIIrd Gruppe / Jg- 54 has left it's airfields. These fields your Gruppe will have to take over.\n\nThe majority of the 1st Staffel took off for their new Fliegerhorst at Medyn one hour ago. The 3rd Staffel transferred to the airfield Medyn- Forest two hours ago. \nNow your Staffel is about to transfer. You will be placed at the Fliegerhorst Detschino, the southernmost of the three fields of your Gruppe.\n\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to your new Fliegerhorst Detschino.\n\nStartzeit: 16:10 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6\n\nWetterlage:\nStormy.\n\n\n
