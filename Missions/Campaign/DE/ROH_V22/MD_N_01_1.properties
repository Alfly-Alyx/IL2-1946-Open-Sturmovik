Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nMay 7th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nFor one week your Gruppe had to wait at Lokot for the preparation of it's new  airfields.\nYesterday the 1st and 3rd Staffel transferred to Orel South. 45 minutes ago you took off with the remaining eight planes of your 2nd Staffel to your new Fliegerhorst Kromij. The Gruppe has to wait 20 more days until it will get twenty new planes and seventeen new pilots.\n\nAt the meeting with Oberstleutnant Totenfeld you learned that the Wehrmacht will launch a big attack operation here at Kursk to endanger the Soviet Offensive south of Kursk.\nThe operation shall hinder the Red Army in it's advance to the south.\nEverytime the Soviets attacked into the German withdraws. Now they are standing in front of Belgorod. Fortunately they are advancing only slowly but great parts of our withdrawing units have to be redirected to counter them.\nThis turns our withdraw in the south into a farce. Again the Soviets are able to hold our troops in their country.\nHere at Kursk an offensive operation hopefully will enforce the Red Army to stop it's attacks.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nLand at your new airfield at Kromij\n\nStartzeit: ... on the way ...\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6\n\nWetterlage:\nClear, sunny.\n\n\n
