Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nJanuary 13th, 1944\n\n===============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nFar in the north the Red Army has launched it's offensive against Warshaw.\nHere all is still quiet.\n\nFlying the Me-262 'Schwalbe' (Swallow) is like a look into another world. With it's speed and it's heavy weaponry the jet is big a step into the future allthough young pilots mostly have great difficulties to hit something with it. The slow acceleration enforces the pilot to keep the speed high. Never manouver too much! To be successfull you have to bounce with the greatest of speed onto your target, unlash a short snapshot fire and descend as fast as you came.\n\nYou fly a Freie Jagd mission together with Oberleutnant Rosenberg.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd\n\nStartzeit: 08:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 5000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Me-262A-1\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny.\n\n
