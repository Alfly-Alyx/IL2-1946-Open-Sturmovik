Today, the sun is shining again.\n\nThe Red Army managed to pass Marcali in the north. Now the enemy is moving southwest via Tikos which fell yesterday.\nMarcali is in great danger to be cut off but it seems that General Bradley doesn't want to give up the city.\n \nAt the beginning of the battle the Americans were an unknown force, heavily underestimated by many German officers. Now its seen how stubborn they can be.\nAs long as they have enough artillery and air support, they refuse to give up ground, allthough they are lacking a real effective anti tank weapon!\n\nAt the western edge of the Balaton the enemy reached the first positions of the 17th Army. \nSouth of Fen\u00E9kpuzsta the Soviets are attacking.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nAttack the enemy FlaK with bombs. Then secure the fighter bombers.\n\nStartzeit: 07:45 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Fw-190A-8\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny, low cloud cover.\n\n
