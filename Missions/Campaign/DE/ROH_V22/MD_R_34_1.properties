The BBC is reporting that tanks are on the streets in the capital. From one outer skirt of the city a firefight is reported.\nIt is unclear what really happens. The Soviet government hasn't given a statement until now.\n\nWhatever happens in Moscow, at the front the war is going not good for the Soviets.\n\nAt the Polish front the enemy advance has come to a standstill around Warshaw. In the eastern outskirts of the city the battle is raging. Several enemy tries to pass the city north and south failed. The Army Group Center and the three Polish Armies are withstanding the Soviet thrust.\n\nThe 8th US Air Fleet is successful in hindering the enemy supply system. The Soviets seem to have great difficulties to supply their troops. The enemy operations become weaker.\n\nHere in Hungary the enemy position is becoming dangerous.\nGreat parts of it's attacking units are in danger to be encircled.\nStill Kleist and Patton are gaining ground and still the Soviets are not reacting.\n\nYour Gruppe is advised by the Luftflotte to fly Jagdschutz over the 1st Panzer Army.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly Jagdschutz north of Polgardi (waypoints 5, 6 and 7) until 08:30 Uhr.\n\nStartzeit: 07:40 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 2000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6/AS\n\nWetterlage:\nMorning sunrise, strong winds, average visibility.\n\n\n
