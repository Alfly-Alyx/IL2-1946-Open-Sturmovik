Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor\nRaum Stalingrad\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nNovember 26th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe Red Army is advancing with great speed.\nThe weight of their thrust is surprising. The 1st Panzer Army is directed to this theater of operations but it will take some time until it can be here.\n\nFortunately the Wolga seems to be brake for the Soviet advance. But the river won't hold the Red Army for long. The Russians are just building at least two other crossings over the river.\nThe second good point is that the Soviet offensive at the southflank is going much worser.\n\nSince the night your Staffel is operational again. Together with you the Stab and the 1st Staffel are stationed here.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd. You'll fly with four swarms.\n\nStartzeit: 07:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 4000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-2\n\nWetterlage:\nMorning haze.\n
