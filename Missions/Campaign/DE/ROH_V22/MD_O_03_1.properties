Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor\nSchwarzes Meer, Krim\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nAugust 13th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nIn three days the German attack will be launched from the Dschankoj area!\nIn the Operation 'Balkenschlag' a German Panzer Korps containing two Panzer Divisions will have to attack from Grischino in direction to Nowoselowskoje. Then the main attack force will have to advance to the south to make contact with the encircled Romanian Corps. \nAt the same time a small battle group shall advance to the west to contact Oberst Senger's battle group.\n\nThe whole operation takes a great risk as the Panzer Korps attack will be made in the west. This will let the southeastern flank of the XXVI. Army Korps wide open to an eventual enemy attack by the 72nd Soviet Corps. If the German XXVI. Corps won't be able to withstand an enemy attack, the Crimean Island could be cut off as a whole.\nOn the other side the enemy Airborne Corps is very weak and witheout heavy weapons at the western wing so that the Panzers should be able to penetrate their lines easier.\nTo raise the ability to withstand an enemy attack from southeast, all heavy weapons from the XXVI. Korps and the artillery and all anti tank units of the Panzer Korps were concentrated at the southeastern wing of the XXVI. German Corps.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nMeet eight Me-323 transport planes and escort them to Simferopol.\n\nStartzeit: ... just on the way ...\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 2000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6v\n\nWetterlage:\nMorning haze, strengthening winds.\n\n\n
