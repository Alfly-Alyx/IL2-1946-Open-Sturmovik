Every few days a transport plane is coming from Regensburg with improved spare parts. From this your whole Staffel is profiting. The readyness status of your Staffel is as high as never.\n\nWhen the Bf-109G-6As is operational you love to fly it. It's powerful engine gives it an uncompared climb rate. Wonderful.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd\n\nStartzeit:15:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6/AS\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny.\n\n
