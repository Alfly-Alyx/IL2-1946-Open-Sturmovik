He said that he had read all your reports you wrote about the different enemy plane types you have flown. He was especially interested in your thoughts about the Soviet fighters compared with the '109'.\nHe wants you to support the development works on the Bf-109- program. He wants you to come to Berlin from time to time to fly new test types of the '109'. He wants to know, what you think about them compared with the new Soviet fighter types you will get the opportunity to fly too.\n \nIn Hitler's eyes the fighters play only the second role in air operations. You shall help to make the best out of the fighters, the Luftwaffe has.\n\nGalland stayed until yesterday afternoon and of course he wanted to fly the MiG too.\n\nThe evening before you sat together with von Calenberg, von Krohm and Galland. Suddenly the conversation came to the SS and their doings behind the front in Russia. Galland seemed to know something about that. He wasn't surprised to hear details from Hauptmann von Calenberg. You recognized that he knew it and as it seemed, he believed it!\nYou were shocked! If somebody like Galland doesn't refuse these rumors, then it must be true!\n\nBut can it really be true, that the Fuehrer himself is responsible for that?\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly back to Egorovo\n\nStartzeit: 17:45\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109F-4\n\nWetterlage: \nStormy, overcast.\n\n\n
