Description \nLuftflotte 2 / Mittelsektor, \nRaum Orscha\n\nIII. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 Pik As\n\n11. Juli 1941\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung\n---------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe Dneiper obstacle is taken.\nUntil now the Soviet reactions are weak. It seems that their Head Command still is lacking a detailed overview over the situation or they are lacking sufficent forces in the area to counter the threat.\n\nIn the meantime the spearheads of Guderians three corps are advancing deeply to the east.\n\nIn the north Generalleutnant Hoth advances with his XXXIXth and LVIIth Panzer corps against Vitebsk. Mogilev is cut off and it is only a question of time when Orsha will be cut off too.\n\nYou again will fly over the northern part of the south area, around Orsha.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly Jagdschutz (Area cap) over Orsha until 06:15 Uhr.\n\nStartzeit: 05:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 2400 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109E-7/B\n\nWetterlage:\nGroundfog, light winds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
