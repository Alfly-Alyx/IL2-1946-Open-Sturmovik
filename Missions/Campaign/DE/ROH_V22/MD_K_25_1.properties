If these informations are true the enemy could have stacked more troops in the encirclement ring than estimated. This could make the operation harder but could bring in a greater prey too.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTake off with two swarms and meet the Stukas at waypoint 3, altitude 3000 meters.\nEscort the Stukas to the enemy airfield Kachalino and attack enemy ground targets at will.\n\nStartzeit: 07:15 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-2\n\nWetterlage:\nStormy, morning sunrise.\n\n\n\n
