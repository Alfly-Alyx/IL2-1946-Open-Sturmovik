Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Lemberg\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nNovember 15th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe Red Army is still advancing.\nAt the moment it seems that it is going into two directions simultaniously.\n\nOne force is attacking straight to the west, to Warshaw. In the meantime this advance has reached Bialistok. There it met a defense line af three Polish Armies and parts of the German Army Group Center. At the moment, the German - Polish line is holding the enemy.\n\nThe second Soviet advance is going to the southwest.\nThere it succeeded in taking Lemberg. It seems that this force is ordered to finally advance to Yugoslavia, to the Adria at the Mediterranean Sea. At the moment this attack force is blocked by two Polish Armies and great parts of the Army Group South along the River Dnester.\n\nBehind the frontline in the southwest two Hungarian and one Slowakian Armies are working on a second defense line along the borders of their countries.\nIn the south the Romanian forces withdrew to their borders and are building up another defense line. \nThe Romanian forces were ignored and passed by the Red Army.\nIf the Red Army would reach the Adria, then Romania, Bulgaria, the Balkan and Greece would be cut off from Western Europe and sooner or later would fall in Stalin's hands.\nIf the Red Army would break through in the North, Poland would fall and Stalin would stand at the German border.\n\nThe USA are not willed to let all this happen.\nAll American ground forces which until now were stationed in England will be transferred to the continent.\nTwo more American Armies are loaded on ships in these days.\nAllthough it will take some time until these Armies will reach Europe, the hopes of the endangered contries are growing.\n\nAt the same time the deliveries of raw materials and trucks are showing the first effects. The Wehrmacht is able to strengthen it's transport capacities in the fighting units. The German Divisions are gaining the desperately needed mobility.\n\nFrom returned units Germany is refreshing or building up seven Panzer Corps. Every of these Corps will contain two Panzer Divisions one Panzergrenadier Division and one Motorized Infantry Division. As the front has come close to the Reich the supplies now are reaching the frontal units faster.\nThe supply problems which the Wehrmacht had to deal with in Russia are no longer affecting the operations.\n\n\nYour Gruppe was ordered to transfer to the Lemberg area. Together with several Polish fighter units you are ordered to secure the ground operations.\nBeside this your Staffel has to run the evaluate- and development program of the new plane types.\n\nAt November 22nd a second Staffel will come to your Fliegerhorst Bschosuf.\nAt the moment nobody is willing to tell you which Staffel will come.\n\nAgain the Bf-109G-6AS 'Black 9' made problems. Again you stayed by Dr. Decker until the repairs were finished. One hour ago you finally started.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to your new Fliegerhorst Bschosuf\n\nStartzeit: ... on the way ...\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6/AS\n\nWetterlage: \nGood.\n
