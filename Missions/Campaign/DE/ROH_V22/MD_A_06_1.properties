Description \nLuftwaffenbefehlshaber Mitte\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nJuly 23rd, 1942\n\n==============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nYour feelings are riding in a roller coaster.\n\nYou have seen a movie about the crimes Calenberg had ever talked about.\nIt can no longer be denied. Hasso von Calenberg was right. \n\nNobody can say what an impression these pictures will make on the people. It has to put a stop on the SS and the National Socialists!\n\nThe Wehrmacht has reacted immediately and has taken over the power in the Reich. Goering and Himmler were imprisoned and with them the most other high SS- and Nazi- leaders. \n\nThe provisoric command over the Wehrmacht was given General von Witzleben. He is ordered to reorganize the leadership in Germany.\n\nNow the big question is: What will become with the war?\n\n\nWhatever will come, you will have to go back to the front.\nUntil now it's not clear where you will be transferred to but you are ordered to be back in Romania at the 25th.\n\nFive days ago you have recieved your new Bf-109G-2. In the meantime nearly your whole Staffel has taken over the new type. Your comrades are stationed at the small airfield at Swiebodzin for the few days in Germany.\nThere you have to be back this evening. \nTomorrow you will have to fly back to Romania.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to Swiebodzin.\n\nStartzeit: 19:40 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-2\n\nWetterlage:\nAverage winds, average visibility.\n
