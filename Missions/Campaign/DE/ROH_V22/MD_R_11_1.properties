Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor\nRaum Balatonsee\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nJanuary 19th, 1944\n\n===============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe Americans have great problems to withstand the Russian attack.\nIt must be seen that the US Army is lacking an anti tank weapon with sufficient armor penetration to stop the masses of Soviet T-34, KV and JS tanks. The armor penetration of the standard 75mm anti tank cannon the Americans are using isn't satisfying.\nThe shock which demoralized the German soldiers in 1940 and 1941now is paralyzing the American troops.\nOnly the formidable American artillery and their fighter bombers are capable of stopping Soviet tank assaults. These ground attacks at low altitude make the American fighters vulnerable to Soviet fighters. \n\nOn the good side the strategical bombardemants of the Soviet supply routes seem to be successful. The Red Army is hindered to get it's masses of material to the front as before. \n\nThe American soldiers are fighting brave. May they have their problems with the Soviet tanks now, at the end their production capacities will decide the war.\nA huge battle of attrition has begun.\n\nOn both sides of Tab soviets tanks are attacking.\nFighter bombers were called for help.\nWith the first light the air support will have to start.\nThe men on the ground desperately need help.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nAttack the enemy artillery positions with bombs. The Thunderbolds will attack the tanks simultaniously.\n\n\nStartzeit: 06:45 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-14\n\nWetterlage:\nMorning haze, sunny.\n\n
