Often heavy weapons are left behind.\nThe Soviet offensive is so powerful that it wasn't possible to stop it until now. At some points German units are fleeing.\n\nOf course the movements of the Army Group South will have an influence on the operations of the Army Group Center.\nHere at the center of the Eastern Front the Wehrmacht will have to retreat faster than planned too.\nSmolensk will be given up soon. Your Gruppe will have to secure the nescessary movements.\n\nFrom the Crimean Island your Staffel had flown to Odessa and then to Kiew. In Kiew the Staffel recieved new planes and pilots. When the Staffel was at strenght again you flew to Orscha, where you took off a few minutes ago.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTransfer to your new Fliegerhorst Kasplya.\n\nStartzeit: ... on the way ...\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6v\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny but low cloud cover.\n\n\n
