His Army is permanently strengthened by the returning Kuban forces.\n\nAn other part of these Kuban- forces is directed to the area west of Kalatsch as a strategical reserve. \n\nYou are again assigned to secure Guderian's advancing panzers.\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd over the attacking forces of the 4th Panzer Army.\n\nStartzeit: 09:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-2\n\nWetterlage:\nLight dust, average visibility.\n
