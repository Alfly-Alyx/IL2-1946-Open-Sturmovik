Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor\nRaum Balatonsee\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nJanuary 27th, 1944\n\n===============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nIn P\u00E1pa you are stationed together with the IIIrd Gruppe / Jg-2.\nThe airfield is one of the major repair centers here at the Balaton, so all thirteen planes of your Staffel will be serviced.\nIn the next days you shall recieve five new Bf-109G-14 and some new pilots. Then your Staffel will be at full strength again. \nUntil then, you have not much to do.\n\nYesterday evening you met the Chef of the 2nd Staffel / III / Jg-2, Hauptmann Georg Teuffel. Of course you asked him if you could make some flights with him and his Staffel. \n\n\nThe Soviet offensive has reached Marcali. In the south the Americans are still holding Kaposvar and D\u00F3mbovar. South of Tam\u00E1si the Polands were able to hold an arc in the Soviet front. A threat for the left flank of the Soviets. \n\nAt the western edge of the Lake Balaton the 17th Army is going into position.\nThe way to the norrth at the western end of the Balaton has to be blocked at all costs.\nThe Army is not at full strength and it was placed there for refreshment and resupply. Now everybody is glad that it's there.\n\nNorth of the Lake the front is quiet but our reconnaissance has gathered informations about preperations for another enemy offensive. \nAt the same time the 1st Panzer Army is prepairing an attack to the southeast.\nFor this Kleist's 1st Panzer Army is pushed forward to the Kisb\u00E9r area.\n\nThis movement proves that the German leadership is sure that the Americans will be able to stop the Soviet advance in the south. It's a risk. Would the Red Army move around the western edge of the Balaton to the north, the whole German sector would be in danger to be cut off. Then the Panzer Army would be at the wrong place to counter the threat.\n\nBut the Soviet supplies seem to be hindered. The US Air Force seems to hinder the enemy supply deep in enemy territory. The Soviet's tank strength in front of the Americans is smelting away. The Red Army no longer seems able to transport the tanks to the front as quick as they're lost. Their losses during the transports from the factories in the east to the front in the west are as high as the losses at the front.\nThe value of a strategic Air Force!\nAt the same time Bradley's forces are still strengthened and until now Patton's Tank Army is held back.\n\n\nA couple of supply trains were observed in Siofok. Eight Focke Wulfs are ordered to search and destroy them.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nSearch and attack the enemy supply trains.\n\nStartzeit: 07:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Fw-190A-8\n\nWetterlage:\nMorning sunrise, clear.\n\n
