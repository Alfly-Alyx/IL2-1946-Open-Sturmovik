Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Vyazma, vor Moskau\n\nIII. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nOktober 14th, 1941\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n---------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe Wiasma pocket is cleared.\nA great number of prisoners and material have fallen into our hands.\nThe weather is still very bad. Nevertheless, our troops are still advancing. The greatest exertions have to be made by the soldiers for every movement. The Russians seem better being able to handle the bad conditions. Again the Soviet 'Untermenschen' are showing the German 'Herrenmenschen' how it is done. It's becoming clearer and clearer what a grotesque picture the German propaganda drawed of the Russians before this war. Now our exhausted soldiers have to pay the price for this arrogance.\nThe only luck for the Wehrmacht is that the Soviet military leaders are badly interfiered by their accociated political commisairs. The Wehrmacht ist still better lead. What would be, if Stalin wouldn't have killed his best Generals before this war.\n\nThe Staffel is held at the ground for the most of time.\nTime for talks with your comrades. Your Staffelchef (squadron leader) Hauptmann Totenfeld told you that he doesn't believe, that this war ever can be won. As he said a great part of the army officers don't believe that the Red Army can be wiped out, too. \nThen he spoke about rumors, that massacres on politicians, civilians and jews are done by German SS- troops behind the front. \nMany high officers are very concerned about these things, but some are not. At some occasions regular army units were used to support the SS in these crimes. \nTotenfeld argued that these things will make the war even harder. These crimes will be a welcome support for the Partisans. You were seriously touched by Totenfeld's worries. \nFor you, all this is hard to believe. Massacres on civilians?\n\nThe area south of Rschew is kept unsafe by a Partisan group.\nToday the army was able to make prisoners and gather informations. It is planned to start an operation against the Partisans this night. It is reported, that the Partisan group is supplied by MBR- floatplanes\nusing the lake south of Rschew for their landings.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nSearch and destroy the MBR- floatplanes\n\nStartzeit: 04:45 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: Tiefstflug\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109F-2\n\nWetterlage:\nShortly clearing, stormy, bad visibility.\n
