The Soviets are advancing very fast and two Armies still are standing south of Kiew. Now they have to retreat quickly or they will be cut off in the next days.\nIt was planned to hold the Red Army at Kiew for some time to reorganize the withdraw. The defense line didn't hold longer than nine days.\nNow again the fast retreat will enforce great losses in material and men.\nThe commanding officers of the Eastern Front now are looking at the coming movements of the Red Army.\nWill he turn south to cut off the two German Armies or will he attack on to the Balkan? Would the latter happen the whole of Southern Europe would be cut off from the west.\nHowever, the retreat has to be accelerated once more.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd\n\nStartzeit: 08:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6v\n\nWetterlage:\nHazy, stormy.\n
