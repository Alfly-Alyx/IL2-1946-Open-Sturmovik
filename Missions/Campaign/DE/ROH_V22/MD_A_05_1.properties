Description \nZur besonderen Verwendung\nGeneral der Jagdflieger Adolf Galland\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nJuly 18th, 1942\n\n==============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nEarly in the morning July the 14th you arrived Berlin.\nThe whole day you were interrogated by different Gestapo- and Luftwaffen- members about your expieriences at the 13th.\n\nYou didn't know what you could say. You hadn't any expieriences!\nYou were flown to the meeting point and had waited for Hitler's plane.\nThe only expierience you had, was that nothing happened!\nHitler never reached the meeting point. You had sent a message over radio when you were there and you have sent one, when you broke off the mission.\nAt the time of your landing in Smolensk some tumult still was raging and it took some time until you knew anything.\n\nIn the evening of the 14th, it seemed that your interrogators got the insight that you really didn't know anything and you were released from the investigation.\nHauptmann von Calenberg just waited for you.\n\nIt seemed that suddenly the whole Staffel was in Berlin. However, with him you drove to the airport Berlin Tempelhof. There you wanted to wait until you could take over new planes.\n\nFinally this morning the first new Messerschmitt Bf-109 'Gustav' were ready to be taken over. \n\nThe procedure hadn't ended when you recieved a message from General Galland. He wants you to come to the Luftfahrzeugerprobungsstelle (plane test site) Schoenwalde.\n\nAs you anyway have to fly in your new plane you decide to take the 'Gustav' for the flight to Schoenwalde.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly from Tempelhof to Schoenwalde\n\nStartzeit: 11:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-2\n\nWetterlage:\nStormy, foggy.\n
