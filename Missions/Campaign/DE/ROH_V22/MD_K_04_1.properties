Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nNovember 21st, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nYesterday when you came back from your mission you were called to the airfield Stalingrad - Pitomnik.\n\nYou were awaited by a Luftwaffe officer who had a very special order for you.\n\nDuring the last ten days the Luftwaffe has lost five reconnaissance flights over the Znamensk area. The Soviets are very careful to secure especially that airspace.\nOf course that behabour raised the interest of our high command in that place.\n\nAs the danger for our reconnaissance flights is too great somebody at the Luftflotte had a strange idea:\nA reconnaissance flight shall be made with a captured enemy plane!\nA camera was built into the left fuseledge side of a P-40. Because you are familar with the Curtiss you were asked if you would do the flight.\n \nYou wanted to do it until you saw the plane. It weared Soviet markings! After an unpleasent discussian you were allowed to paint onto the the plane what you want.\nThe half night you worked on the painting and after some tries you decided to make a compromise. From the far distant you wanted it to look like a Soviet plane. But from close range the German Balkenkreuz can be recognized. All in all this Curtiss now is the ugliest painted plane in the air over Russia. Perfect for this ugly mission.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly over Znamensk at low altitude and make the needed photos.\nStay close to the marked flypath. If you are identified as a German flee! Your Curtiss carries no other weapon than the camera.\nIf you are attacked by enemy planes, you can find Major Totenfeld loitering southwest of Leninsk. You can request help via radio from the ground control.\n\nStartzeit: 14:40 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter und tiefer\nEinsatzmuster: Curtiss P-40E\n\nWetterlage:\nChanging.\n\n\n
