Description \nZ.b.V. General der Jagdflieger\nAdolf Galland, Berlin\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nSeptember 22nd, 1942\n\n=============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe new government of the Reich and it's new military leadership have published their new strategical aims:\nReichskanzler Goerdeler's announcement was published in the radio and in all newspapers:\n\n1.) Germany's future can not be secured by conquests and war.\n\n2.) Germany's future can only prosper in an Europe of peace and respect, between countries of equal rights.\n\n3.) A return to the verdict of the Versaille Treaty can not be accepted by Germany.\n\n4.) Germany admits the rights of self- determination for all countries, inclusive those countries which are held occupied by German troops until today. \n\n5.) The new German government declares it's will to withdraw it's troops from all occupied countries and wishes to start talks about the regulations as fast as possible.\n\n6.) Germany admits the borders of 1937 including the integrity of Poland and the Tschechoslovakia.\n\n\nWhen you read the announcement you knew that this was the right way. \nLike many high officers and the majority of the soldiers fighting in the east you knew that the war can't be won. \nBetween those at home, who didn't see the war, who didn't see how far away Germany was from winning it, the announcement was seen and discussed with much more contradiction.  \n\nSome think that Germany should not give up what have been gained with the blood and the lives of the young soldiers. But you know that the war won't give Germany a future. The wehrmacht won't be able to beat Russia and in one or two years America will enter the fights. Then the overhelming foreign forces will beat Germany.\n\nGeneral Galland wants you to become an advisor for a new body of experts: the 'Jaegerstab' (fighters staff). \nThe new defensive strategy will have to be reflected in changed military abilities. \nFor the Luftwaffe this means the reduction of the offensive-  for the strengthening of the defensive capabilities.\nMore fighters for less bombers. \nThe future of the fighters arm shall be discussed and newly planned. \nThat's what the 'Jaegerstab' shall do and Galland wants you as an advisor for it.\n\nToday the first conference takes place.\nA Focke Wulf is standing ready for you.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to Berlin Tegel\n\nStartzeit: 05:40 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Fw-190A-4\n\nWetterlage:\nMorning haze.\n\n\n
