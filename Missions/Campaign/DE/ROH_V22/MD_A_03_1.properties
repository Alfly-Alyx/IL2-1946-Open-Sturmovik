Description \nJagdfliegerschule Beerfelde\nbei Berlin\n\nJuli 28th 1941\n\n====================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nSince three weeks you made two to three training flights daily. You enjoyed every one of these flights. What a nice time.\n\nThen, at the morning of the 22nd, the reality broke into your life.\nGermany has attacked the Soviet Union without decleration of war.\nRussia! \nAnd in the west the war against England is still far from any decision.\nYour superior officers seem to have mixed feelings. They hardly have any enthusiasm for this step. Some are quite confident but the majority of them are not. You remember your father who allways predicted that Hitler will lead this land to it's downfall.\nIn those days you didn't want to believe him. Didn't the Fuehrer reach all the great victories with ease? Wasn't Hitler been right allways?\nYour father ever disgusted Hitler. You didn't understand his feelings and you often discussed with him.\n\nSince today your faith in the Fuehrer got it's first shadow.\nTwo fronts! Wasn't it this, what Hitler wanted to avoid? Napoleon marched deep into Russia. He invaded masses of country but failed to invade a victory. The National Socialists speak from the Russians as 'Untermenschen'.  You feel revulsion against the words of propaganda, which floods over Germany. What kind of war will this become?\n\nYour fighter training is nearly finished.\nIn four days you will leave the school. Then you will have to go to war.\n\n\nToday you were taken by surprise. In the first days of the air war in Russia, the Wehrmacht captured some Russian planes. These planes were brought to Teuplitz. You will have the opportunity to make some training flights against original Russian planes.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nAt waypoints 3 and 4 you are awaited by Russian I-16s.\nTake off and try to shoot some photos.\n\nStartzeit: 15:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109E-4\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny.\n\n
