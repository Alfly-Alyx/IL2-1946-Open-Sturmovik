Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nJanuary 15th, 1944\n\n===============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nYou enjoyed to fly the 'Schwalbe'. Sometimes you thoght to change to a Staffel which is equipped with it.\nThe Bf-109 is getting old and the Me-262 is the most sophisticated plane on the world. The time will come when piston engined propeller fighters will be detached by the new jet fighters.\nBut you decided to stay with the '109' until then. You love it. You remember your American comrade Major Dix who disliked the '109' when he flew it. The cramped cockpit. Claustrophobic he said. It's exactly what you love. The '109' isn't a plane. The '109' is more like a suit which let's you fly. When you enter it you and the '109' grow together. You don't enter the machine, you become the machine.\nYou will stay with the '109' as long as possible.\nThe times will come when it will be displaced.\n\nYour Fliegerhorst at Kazsok is ready.\nYour friend Major Dix called you. He won't be far away from you and he is pleased to see you again. He and your Polish comrades are stationed at Donyi Dubrava and you will act together at the same front sector.\n\nYour Staffel is ready to take off.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTransfer to your new Fliegerhorst Kazsok.\n\nStartzeit: 11:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-14\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny.\n\n
