Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Kursk S\u00FCd\n\nIV. Gruppe Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nApril 4th, 1943\n\n===============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe great conquest has become a great retreat.\n\nThe dictator is dead and the new government tries to save as much as possible.\n\nIn the name of Germany Hitler had started wars  and had gained great victories. Victories which tend to taste bitterly. The Wehrmacht still is standing deep in Russia and it seems that the retreat has to be gained harder than the conquest of the huge country was.\nThe German people and it's soldiers were drunken from the shining victories. Now, after waking up the time of the hangover has come. Still many would like to go back to pride and greatness but the majority of the men at the front know that \nthe way through Russia never lead to the desired destination. \nRetreat is not the way to pride.\nThe soldiers' aims have become smaller. A little quietness, a little security, a little comfort and a chance to survive.The war in Russia made them humble.\nRetreat is the way home.\n\nAt the walls of the staffs a thick line goes over the Russian map. The front. Now it shall be moved. To the left. To the west.\nThe front is a long line from Leningrad over Kholm, Smolensk, Orel, Belgorod down to Taganrog at the Azov Sea.\n\nOnly at Kursk the frontline is shaped like a big arch. If Hitler still would be alive this arch would have hypnotized him. An arch especially made for an attack.\nBut now, without Hitler, this arch will be the axle of the coming movements.\n\nNorth and south of the Kursk arch the frontline shall be withdrawn back to the west. The arch shall be erased by taking back the whole lines above and below.\nThe southern line will have to taken back first. Then the northern line.\nThat's why you're here. \n\n\nAgain the Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As' is scattered over the whole Eastern Front. The Ist, IInd and IIIrd Gruppen are deployed in the South to support the retreat. Your IVth Gruppe is deployed here around Belgorod.\nThe whole IVth Gruppe is ordered to transfer to the Podolhi. There it will be placed together with the IVth Gruppe / Jg-3.\nTwo whole groups on one airfield!\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTransfer with your Staffel to your new Fliegerhorst Podolhi.\n\nStartzeit: ... on the way ...\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny.\n\n
