Mai 1942\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nWhen you transfered to Simferopol you heard rumors about an emergency landed Bf-110 standing nearly intact at the hills northeast of Aloushta. When you asked the Luftflotte about the plane, you learned that it is just written off because nobody seemed to be willing to take the risk to fly it out. When you told Hauptmann von Calenberg that you would try it, he said nothing against it.\nSo you sent two technicians of your Staffel to the place to prepare the plane as good as possible.\n\nIn the early morning you came to the place to make your try.\n\nThe runway strip goes downhill, at the right side of the signal fires. Be careful!\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly the plane home\n\nStartzeit: Immesdiately \nEinsatzh\u00F6he: your choice\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-110G-2\n\nWetterlage:\nMorning haze.\n
