Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nFebruary 5th, 1944\n\n===============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe Red Army didn't achieve a breakthrough.\n\nIn the American sector Nagykanisza is standing like a rock in the wave of the Soviet attack. Allthough a full division is encircled in Marcali, General Bradley is still optimistic.\nAt the moment the VIIIth and IIIrd Armored Corps of Patton's Tank Army are brought into position north of the Balaton's western edge, right behind the German 17th Army. Patton's XIIth Armored Corps was sent to support General Hodges' 1st Army.\nEvery night the Americans are flying huge masses of supplies and troops into the Marcali pocket. \nAlong the southern flank of the Soviets the 4th Polish Army still is defending it's position.\nSoutheast of Csurg\u00F3 the first parts of Bradley's XVIIIth Airborne Corps went into position. \n\nIn the sector of the Army Group South the 11th Army still holds the line Oroszl\u00E1ny - M\u00F3r.\nBetween Szap\u00E1r and the Lake's northern edge the 1st Hungarian Army is fighting with bravour. \nAllthough the Soviets pushed the front in this area twenty kilometers to the west they couldn't enforce any real decision. Their losses are reported to be huge.\nAnd Kleist's Panzer Army still wasn't called!\n\nThe main focus of the battle in the northern sector is Szap\u00E1r.\nHeavy air battles are raging.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly Jagdschutz over the front at Szap\u00E1r, (waypoints 3, 4, 5 and 6) until 15:00 Uhr\n\nStartzeit: 14:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6/AS\n\nWetterlage:\nStrong winds.\n\n
