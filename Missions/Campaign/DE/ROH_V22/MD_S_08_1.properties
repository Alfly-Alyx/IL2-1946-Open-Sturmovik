Description \nLuftflotte 1, Nordsektor\nEstland, Golf von Finnland\n\n3. Staffel / Versuchsjagdgruppe 8\n\nOctober 18th, 1943\n\n======================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe man you picked up at Suursaari october the 16th is an Ukrainian Officer who has changed the sides from family reasons.  This night he will lead a group of 18 men in a special mission.\n\nTomorrow, in the early morning our attack on Seiskari will be launched. In front, west of Seiskari a couple of small islands are located. On one of them the Soviets are operating an observation and warning post. The place has a very short airstrip and a floatplane stop for supply purposes.\n\nTwo hours ago an old Russian TB-3 bomber was brought to Lavansaari. When you inspected the plane you saw, that it was prepaired to carry about 20 men of troops.\n\nNow, the idea is, to land the TB-3 on the small island to unleash the special forces group on the small place and to overtake the observation and warning facilities. It is hoped that when the Soviets recognize what happens the island is just under Major Konew's control.\nYou were asked to fly the 'Trojan Bird'.\n\nThe men are loaded and the engines are running...\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to the small island. The men will jump off the plane as soon you're landed. Turn around and fly home. Sounds easy, but the airstrip is very short and narrow. Be careful when turning the plane around for take off.\n\nStartzeit: 23:30\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 300 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: TB-3 4M-34R\n\nWetterlage:\nNight, light winds, dry.\n\n
