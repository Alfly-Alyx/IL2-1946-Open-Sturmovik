Description \nZ. b. V. beim\nGeneral der Jagdflieger, Berlin\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nJuly 24th, 1943\n\n=============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe Royal Air Force is attacking!\nWith more than 1000 bombers the RAF is about to attack numerous targets in the Reich.\nUntil now more than 70 different small formations were identified. It is very difficult to lead the fighters to their targets. The small bomber formations consist between 12 and 80 planes. They are permanently changing their heights and courses. The attacks are coordinated in a way that the bombers are at their targets at sundown, at night or at sunrise.\n\nGalland's operation 'Geisterbahn' has not yet started. So the jetfighters will still be kept on ground and the interceptions will have to be flown only with the prop fighters.\n\n45 minutes ago two swarms of the 3rd Staffel / VJGr.8 took off. Now you got a message that another small bomber formation was identified with course to Kuestrin. You and your comrades shall intercept it.\n\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to Kuestrin and await the enemy bombers there.\n\nStartzeit:19:40 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Fw-190A-5\n\nWetterlage:\nSundown, strong winds.\n
