Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Vyazma, vor Moskau\n\nIII. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nOktober 8th, 1941\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n---------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nYesterday and the whole night long the cut off Soviet forces had made attempts to escape to the east.\nThe occasionally rainfalls slowed down all movements. Ways become impassable and even greater roads become muddy more and more.\n\nOn the Feldflugplaetze (airfields without concrete runways) the flight operations become dangerous. If the weather won't clear up and the rain won't stop, only concrete runways will be usable for further flight operations. This situation hits both sides. Flights have become seldom and sporadic.\n\nSince the night the preparations on the airport Wiasma- North are running. That airport is completely concrete and usable during the mudperiod.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd east of Wiasma.\n\nStartzeit: 11:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 2500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109F-2\n\nWetterlage:\nStormy, rain changing with snow.\n
