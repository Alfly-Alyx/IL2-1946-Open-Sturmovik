Description \nZ. b. V. beim\nGeneral der Jagdflieger, Berlin\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nOktober 30th, 1942\n\n=============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe work of the Jaegerstab is showing first effects.\n\nThe Luftwaffe will change it's priorities to reflect the new defensive strategical concept of the OKW (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht / High Command of the Armed Forces).\nThe Luftwaffe fighters arm will be strengthened for the reduction of bombers. In production and development this new balancing will give more capacities for the fighters. Good news!\nEngland and Russia are building much more fighters than Germany today and the decision to enlarge the fighters arm was overdue for long.\n\nBut not only in numbers the situation grew negative and has to be reformed. Even the quality of the enemy fighters has become better and better. The development of the Bf-109 program went too slow and it can be estimated when our fighters will be inferior to the enemy types.\n\nAll this will have to be changed now.\nBoth main fighter programs, the Bf-109 and the Fw-190 program will get a lot more capacity in development. Allthough the technical level of the '109' gives only little room for further developments, it's production won't be given up in favour of the technical better Fw-190. Transforming the factories from building the '109' to building the '190' would cost a high decrease in fighter production numbers. \nFighters are needed more than ever before, so it is hoped that the '109' can be held 'fresh' by further development.\nThe Turbinenjaeger (jet fighter) once shall take over production capacities from the '109'. To make this possible it's development program will get more capacities with the highest level of priority.\n\nA new problem for the production is the order of the new government to release the many Russian forced labors from the war factories. The Geneva agreement shall be fulfilled and these Russian workers have to be brought to POW camps.\nA bad blow on our production. Like in England it is planned to compensate this loss in workers with women.\n\n\nAgain British bomber attacks have hit the Reich.\nIn the afternoon 32 targets were hit simultaniously. A formation of sixteen light Blenheim bombers attacked a target at Goerlitz ten minutes ago.\nAt about 19:40 Uhr the formation could be at Seelowe.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTake off and intercept the very low flying English bombers at Seelowe.\n\nStartzeit: Immediately\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Fw-190A-4\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny.\n
