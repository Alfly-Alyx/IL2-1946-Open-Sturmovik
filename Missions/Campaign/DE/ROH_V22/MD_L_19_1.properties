The Crisis has been overcome allthough the enemy still is beating into the German withdraw.\n\nIn the world press it is often said that the Wehrmacht is on the run. Of course you know that this is not true. But the first newspapers begin to speculate what will happen, when the withdraw of the Wehrmacht will have reached the old borders of Poland and the other Eastern European countries.\nWill Stalin stop then?\n\nNow it becomes more and more clear what the withdraw of the Wehrmacht can initiate on the political field.\nThe Western Powers will have to make a decision.\n\nWill they be willing to guarantee the former Eastern European borders when Stalin decides to follow the Wehrmacht until Germany will be reached?\nThe Polish Exile- Government is searching for the first contacts with Goerdeler.\n\nThe air war here in Russia is more and more changing to a fighter's war.\nFor you this kind of war is becoming dangerous. The Russians produce more and better planes than ever and better pilots, self confident and able are emerging under the Red Star.\n\n\nNot far from Ugra a major air battle is raging. The 1st Staffel is nearly completely involved. Both sides are sending more and more planes into the battle.\nMajor Ritter von Krohm has called you to jump into the fight.\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd northeast of Ugra.\n\n\nStartzeit: Immediately\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 2000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6\n\nWetterlage:\nRough winds, good visibility.\n\n\n
