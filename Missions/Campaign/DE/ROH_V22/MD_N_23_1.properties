Description \n\nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Kursk Nord\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nJune 18th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nFor ten days you couldnt fly. You suffered from a stomach complaint.\nSince the morning you fell well again.\n\nIn the meantime much happened:\nKursk is cut off. The 1st and 3rd Panzer Army passed the city eastwards and advanced to the south.\nThe Red Army has stopped it's advance southwards and began to send troops north to counter the Panzer Armies.\nAs it seems, 'Wallenstein' was a success allthough not so much enemy unit could be taken prisoner. However, the Red Army is in a very unorganized state at the moment. Our withdraw has got a little bit time.\n\nAt Kursk the Russians fought astonishingly effective with only a relive small force. The Red Army of 1943 has become a much harder to fight force than the Red Army of 1941. Even the Russian leadership has become much better. Together with the brave soldiers the Russian leadership managed to form a mighty battle force out of the Red Army.\n\nToday all Staffel and Gruppen- leaders were called to Stanowoje.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to the Fliegerhorst Stanowoje.\n\nStartzeit: After the arrival of the Group Leader\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6v\n\nWetterlage:\nFog, stormy.\n\n
