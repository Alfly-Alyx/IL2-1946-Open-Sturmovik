Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor\nRaum Balatonsee\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nFebruary 2nd, 1944\n\n===============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nToday you transfer back close to the front.\nYou recieved the five new Bf-109G-14. Additionally one of the Bf-109G-6As was changed for a new one. Only the old 'Black 2' made too much problems and finally a new machine was brought from Regensburg. If this plane will be as reliable as the 'Black 1' then the Bf-109G-10 will go into production.\nYour Staffel again has eightteen planes on hand and you will fly with the other two Staffeln of your Gruppe from Vespr\u00E9m.\n\nIn the south sector the battle is closing the decision.\nMarcali is still in the hands of the Americans and will be cut off in the next hours.\nNevertheless Bradley is optimistic.\nThe forward screens of the 17th Army were occasionally penetrated by the Soviets but the 17th Army reports that it has everything under control.\nIt becomes more and more clear that the enemy is getting serious problems. Allthough they are attacking permanently their forces are becoming weaker.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to your new Fliegerhorst.\n\nStartzeit: 11:30 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6/AS\n\nWetterlage:\nStormy.\n\n
