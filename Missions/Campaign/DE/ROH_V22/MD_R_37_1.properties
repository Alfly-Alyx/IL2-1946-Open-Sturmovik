At the moment delegations of the powers are on the way to Cyprus.\nIt still is unclear what happened in Moscow in the last days. The speculations are ranging up to a putsch.\n\nNow at least it is clear why the Soviet commanders at the front were like paralyzed when the allied forces went to the offensive.\nIt seems that the enemy commanders had no contact to their leadership in Moscow and didn't venture to decide a retreat.\n\nAt the conference the last night you recieved detailed orders how to act when a cease fire will be signed.\n\nAll commanders are ordered to stay on ground after the return to their airfields. \nYou are strictly forbidden to fly! \nYou must not go away more than 300 Meters from you office.\nEvery pilot of the Staffel is ordered to keep permanent radio contact with you.\nWhen you recieve the codeword 'Fruehlingswind' from the Luftflotte you must call back all eventually flying planes.\n\nAfter a short night at Szombathely you rolled to the runway together with your Gruppe comrades.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly back to Tapolca. Stay with your Geschwader leader Oberstleutnant Totenfeld.\n\n\nStartzeit: 08:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-14\n\nWetterlage:\nMorning haze, bad visibility.\n\n
