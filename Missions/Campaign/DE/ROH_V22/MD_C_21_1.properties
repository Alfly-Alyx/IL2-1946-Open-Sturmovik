Description \nLuftflotte 3 / Kanalk\u00FCste\nRaum Caen\n\nVersuchsjagdgruppe 8 (z.b.V.)\n\nJune 21st, 1943\n\n=======================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe world is going crazy!\n\nWhen you woke up in Warshaw at June 12th, you heard in the radio, that honest difficulties arose between Great Britain and France.\nWhen you arrived in Berlin in the evening of the same day the Air Forces of both countries met each other for an air battle over Le Havre.\n\nThe whole trouble arose, because the French had started to deliver raw materials to Germany which normally wanted to be hindered by the british blockade against Germany. In the afternoon of the 12th, a couple of british bombers bombed two ships in the port of Le Havre which were about to unload goods for Germany. \n\nOn the 14th the British attacked a french ship loaden with goods for Germany sailing to le Havre in the Channel. This time the british attempt to sink the ship was opposed by the Armee de L'air, the French Air Force. This time the French refused to withdraw. From a small engagement a fierce and large air battle arose which took more than three hours. Both sides had numerous losses. \n\nIn the following days british and french air units met each other over the french Normandy coast. Finally, at the 16th, the french Government asked Germany to deploy air units in northern France to assist in the defense of the coast. The Reich's government decided to send a Jagdgruppe to the Normandy.\n\nAt the 19th you were called to General Galland. You had a long talk with him and he told you that he had changed his plans with you. \nA big air operation against England will be conducted at the end of July. This help operation for France is just disturbing his preparations.\nUntil the beginning of his major operation against the Royal Air Force he wanted you to make some operational tests with a new plane type. Because he now has to organize the support for the french defense at the Normandy Channel coast, he wants that you combine the evaluation of the new planes with a support mission in France. \nIn other words: you will have to make the front evaluation with the new Bf-109Z hybrid heavy fighter in France against the Royal Air Force!\n\nYou were given time for the mission until the middle of july. Then you will have to come back to the VJGr.8, to train your comrades on the new Me-262 jet fighter for the upcoming major air operation.\n\nIn three days, at June, 25th, the IInd Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 26 will arrive at Caen. On the same day you will recieve four of the new Bf-109Z twinmots at the airfield Saint Paul near the City of Vire.\nYour order is to test the survivability of the plane against the British bombers and especially against the Spitfire.\n\nThe French Arme\u00E8 de l'Air is equipped with a rude mixture of planes. Many outdated fighters are still in service. Two new types are just coming to the French fighter units. The Arme\u00E9 de l'Air has a hard stand against the British Spitfires.\nThe license production of the Fw-190A-4 in France is still underway and only about 65 planes of the type were delivered to the units so far. These combined with about 30 P-38J delivered from the USA are the only up to date fighters the French can put into action. All the other 150 fighters are old and outdated.\n\nIn the afternoon you reached the airfield Trouville / Saint Gatien. Here you were welcomed very warm and you was given a former british Gloster Gladiator for your travel to Vire / Saint Paul.\n\nA German Luftwaffe officer traveling in a british plane type to a french airfield into a battle against the Britains! What a world.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nYou're standing on the field and your engine ist just running. Roll to the runway and take off. Be careful! A swarm of Fw-190s is taking off too.Then fly to your new destinatination Vire / Saint Paul.\n\nStartzeit: ... redy to roll.\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: low\nEinsatzmuster: Gloster Gladiator\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny weather.\n
