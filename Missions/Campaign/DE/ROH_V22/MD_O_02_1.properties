Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nAugust 10th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nIt's a strange situation on the Crimean Island.\nBoth sides have one Corps each which only hardly can be supplied and one Corps each where the supplying makes no problems.\nOn the first spot the Soviets seem to have an advantage.\n\nA break out of the Romanian Corps from south isn't possible at the moment. It can only be supplied by air transports. Only enough to keep a state of defense.\n\nOn the other hand the Soviet Airborne Corps seems to suffer under great supply problems too. It's supplies has to be delivered over sea via Jewpatoria. As no major southeast - northwest road connection is existent, the supplying of the Airborne troops is complicated for our enemy too.\n\nSo both sides aren't able to act offensively at the moment.\n\nThe Romanian- German units have to await a strenghthening of the forces around Dschankoj and the Soviets are waiting for the arrival of their 72nd Corps from Kertsch.\n\nThe race has started.\nIn the meantime we have to keep the air supplies running. and the Soviets are fighting to keep their sea lanes open. The Luftwaffe now has to secure the transport flights and to attack the enemy shipping simultaneosly.\n\nYour main task is to escort the transport planes in these days.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nMeet the transport planes at waypoint 5 and escort them to Sewastopol.\n\n\nStartzeit: 01:45 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-6v/R1 w. drop tank\n\nWetterlage:\nClear night.\n\n\n
