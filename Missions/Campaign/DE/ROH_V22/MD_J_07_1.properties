Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nAugust 12th, 1942\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nKotluban still couldn't be reached.\nThe advance to the east is makeing better progress.\nThis night Guderian will launch another major thrust to the south.\n\nKleist's 1st Panzer Group has launched his attack too and is advancing to the northeast.\nIt seems that the enemy had to withdraw forces from his southern defense line to strengthen his northern operations. So Kleist's attack met a relative weak defense which is obviously not able to hold on his attack.\n\nIn the meantime our air reconnaissance reports that the Soviets have begun to build fortifications in Stalingrad. Now it becomes more than ever important to cut off the city quickly.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd along the front line.\n\nStartzeit: 16:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-2\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny, light dust, average visibility.\n\n\n\n
