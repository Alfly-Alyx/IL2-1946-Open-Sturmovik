Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nOktober 6th, 1941\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n---------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe war in Russia is making very good progress.\nEverybody is impressed by the achievemntes of the Wehrmacht in this huge country. Many think that the Red Army will be beaten soon.\n\nAllthough the Wehrmacht achieved great victories the war is much harder than foreseen. The Russian soldiers are fighting stubborn even at the worst circumstances. Cut off units often refuse to give up and then have to be wiped out by force. The Soviets are willing to take huge losses. This behaviour inflicts also greater losses on the German Army. And while the Soviets seem to be able to fill their rows again and again, men and material on the German side is becoming weaker.\nEven on an individual level the Russian soldier is of unknown quality.\nOnce titled as 'Untermenschen' the Russian soldier shows his will to fight, to resist and his abilities to make the most out of terrain.\n\nThe Red Army is not as good lead as the Wehrmacht. This inflicts the bulk of it's huge losses. But the individual Russian soldier is able to make the Germans a hard stand. His well designed and easy to use weapons were a bad surprise for our soldiers. The Russian T- 34 tank can only hardly be stopped. The silly underestimation of a people of chess- players once will take it's price.\n\nThe men at the front know: the Russian Hydra is far from beeing beaten. The winter is coming. \nNow Hitler wants Moscow!\n\n\nAll your comrades are back from their holidays. The Staffel is at full strength again. It consists of 16 machines. Ten Bf-109 are from the F-2 type, four are Emils, mainly for fighter bomber missions and two are of the new F-4 version. From now on you got your own plane: a Bf-109F-2 with the identification number 3 on the fuseledge.\n\nYour new destinction is the Wiasma area. The last step on the main route to Moscow.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nLand at your new airfield at Ugra.\n\nStartzeit: ... on the way ...  09:07\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109E-7/B\n\nWetterlage: Cloudy, stormy, cold.\n
