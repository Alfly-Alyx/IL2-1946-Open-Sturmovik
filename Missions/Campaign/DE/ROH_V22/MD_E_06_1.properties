Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor,\nHalbinsel Krim\n\nIII. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nNovember 4th, 1941\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nYesterday flight operations were hindered by rain, bad visibility and the muddy runways. Since the night the weather cleared up.\n\nFrom all planes of the Jagdgruppen (fighter wings) only 30 to 50 percent are operational due to the conditions. That's why you will fly an Emil, until your plane is ready again.\n\nSo far, the Soviets weren't able to organize a coordinated defense. Our XXXIInd army corps was able to take Feososia. The LIVth army corps reached on both sides of Duwankoy the northern shore of the Belbeck river.\nToday a spearhead unit of the 72nd infantry division will try to take Aloushta in the central sector. If this could be achieved, the Soviet forces on the Crimean Island would be divided into two parts.\n\nYou are ordered to support this attempt with JaBo- attacks and then you have to secure a Stuka- attack against enemy fighters.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nAttack enemy units in Aloushta. Keep the area clear of enemy fighters until the Stukas have made their attack.\n\nStartzeit: 04:45\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109E-7/B, 4 x 50Kg Bomben\n\nWetterlage:\nHaze, but drying. Average visibility, fresh winds.\n\n
