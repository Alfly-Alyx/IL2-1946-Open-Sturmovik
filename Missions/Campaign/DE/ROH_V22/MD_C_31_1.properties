Description \nLuftflotte 3 / Kanalk\u00FCste\nRaum Caen\n\nVersuchsjagdgruppe 8 (z.b.V.)\n\nJuly 5th, 1943\n\n=======================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nYour evaluation mission of the Bf-109Z is coming to an end.\nTwo of the planes are so hardly damaged that they have to be transported back to the Reich by train.\n\nYou are ordered to leave France in four days. The preparations for the upcoming major operation against the English bombers have to be started soon. General Galland wants you to teach your pilots flying the Me-262.\nOther than the Bf-109Z the Me-262 shall be the plane of the future. How will it perform in action? It is much better designed than the 'Z'. It's clear that Professor Messerschmitt's heart went into the jet fighter.\n\nThe USA are making pressure on England to stop the air war against France. Sooner or later the Britains will have to stop their attacks on France or they will loose their support from the Americans. The German retreat from Russia is running. The day will come when the Western Powers will have to make a decision for one of the two.\n\nDuring the night a British Battleship squadron sailed from the nortwest into the direction of Le Havre. In the morning the ships were reconnaissanced 60 Kilometers west of the city. An air attack by french light bombers failed to hit the ships. Now the Arme\u00E9 de L'Air wants to conduct a second attack with Focke Wulf as fighter bombers. The Jagdgeschwader 26 will fly fighter escort for the French fighter bombers. \nWhen you heard of the plan you decided to to load bombs under your two left Bf-109Zs and give it  a try as a fighter bomber.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTake off and fly together with the French Fw-190s to the ship squadron. Attack one of the ships with bombs.\nThe French will arrive over your field at every moment.\n\nStartzeit: 05:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1500 meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109Z\n\nWetterlage:\nEarly morning, sunny.\n
