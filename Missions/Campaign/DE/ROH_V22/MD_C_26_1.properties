Description \nLuftflotte 3 / Kanalk\u00FCste\nRaum Caen\n\nVersuchsjagdgruppe 8 (z.b.V.)\n\nJune 28th, 1943\n\n=======================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nYour first impressions of the Bf-109Z in combat is twofold: \nLike some other developments from Professor Messerschmitt it's an 'ill' construction. A really bad sight to the right and an often too ineffective elevator, a landing gear which only can be called a 'slight help' to bring the bird in one peace to the ground, compared with sheer power and a deadly weaponry which can't be found at any other plane in these days.\nThe whole thing is a provisorium. The 'Z' is going in some manners into right direction but it's not 'ready'. \nIt's flaws could make you crazy but when you're riding it, the 'Z' can give you a feeling of beeing the god of death.\nKeeping it fast- and that's not really difficult, makes you nearly untouchable. Manouvering it takes the whole man. As it's pilot you fear it, more than any other plane you flew so far. But if you make the 'contract' with it, it pays back real satisfaction.\nThe Bf-109 'Z' won't go into mass production, that's for sure but when you, one day, won't fly it any longer you know that you will miss it.\n\nYou got a call:\nFive minutes ago a small formation of bombers was sighted over the channel coast. Suddenly at Valogne it turned to the southeast, heading to Caen.\nIt's obvious that the airfield Carpiquet is their target, where the IInd Gruppe /Jagdgeschwader 26 is operating.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTake off immediately and attack the enemy bombers.\n\nStartzeit: immediately\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109Z\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny afternoon.\n
