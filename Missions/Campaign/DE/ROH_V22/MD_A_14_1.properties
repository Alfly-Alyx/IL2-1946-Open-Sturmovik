Description \nZ. b. V. beim\nGeneral der Jagdflieger, Berlin\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 'Pik As'\n\nAugust 1st, 1943\n\n=============================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe attacks of the last three days cost the RAF great losses.\nWithin these few days they lost more than 400 bombers. The jetfighters destroyed more than 210 bombers mostly just before the coast of the Reich was reached.\n\nIn the evening the British bombers got up again.\nThis time they formed up not over South England, the Channel or the North Sea. This time they formed up far in the North, out of range of our jet fighters.\nSince yesterday evening the air battle is raging over the coastline and over the Reich. Again the British bombers were hit hard.\n\nThe Me-262 jet fighter has been proved as the perfect instrument against heavy bombers. It's high top speed and it's heavy weaponry is perfectly suited to attack bombers with relatively low risk. But it needs a good pilot. The time to aim and shoot are very short and many 'green' pilots aren't able to hit with it. Only very well trained pilots are able to keep the speed high and hit the target from low distance in a short snapshot. \n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nIntercept a formation of 20 to 30 bombers. The formation is flying home from south with course north, to Frankfurt an der Oder at 6000 meters altitude.\n\nStartzeit: 04:10 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 7500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Me-262A-1\n\nWetterlage:\nSunrise.\n\n\n
