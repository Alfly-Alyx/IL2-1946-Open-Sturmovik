Description \nJagdfliegerschule Beerfelde\nbei Berlin\n\nJune 2nd, 1941\n\n====================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nTomorrow your training ends here in Beerfelde. Then you will be informed where to you are transfered to.\nAllthough you have flown less hours on the '109' than your comrades, your superiors are very satisfied with your achievements.\nYou have gained a very good kill ratio with the camera. Your past as a test pilot is clearly visible. You were asked to stay at  the school to become a teacher. Nothin for you!\n\nThe training flights against the I-16 have shocked you and your comrades. The Russian plane looks ruggish and slow and everybody underestimated it. Full of self confidence you went into the fight only to realize that your teacher managed to put you into the defense.\nThe rules of fighter tactics must not be forgotten when engaging the I-16.\nDispite it's old fashioned look the I-16 has to be treated as a dangerous opponent. If you go with your '109' into a dogfight with it you are easy meat.\nThe key is to keep your energy niveau higher than that of your opposing I-16.\n\nYour comrades and you are lucky that you had the opportunity to learn this lesson against your teacher and not against a Russian fighter pilot.\n\nToday you can gain expieriences against another Soviet fighter type, the MiG-3.\nWith this plane it is roughly the same as with the I-16.\nDon't curve with it. Keep your energy level higher than your opponent. Use your '109' at it's best. Don't underestimate the Russian plane.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nDogfight training against the MiG-3 at wayponts 3 and 4\n\nStartzeit: 10:00 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 1000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109E-7/B\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny.\n
