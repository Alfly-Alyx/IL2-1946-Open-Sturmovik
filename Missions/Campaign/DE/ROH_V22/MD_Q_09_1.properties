Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nNovember 30th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe Soviet attack on your airfield failed totally!\n\nOnly one Soviet plane wasn't shot down.\nOn your side only two Bf-109 and two P-47 were lost. The Radar installations placed along the front make surprise attacks on airfields nearly impossible.\n\nLike your Staffel the  American comrades were very successfull. Six enemy planes were shot down by them. Good to see that the German and American pilots are growing together. Many missions are flown together. \n\nOn the ground the war is going bad.\nThe Red Army succeeded in overwhelming our defense line at Sudowaija- Wischnija. Now they will be able to make contact with the airborne units.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFreie Jagd\n\nStartzeit: 16:15 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 3000 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109G-14\n\nWetterlage:\nLight haze.\n
