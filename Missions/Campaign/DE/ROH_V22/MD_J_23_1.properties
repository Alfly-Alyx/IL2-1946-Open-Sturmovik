Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor\nRaum Stalingrad\n\nIII. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nSeptember 11th, 1942\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nAt the 9th, the airfield at Leninsk was taken by our ground troops.\nTwo Yaks and one American Bell fighter were found. \nIt seems that the Bell could be relative easy repaired. \nAfter the occurance of the Curtiss in Africa and here on the Eastern Front the Bell is the second fighter type the USA have exported to the Soviets.\nUntil now none of these planes is in our hands and it seems that it is relatively new to the Russians too. Of course our technicians in the Reich would like to take a look at the Bell.\n\nYour order is to take some mechanics, fly with the 'Firlefanz' to Leninsk and look if they can repair the plane. If they will succeed you shall fly the Bell to safe place.\n\nThe airfield is lying closely to the frontline and the Soviet artillery is still active. Be careful: Stay low when you land. The Soviet air defense is still able to fire into your landing path if you are too high.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to Leninsk. Land there. Then roll to the left parking field where the captured planes are standing.\n\nStartzeit: 18:30\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: unter 500 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: He-111H-2\n\nWetterlage:\nStrong winds, average visibility.\n
