Description \nLuftflotte 4, S\u00FCdsektor\nHalbinsel Krim\n\nIII. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nJune 8th, 1942\n\n=========================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nSince some time you have heard rumors about a mountain airstrip northeast of Yalta. There a small garrison of Luftwaffe members are operating a radar to control the southern coastline. The place has become famous as one of the most beautiful spots on the whole crimean island.\n\nAn hour ago the Gruppenchef came to your Staffel with the 'Palazzo'.\nAs your Staffel is held back for refreshing and you don't have to fly any missions, it would be a nice idea to spend a night at the mountain airstrip. \n\nYour Chef wants you to fly to the place to have a look at it.\nBefore you land at the mountain airstrip, a bag with important papers has to be brought to the airfield between Sewastopol and Vilino.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to the airfield Sewastopol - Vilino. Land there. At the control tower somebody will take over the papers bag. \nThen take off again and land at the mountain airstrip.\n\n\nStartzeit: 08:50\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109E-7/B\n\nWetterlage:\nAverage winds, good visibility.\n
