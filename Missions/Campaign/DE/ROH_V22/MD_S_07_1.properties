Just at that night the first three Las were painted with Finnish colors and markings. Before sunrise especially trained pilots were brought to the island and in the morning of the 15th, these first three Las were ready for action.\nFinally this morning, the other four Las were ready too. In the next few days, two elswere captured La-5s will come to Lavansaari and then the Finnish fighter force will own an additional Staffel.\nRespect!\n\nThe situation could become dangerous.\nYesterday you got warnings from the Finnish Navy that a squadron of Soviet ships were made clear at Leningrad.  \nTen minutes ago the Garrison of Lavansaari was informed, that the ships have left the port of Leningrad during the night.\nThe Tirpitz left your Island yesterday.\nThe highest grade of readyness is ordered.\n\nFor you, the Luftflotte has another order:\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to the small island Suursaari. Land at the small airstrip in the south, catch up a person and bring him to Lavansaari.\n\n\nStartzeit: 03:30\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: 300 Meter\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-110G-2\n\nWetterlage:\nEarly morning sunrise.
