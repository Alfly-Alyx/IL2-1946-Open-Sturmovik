Description \nLuftflotte 2, Mittelsektor\nRaum Lemberg\n\nIV. Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nNovember 28th, 1943\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nThe front is the real school.\nWith all their self- confidence the young American pilots sought every fight possible. The result was twofold. They are really good trained men and know how to handle their machines. But with their strong feeling of superiority they unfortunately underestimated the Russians totally. And so some of them had to learn their lesson the hard way.\nPure carelessness cost the 82nd squadron five planes and two pilots in the first two days. The young Americans attacked whenever possible. No situation was unfavourable enough, they never tried to go out and allways attacked agressively. Whenever they were met by a Russian ace he made short process.\n\nBut the young men are good pilots and the Thunderbolt is a formidable plane. When you first saw the P-47 you instantly associated a 'fat pig'. But in the air at high altitude the Thunderbolt is real hammer. It's very fast and it's diving abilities are uncompared. A perfect plane to evade dangerous situations. But only if you try to evade. The cowboys never made attempts to evade! Those young cowboys stayed the fight and then some found their master. If the young pilots would have only made use of the Thunderbolt's strengths, no one man would have been lost. \nOn the third morning Major Dix cleared the situation. He lectured his cowboys in a way that you never saw and heared. Unbelievable! In only one hour he teared his wild bunch down to the ground and canalized their overpowering courage to tactics and discipline.\n\nBut you're optimistic. May they be wild, these cowboys are nonetheless good pilots and with their courage, agressiveness and with their good planes they will finally help to turn the tide.\nIn these first days they learned their lesson. Finally they gained a new sight on you and on the Russians. First they didn't believe the high victory numbers of the German and Russian aces but after these few days they gained respect and with it the discipline to be successfull. \nNow a few really great talents come in sight. Good that the 'Amis' are here and good that they are on your side.\n\n\nYou often talked with Major Dix and you learned eachother to know.\nOf course the idea to change the planes wasn't far away. Today is the day.\nDix will try the '109' and you will try the Thunderbolt.\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nTestflight with the Thunderbolt\n\nStartzeit: 16:45 Uhr\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: -\nEinsatzmuster: P-47D-10 Thunderbolt\n\nWetterlage:\nSunny but strong winds.\n\n\n\n
