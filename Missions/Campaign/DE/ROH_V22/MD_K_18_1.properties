Gruppe / Jagdgeschwader 53 "Pik As"\n\nDecember 7th, 1942\n\n================================\n\nEinsatzbesprechung:\n-----------------------------\n\nLage:\n\nOne long week without flying.\nThe bad wether made any attempts to fly missions impossible.\nStalingrad was encircled by the Soviets and nothing could be done by the Luftwaffe.\n\nThis morninga major briefing took place. \nSurprisingly the leading officers were not very concerned abaout the situation and the encircled troops. A major operation  is planned, called 'Operation Fallwind'. The weather shall clear up the next days and the Luftwaffe will have to play an important role in 'Fallwind'.\n\nThe operation is based upon the 1st Panzer Army which is awaited to be ready for the attack at the end of december. Until then the encircled forces have to be supplied by air transports.\n\nThe forces in the Stalingrad- pocket have the size of a reinforced Army Corps.\nFour and a half divisions counting nearly 62.000 men.\n\nAs it seems the Red Army isn't able to widen it's ring around the city. At the outside of the ring, the Wehrmacht has enough troops to hold the lines. With the help of Kleist's 1st Panzer Army, coming from the north a breaking off of the Soviet encirclement should be possible.\n\nNow the main target will be to supply the encircled Army Corps.\n\nWhen the briefing had ended you got the message that your friend, Feldwebel Eulenberg has been shot down and was enforced to make an emergency landing behind the enemy lines. Eulenberg's plane was seen crashlanded on a height where he couldn't be easyly reached by Soviet troops. His wingman said that he seemed to be unwounded and that it should be possible to rescue him. \nYou quickly took a look into the maps and decided at once to load a few men into the Group- Heinkel and rolled to the runway...\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\nFly to the height where Feldwebel Eulenberg has crash landed. Land there and pick him up. Fly very low through the river valleys to escape the strong enemy air defense.\n\nStartzeit: Immediately\nEinsatzh\u00F6he: Tiefstflug\nEinsatzmuster: He-111H-2\n\nWetterlage:\nStrong haze, sharp winds.\n\n\n\n
