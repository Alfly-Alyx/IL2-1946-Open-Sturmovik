Description \n\nType: Intercept\n\nDate: October 17 1941\n\nTime: 17:00 \n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nRussians are once again beginning to use heavy 4-engine bombers, like in the attack of Berlin in August. This aircraft is well armored and has great weapon protection against an attack from any direction. You have a better chance of damaging this aircraft from a low front attack where this plane has only one nose mounted turret with two machine guns of small caliber. You can also try to attack this plane in a vertical dive from above. In this case, the plane will have a dead zone to use its weapons. From the rear, you can expect defense from 4 turrets equipped with machine guns and 20 mm cannons! So try to avoid attempts of attacking from the rear.\n\n\nObjective:\n\nYour goal is to intercept and break up their bombarding of our troops' positions. The most likely area where you will find these bombers is specified on a map - over the city of Mozhaysk, which has just been seized by our army.\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\nPlayer Aircraft: Bf-109F-2\n
