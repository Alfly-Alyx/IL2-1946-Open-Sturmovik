Name Crimea mission 76
Description \n\nType: Patrol\n\nDate: April 25, 1944\n\nTime: 12:00 \n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nIt seems that soon someone will name us as Sea Wolfs. All too often we now only fly only sea. We have been ordered to support sea transport units. We will have constant patrol missions over the transport routes to prevent attacks from Soviet ships and torpedo boats.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe patrol area is specified on the map. Attack any target identified as enemy. However, if you meet big ships, I advise against attacking them. Your aircraft is a fighter, and not the bomber required for that special purpose.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPlayer Aircraft: Bf-109G-6 late
