The enemy is always flying, but why aren't we? \nOther groups of our fighters units reported that they have met a new type of Soviet fighter. It is probably the new Yak-7.  They often use rockets for aerial attacks. We know that once, a Soviet fighter equipped with such rockets destroyed 4 of our fighters with only one shot from a great distance This rocket's level of destruction is equal to a direct hit with an 88 mm shell!\n\nObjective:\n\nYour flight is in the direction of the city of Vyasma. If you encounter Soviet fighters armed with rockets, be very careful and use any maneuver possible to avoid the rocket attack before destroying the enemy. \n\nGood Luck!\n\nPlayer Aircraft: Bf-109F-2
