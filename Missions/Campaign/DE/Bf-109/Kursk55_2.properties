Name Kursk mission 1
Description \n\nType: Free hunt\n\nDate: July 5, 1943\n\nTime: 9:00 \n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nI hope you all now feel good and ready for new great battles! \nGerman armies have prepared an offensive in the Belgorod - Kursk - Orel sector. This battle is capable of changing the course of the war!  An operation called "Citadel" was scheduled to begin early this morning, but the Russians have taken counter-measures and attacked our positions and airfields 10-15 km behind the front line. The attack was unexpected and we have suffered serious losses among armored troops and artillery.  However, the offensive of the 18th Panzer and 10th Divisions is already underway. Our troops need fighter cover over the whole sector near Maloarkhangelsk.\n\nWe expect new attacks from bombers.  The attack of our airfield is not excluded either. Our observers have informed us of about 1000 Soviet aircraft flights through the front line in the first hour\n\nObjective:\n\nOur main goal is to find and destroy the Russian bombers. We will fight in cooperation with the Hungarian fighter group "Puma".  Initial waypoints and the area of our action are specified on the map. Please do not deviate from your course of flight unless absolutely necessary. Our observers have told us that it is in this sector that the flights of Soviet bombers are seen most frequently.\n\n\nGood luck!\n\nPlayer Aircraft: Bf-109G-6
