Name Kuban mission 61
Description \n\nType: Intercept\n\nDate: September 3, 1943\n\nTime: 3:30 \n\nWeather: poor\n\nDescription:\n\nOur troops are now in difficult situation. It seems that the Russians have increased activity in several directions to develop a new offensive on Kuban. High Command thinks it is possible to stop them. \nOne of the awful things that our troops now fear are the constant night attacks of Night Witches. These biplanes bring us the great night terror. They make our soldiers nervous, they dont sleep and as a result, resistance of our troops to Russian attacks in this sector of the front has decreased noticeably. \n\n\nObjective:\n\nYour goal is to try to intercept these biplanes tonight to stop their unpunished attacks on the Novorossiysk port. \n\nGood luck!\n\nPlayer Aircraft: Bf-109G-6
