Description \n\nType: Escort\n\nDate: August 21 1942\n\nTime: 5:00 \n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nIt's good to see you back in Russia and in our Staffel again! No doubt you'll tell us later how things are in the West, but for now we have a real job on our hands. We have just begun a new offensive. The main target is now Stalingrad! Our armies have just forced the Dnieper river and developed a wide offensive on the whole front. They need strong support from the air!  Unfortunately we must use an unprepared airfield, but I'm sure we'll soon move to another airfield. Also, we will soon receive new fighters - the Bf-109G-2!\n\n\nObjective:\n\nEscort the bombers to the area around the Stepnoy Russian airfield.  You may meet Russian bombers, but remember the main goal of the mission - the escort!  Watch out for the enemy fighters!\n\n\nGood Luck!\n\nPlayer Aircraft: Bf-109F-2
