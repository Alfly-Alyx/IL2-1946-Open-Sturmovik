Description The enemy raid took us quite unprepared.\n\nOKL (Oberkommando der Luftwaffe) has also received clearance from Berlin to station more AAA batteries in this area.\nThis cannot of course happen in one day, and even when evrything will be in place, we still cannot count only on that for the defence of the Factories.\n\nThis morning, a supply ship convoy on its way to Rostock has sighted what they reported as a Sunderland, probably.\nIf they are correct, the British might try to send some torpedo Fairey Battle in and destroy it.\n\nWe cannot afford to loose more good materials, ships or crews.\n\nTherefore, you will take your flight out to escort the convoy until extra naval escorts arrive to relieve you.\n\nA flight of Bf109s will join you in the area.\n\nKeep your eyes open and don't allow any enemy plane to harm the ships.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
