Description That was not a good show. Almost half of the supplies were destroyed on the ground. The production lines had to slow down, while we desperately need those planes to replenish the squadrons on the Eastern Front.\n\nIt has become clear that the British are going to intensify their raids against the Factories.\nFortunately, this has also been recognized by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (OKL) which decided to station 2 more Squadrons in the area.\n\nFrom now on, a Squadron of Bf-109s will be stationed at the airfield just North of here, while a Squadron of Bf-110 fighter-bombers will be stationed at the airfield near the U-Boot-pens, NE of here.\n\nThey are arriving at their new fields today.\n\nGet up in the air with two flights and patrol the coast to avoid any surprises from those damned Tommies.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
