Description Our U-Boots are bringing havoc among the Allied convoys on the North Sea supply routes.\n\nRumors go that the Allies are preparing a bombing raid against the Rostock sub-pens. The sub-pens are far too deep into our territory, but the British might just be crazy enough to try a surprise raid from their bases in Denmark.\n\nThe weather is not excellent for a raid, but the Kriegsmarine Kommando has asked us to add the sub-pens into our routine patrol flights.\n\nThis is a good opportunity to give the two new rookies a bit of training. Take number 10 and 12 with you and patrol the area north of the sub-pens.\n\nYou might be lucky enough to spot an enemy recon plane coming too close to our coast.\n\nThe Illmarinen coastal defence ship will also be on patrol along the coast.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
