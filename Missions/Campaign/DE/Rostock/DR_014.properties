Description Last night's raid has caused only minor damage. Most of the bombs hit several unused office space and a couple of junk buildings mocked up as production lines, missing the real assembly lines by few yards.\n\nNonetheless, it was as if the enemy planes were quite aware of which part of the extensive industrial area to look for. This makes us suspect that spies are at work right under our noses.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine is sending out U-Boots to patrol the coast around the Warnow estuary, looking for enemy vessels on a rendez-vous to pick-up or drop British spies.\n\nTonight, your flight will be supporting such a patrol.\n\nThe planes have been equipped with bombs just in case the U-Boot stumbles upon an enemy vessel.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
