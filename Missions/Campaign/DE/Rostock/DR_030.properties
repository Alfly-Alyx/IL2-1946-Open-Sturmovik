Description Ah, Herr Hauptmann! I heard that this will be your last day with this Squadron.\n\nYour request for transfer to a front-line unit has been finally accepted. Your orders are to join your new Squadron within 72 hours.\nI heard that the spring has not yet arrived to Russia, so if I was you I would not give away your winter gear yet.\n\nI wish you good luck with your new assignment... you will need it.\n\nYour last mission will be to fly a patrol over the Factories.\n\nDuring the last raid, a British Wellington crashed on the coastal radar station and damaged the primary antennas array.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we are blind.\n\nThe engineers will have it operative for tonight, but in the meantime we are sending all we have on patrol.\n\nRumors go that the Tommies are coming back to finish what they started yesterday.\n\nNow move it.\n\nHals und beinbruch!\n\nSkin: He100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
