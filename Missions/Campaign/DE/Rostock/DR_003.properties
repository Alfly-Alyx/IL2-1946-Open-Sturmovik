Description Good work.\n\nThe submarine crew was back safe and sound. Luckily for them you were in the area when that Hurricane came around.\nIt is perhaps just a coincidence, but you're here just few hours and we have already seen more enemy activity around here than in the whole last three months.\n\nAnyways, a tow-boat is bringing the U-Boot back home.\nThey are already under way, but we fear the Hurricane might have spotted the U-Boot already and reported it to its base in Denmark.\n\nThe British would not take chances to come too close to the coast, since our defences are too strong, but they might be just in time to send an anti-sub plane to finish the job before the tow convoy is within the range of the coastal defences.\n\nFly over there and provide the Kriegsmarine with a bit of air cover.\n\nTake your wingman with you.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
