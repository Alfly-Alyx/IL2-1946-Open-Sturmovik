Description It has been rather calm since the raid to the sub-pens.\nFortunately, just a couple of U-Boots suffered some minor damage and were repaired on the spot.\n\nToday, some high Party functionaries are coming to visit the Heikel Factories.\nThey will land at the lake North of the city.\n\nSince your Squadron officially belongs to the Factory Defense Unit, we have been asked to provide escort for the last part of the flight.\n\nMeet the Ju-52 seaplane in sector Q25 and escort it with three other planes.\n\nI know you have made quite a few enemies in the Party, but try to keep your eyes open anyways, will you?\n\nThe plane is carrying also some engineers and designers, so do this at least for those civilians.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
