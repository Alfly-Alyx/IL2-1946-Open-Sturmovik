Description So... our spies in Denmark were right. The British were definitely up to something.\n\nTonight the weather is ideal for a night bombing. Enough clouds to hide in, but also large clearings to catch a glimpse of the target.\n\nA Fw-200 on a routine patrol has sighted some air activity near the coast of Denmark. It stayed far enough not to alarm the planes, but the crew was able to make out some flights of two-engines bombers, Wellingtons, very likely.\n\nWe know they are coming, but they still think they will catch us by surprise, so the advantage is on our side.\n\nGet up with eight planes and circle in the area just North of the sub-pens.\n\nSome Bf-110 night interceptors will also be in the area. Please don't shoot at any of our planes just because they have two engines as well, ok?\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
