Description So, the Forschungsamt was right about the plane.\n\nA patrolling S-Boot has captured the pilot of the Lysander and his passenger, together with a water-proof bag full of photo's of the tactical targets in the area.\nIt is unclear how much information the spy had already been able to pass on to the British before the extraction.\n\nTherefore, your squadron will be on a 24/7 alert from now on.\n\nThere is a supply train on its way to the Heinkel Factories and a transport convoy will be sent to distribute the wares to the Factories.\n\nIf the enemy tries something, we think their ingress point should be at the V25 quadrant.\n\nTherefore, you will take your flight and cover the area between the Factories and that sector.\nA flight of Bf-110s will keep an eye on sector X25, just in case.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
