Description The enemy boat failed its rendez-vous, but we think the British will still try to pick-up their spy in the next couple of days.\n\nThough the Kriegsmarine is on full alert for a pick-up by sea, our Forschungsamt (Luftwaffe Intelligence) supports the idea that this time the enemy will try a pick-up by air. Some of their observers have noticed a civilian car driving on the road between Kuhlungsborn (Angern on the map) and Wittenbeck (Tukkum on the map) a few times as if on survey.\n\nThere is a stretch of road long and straight enough to be used as landing strip. The place is near a large patch of forest, a perfect place to hide while waiting for a plane.\n\nThe weather tonight is ideal for a pick-up. As agreed, a Storch was on the look-out in the area.\n\nThe observer reported an unidentified plane flying in low. In order not to alarm the pick-up plane, the Storch has switched off the engine and has sailed away, clicking the radio three times to give the signal.\n\nFly to the area and be sure the enemy plane takes off undisturbed and then bring it down.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
