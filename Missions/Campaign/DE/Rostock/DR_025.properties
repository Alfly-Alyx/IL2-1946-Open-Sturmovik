Description The British Navy is becoming a nuisance by the day.\n\nThe OKK (Oberkommando Der Kriegsmarine) has ordered more mines being laid off the Baltic coast.\n\nThis morning, you will take two flights and will escort two Fw-200's on a mine laying mission.\n\nRemember that your He-100 will be very close to its maximum range.\nWe have equipped your aircrafts with external fuel tanks. It's likely you will need every drop to make it back home safely.\n\nThere are a couple of rookies in your flight and I hope they have been listening to your lessons on fuel management.\n\nHowever, don't let the fuel issue distract you from your escort duty.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
