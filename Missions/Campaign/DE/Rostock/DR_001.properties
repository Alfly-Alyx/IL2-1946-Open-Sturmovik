Description Good morning Herr Hauptmann! What a beautiful morning to fly.\n\nThe Tactical Officer has set out a nice flight pattern in order to give you an idea of your area of operations.\n\nThe first part is over the Heinkel Factories, on both banks of the river. Head then roughly North until you reach the coast, where the submarine pens are located.\n\nEvery now and then some silly British pilots try to get close to the area, so keep your eyes open.\n\nFor the rest: enjoy the scenery on this beautiful morning.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
