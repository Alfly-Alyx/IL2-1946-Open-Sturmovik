Description Alarm!\n\nA Storch has sighted three low flying bogeys looking very suspiciously like Blenheim bombers heading this way.\n\nThey are closing in fast.\n\nTheir target might be either the U-Boot pens or the radar station.\n\nEither way, get up with your flight and bring them down.\n\nThe weather is bad and this will make the interception more difficult, but those planes must be stopped at all costs.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
