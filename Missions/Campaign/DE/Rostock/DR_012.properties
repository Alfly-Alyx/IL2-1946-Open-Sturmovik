Description After a short period of relative calm, several recon planes have reported increasing activity in our sectors.\n\nThis early morning, a storch patrolling sector P31 has sighted some "low flying, two-engine bogeys". The pilot was short on fuel and had to return back to his base, so he could not confirm they were enemy planes.\n\nHowever, the Luftkommando for this area confirmed that none of our flights was supposed to be in that area.\n\nExtrapolations of the bogeys' guessed course make us think they are heading for the new coastal radar base at the estuary of the Warnow.\n\nThere's no point in sitting back and wait.\n\nTake two sections and patrol the area. Keep your eyes open.\n\nA flight of Bf-109's will be vectored to your sector from a nearby base.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He-100_1\nMarkings: OFF\n
