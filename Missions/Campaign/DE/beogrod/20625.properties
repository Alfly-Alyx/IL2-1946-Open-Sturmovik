Description We have defeated the Soviet winter offensive and are well placed to attack the weak forces remaining in front of us.  The first objective is Voronezh, but that is only to protect the flank of a drive towards the Soviet oil reserves in the Caucasus.  Our Hungarian and Italian allies are to supply additional forces, as much of the Wehrmacht remains to defend the salient in front of Moscow.
