Name April 3/4 1945 Mosquitos inbound for Berlin
Short \u0020Bad weather tonight but radar reports aircraft on a probable course for Berlin. You will need to meet them\n
Description \u0020The night of April 3/4 1945. The outlook is grim for Germany. Only the fools and madmen cant see the end. The Americans are beginning to make their final offensive in Italy. The Russians are charging towards Berlin from the East and the Americans, British and other Allied forces are closing from the West. There is very little fuel for operations and spare parts are hard to get let alone replacement aircraft. Very few of the old pilots have survived. A handful of veterans and barely trained boys are all that is left. Despite these overwhelming odds, the pilots of the Luftwaffe are still attempting brave resistance with what they have on hand. There is no rest. British aircraft are again headed for Berlin. You will only have 1/2 a tank of fuel when you rise to meet them. You will again go aloft in the Me262. Be very careful of the plane in this weather. Thunderstorms are predicted for tonight with clouds at 1500. Take off at 1.30 and proceed to Berlin where your patrol altitude will be 4000m. Do your best to intercept the enemy but be very cautious in your flight. The highest goal for this evening is to bring yourself and your plane back in one piece.\n
