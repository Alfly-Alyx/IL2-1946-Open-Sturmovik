Name \u0020Transfer to NJG 11 "Kommando Welter"
Short \u0020March 1945 You have been chosen to be a part of "Kommando Welter", part of NJG11. You will be one of a few select pilots that will fly the new Me262 in night combat.\n
Description \u0020On January 2nd 1945 Oberleutnant Kurt Welters flew an unauthorized night mission in the new Me262 fighter in the dark skies over Berlin. That night he shot five RAF Mosquitos down. In the city below, Reichsmarschall Goering was watching the the bombers go down in flames. Welter was called before the Reichsmarschall the next day. Fearing the worst, as his flight was unauthorized, he was instead greeted as a hero. In their meeting Welters expressed his wish to create a unit of Me262 nightfighters and his wish was granted. Due to shortages of planes and pilots, Welters new unit "Kommando Welters", part of NJG11, had a slow start. He himself kept busy in the 262 over Germany's night skies.\nYour success and skill as a Wilde Sau night fighter pilot have landed you a job in the newly formed unit. Unfortunately you will have little time to make the transition to the new aircraft but you are experienced and confident. You will have a chance to get one flight in today at dusk and then this evening you must be prepared for night combat in the 262. As the new 262 is most vunerable during takeoff and landing, you will have four FW190 Doras to cover you during your check flight. Takeoff time is 17.20 Circle around the airfield heading west at approximately 900m. and try a few manoevers to get a feel for the plane. Make sure to leave plenty of space for your landing approach.\n
