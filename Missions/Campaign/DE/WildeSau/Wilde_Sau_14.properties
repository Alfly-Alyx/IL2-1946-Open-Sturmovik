Name Mid April 1945 Moving to new base
Short \u0020April 1945. Your large base is no longer safe. You must move to a smaller field south of Berlin where your jet can be hidden among the trees\n
Description \u0020Mid April 1945. A cold wet spring. Your base is no longer safe. All German airspace is now fully in control of the Allies. Any and all aircraft left in the open are easy prey for the swarms of American, British and Russian on constant patrol. You will have just enough fuel in your 262 to fly to the West to a much smaller airbase south of Berlin. There is a nice stand of forest next to the runway and the remaining aircraft have been hidden in the woods. This will be a very dangerous flight. You will have two Fw190 Ds in the air to cover for you as you take off. Fly immediately to your new field and get theaircraft under cover. If any enemy aircraft should appear, your focus must be on the survival of your aircraft. Let your escort take on any opposition. As soon as your on the ground, taxi for the trees and look for an open spot to park on the easternmost side of the forest. There is a clearing ready for you and a Kettenkrad waiting to help pull your 262 into the trees. Take off directly at 9.45 heading west southwest to the field near Sperenberg and keep your plane at a low (500m) altitude beneath the cloud deck. Rain is forecast all day today.\n
