Name \u0020Aug 17/18 1943
Short \u0020August 17/18 1943 British bombers attack Peenemunde V weapons site north of Berlin.\n
Description \u0020August 17/18 1943. This evening you and your wingman got a late start. The rest of your flight took off to respond to a small raid over Berlin. Most likely the planes were Mosquitos acting as pathfinders for an oncoming larger raid of four motor bombers. It is now obvious that the raid on Berlin was just a decoy attack and there are reports of large bomber formations to the northeast of Berlin. The previous flight will not be able to give chase to the large bomber formation as they have used up their fuel circling Berlin and waiting for bombrs that never showed up. As you and your wingman got a late start, you will be heading to the northeast to try to intercept the main bomber stream. The original report stated the bombers were at 6000 meters but anti aircraft spotters think the planes are much lower than that. You and your wingman will do your best to find the raiders\n
