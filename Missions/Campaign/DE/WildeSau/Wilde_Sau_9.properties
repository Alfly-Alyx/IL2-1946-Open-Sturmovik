Name \u0020May 5th, 1944 On patrol.
Short \u0020There have been occasional single weather or pathfinder aircraft coming in ahead of the bombers. You will fly a circuit of Berlin hunting for intruders.\n
Description \u0020Early morning. May 5th 1944. We have had little luck downing single, low flying pathfinder aircraft as they come over the city before the main force of bombers arrives. Tonight you will be on the hunt flying a circuit around the city of Berlin lying in wait for these aircraft should they decide to pay us a visit this evening. Begin your flight at 2000m. and stay tuned to the radio for any messages from ground control. Take care upon your return. The weather officer has reported thick cloud cover moving in from the south west.\n
