Name July 1st 1943
Short July 1st 1943 Quick night flying training mission.\n
Description July 1st 1943. Your successes as a fighter pilot on the Eastern front have made quite an impression on your superiors. You have been pulled from your unit and asked to volunteer to return to Germany to be a part of a special new unit that will be using new tactics against the ever increasing night time bomber attacks on Germany.  Former bomber pilot, Hajo Hermann has some tactical ideas that might be able to improve our chances of downing enemy aircraft at night. While you have flown some missions in low light conditions you will need to become more familiar with flying only by instruments in the dark. Tonight you will have an easy mission. You will need to fly a short circuit of your home airfield to re-familiarize yourself with instrument flying. Take off time is at 23:30. You will begin by taking off to the east and then heading west, taking a parallel leg to the north of the airfield reaching a maximum altitude of 700m. Bring your machine back in for landing, allowing plenty of time to set up your approach. See you when you return!\n
