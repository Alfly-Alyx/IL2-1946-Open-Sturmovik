Name December 24th 1943
Short \u0020Christmas Eve day 1943.\n
Description \u0020December 24th, 1943. Today is Christmas Eve but unfortunately there is little to celebrate today. The mechanics have made a small attempt to enjoy the day by cutting a small pine tree and decorating it with ornaments made from metal food containers that have been nicely fashioned into stars. As the Americans continue to step up their daylight raids the Wilde Sau units begin to be called away more often from their nocturnal prowlings to take on the massive armadas on B 17s. Day fighter groups are stretched to their limits and need all the help they can get. American bombers are incoming and your nightfighter unit must rise to meet them. You've been armed with rockets. Two Me210s will also be joining you on this intercept. You will be flying a FW190 A5 for this mission. Climb to 3000m and organize your attack. Remember to use a head on attack against these planes after you have launched your Wfr.Gr.21rockets.\n
