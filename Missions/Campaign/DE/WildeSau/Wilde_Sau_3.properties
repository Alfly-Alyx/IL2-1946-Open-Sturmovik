Short While you have been perpared for night fighting, an incoming raid of B-17 bombers must be engaged.\n
Description The experiment of "Wilde Sau" tactics was a success on the night of July 3/4th. Nine out of ten fighters returned home and twelve British bombers were shot down. Goring has now given Hermann a whole Geschwader of Wilde Sau pilots and the new unit will be designated JG 300.\nToday, July 6th 1943 you have been studying maps and working on tactical ideas for the upcoming night campaign you will be a part of when the air raid sirens went off. A message has just come in that a large group of American B-17s are headed this way.\nAlthough your unit is now officially designated as a nightfighter geschwader,You will be pulled away from your night fighting duties today in this emergency to get aboard a FW190 to intercept the bombers. Head to the northwest and climb to 4000m. The daytime fighters who have had experience with these Jabos say that a head on attack is the best method to deal with these large, well armed planes. Avoid attacking from the 6 o clock position.\n
