Name \u0020The final days..............
Short \u0020Late April 1945. Intercept incoming allied fighter bombers\n
Description Late April, 1945.You barely made it to your new base where what few planes that remain of the Luftwaffe are reduced to hiding in the trees to avoid almost certain destruction by constantly marauding Allied aircraft. This morning at 7.45 a report was recieved telling of fighter bombers heading towards your field. You and one other Me262 will take off directly to meet the fighters. There are four FW190 Doras flying cover for you as you take off. When you are up in the air, proceed to 1000m to intercept the enemy aircraft. IMPORTANT! You will find yourself in your 262 with engines already started. Make sure the throttles are cut all the way down. You will need then to taxi carefully out of your hiding place in the trees and proceed to the western side of the runway to get in place to take off. Use the rudder and careful throttling of starboard a or port engines to steer yourself out of the trees and over to the runway.\n
