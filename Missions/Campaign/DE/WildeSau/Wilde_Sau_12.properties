Name \u0020March 1945 First combat mission in Me262
Short \u0020After a quick test flight you find yourself ready for your first combat flight in the Me262.\n
Description \u0020Today you had a chance to familiarize yourself with the cockpit layout of the Me 262 for a few hours and then actually take it up for a flight to get a feel of the plane. Welters has said hunting the Mosquitos is "easy" in this new jet. Having enough speed to overtake the Brits is certainly not a problem and on good nights the RAF aircraft are fairly visible from above or reflecting the fires and searchlights from below. Your unit has also recieved a some of the 262s with cockpits for two although these have not been used in combat, they are good for getting new pilots ready to go in the Schwalbe. Mosquitos are again inbound for Berlin. You will be working alone again tonight. Weather is reported this evening as continuing poor with clouds at 1000m. After take off at 23.45, fly immediately to Berlin at a patrol altitude of 4200m and begin your search.\n
