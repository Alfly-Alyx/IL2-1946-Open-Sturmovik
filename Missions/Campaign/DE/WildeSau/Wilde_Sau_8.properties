Short \u0020March 24/25th 1944 British bombers inbound for Berlin\n
Description \u0020The weather is extremely poor this evening and you were hoping against hope that you would not have to fly tonight. A person has only so much luck but yet another large raid of British bombers is headed to our capitol city of Berlin. As many nightfighters as possible will be sent up this evening. Head out through the rain to get in ito your Bf109. The "black men" have already started it up. You will have company from another group of FW 190A5 which will also be vectored in on the raiders. Tonight you must attack the bombers but you will have to take care to return safely Good luck! There will be some real coffee waiting for you upon your return. The weathermen report the rain will continue through the night. Take off time is 1.30. Climb to a 2900m patrol altitude over the city of Berlin and begin your hunt.\n
