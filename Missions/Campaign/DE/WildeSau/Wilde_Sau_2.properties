Name The night of July 3/4 1943
Short \u0020The night of July 3/4 1943 Testing the theory.....\n
Description \u0020The night of July 3/4 1943. Major Hajo Hermann's ideas will be put to the test this evening. In late May, Hermann was allowed an audience with Hermann Goring, He described his idea that small fast fighters such as the Bf 109s and FW 190s used in day actions be used against night bombers in flak free zones. The fighters acting singly could use searchlights, lights on the ground and ground based radar to search out and destroy nocturnal bombers without the worry of friendly flak shooting at every aircraft in the sky. Goring approved and allowed for the creation of a special unit equiped with 109s and 190s to try out the new tactics. This evening, radar has been tracking incoming enemy contacts. They are most likely British bombers. Estimated altitude of the incoming planes is 3000m. Since you have shown such excellent aptitude with your night flying skills, you will be one of the few pilots to go out and see if Hermann's ideas have any potential. You will take off at 23.15 and head to the northwest where you will be vectored to meet the bombers. Your will climb to your patrol altitude of 3000m and begin searching for enemy bombers.  We will expect a detailed report of your observations when you return.\n
