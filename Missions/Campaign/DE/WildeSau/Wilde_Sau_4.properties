Name July 29/30th 1943
Short \u0020July 29/30th 1943 Bombers bound for Hamburg\n
Description \u0020July 29/30th 1943. A large number of British Stirling, Halifax, Wellington and Lancaster bombers are headed east northeast at approx. 3000m  for the city of Hamburg this evening. There has been a proposal to change "Wilde Sau" tactics and leave the restrictions of the "Himmelbett" system of radio beacons to allow fighters to move freely among the bomber stream. You will be on your own this evening but there will be another friendly aircraft (FW190) engaged in your general patrol area. The weather tonight is poor with a cloud deck at 1500. After takeoff, head to the northwest and once at an altitude of 3000m over the city, begin your search for the bombers.\n
