Short \u0020October 23/24, 1944 Mosquito intercept over Berlin. 38 RAF Mosquito fighterbombers were sent to Berlin on this night.\n
Description \u0020October 23/24th 1944. The RAF have continued to send groups of the small, fast Mosquito fighter bombers over Berlin. To catch them we need to be informed of their approach, take off and get above them and hope they are caught by the searchlights. If you can not be at altitude when the Mosquitos arrive, they are too fast to catch up to. Radar spotters have just called in a new contact and they are most likely Mosquitos. You will be on post alone tonight on your hunt for the fighter bombers. The night is clear so that should be a help. (The often poor weather has taken quite a toll on the younger, less experienced pilots when they try to find and then land in the rain or fog) Take off is at 23.15. After you are airborne, circle south of the airfield and then proceed north over Berlin to a patrol altitude of 4000m.\n
