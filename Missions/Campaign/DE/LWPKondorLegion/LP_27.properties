Name LP27
Short Combat Air patrol over the Ebro plus escort ground pounders\n
Description July 1938\nSpain\n0610hrs\n\nAchtung meine Herren! \n\nYour work this morning was effective but there remains a lot more to do. The Republicans Army of the Ebro overran  the nearest town, our main point of resistance. There are still a few pockets holding out but in the main, the battle for the town is over. \nThrough determined effort,our forces were able to hold on in the village to the east. \nThat is the new centre of this battle.\n\nOur ground attack planes will be supporting the ground troops but there will no doubt be Republican fighters. We have requested that the new "Stuka" units be assigned here but high command is still not convinced that this is the main thrust of the Republican offensive. If this is a diversion, it certainly is convincing!\n\nYour mission is to patrol the battle-zone at 3000m and neutralise the effects of the Communist fighter planes so that our ground-attack crews can do their job. God knows they'll need the help today.But don't risk your own skin too much - we need every plane and pilot we can get!!!\n\nHeil Hitler!\n\n\n \n=====================\nAircraft: BF-109E4/B\nPaintscheme:  \n$01-SCW-6-119-bis-LegionCondor5.bmp\n(Markings OFF)\n\n\n
