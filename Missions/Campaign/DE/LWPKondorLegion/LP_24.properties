Description Italian Reconaissance Airfield,\nOff the coast of North Africa,\nLate June, 1938\n1134hrs\n\nWelcome to our little island hideaway, Herr Jedermann. As our liason officer probably told you yesterday, we are charged with monitoring the Frenchies actions, particularly any fleet movements. It is a fairly quiet sector to say the least so you should get a chance to work on your tan and get some more hours in in the G.50. \n\nTo liven things up  though we have set up a reconaissance mission for you. Nothing earth-shattering I'm afraid but it should be a nice opportunity for you to stretch your flying muscles. \n\nWe know that there are a couple of French naval vessels in the area.  They're anchored off-shore to the east of what passes for a major town in this part of the world. Your mission is to fly over and grab some pictures.\nIt's a pretty routine mission for this base and will be a good familiarisation flight for you.\n\nTo avoid detection for as long as possible go in at sea-level. Your route will take you down the western side of the mountains in order to avoid detection s they watch the seaward approaches closely. Turn east about halfway along the mountain range and hug the terrain through the mountains.You will approach the French ships from the south and at wave-top height. Srprise should be complete. They'll never see you coming and you'll be safely away before they have had a chance to react.\n\nIn the unlikely event of trouble run for home - you don't have enough time in the pit of the G.50. to tango with any fighters.\n\n===========================\nAircraft: Fiat G.50\nPaintscheme: Default (Markings ON)\n
