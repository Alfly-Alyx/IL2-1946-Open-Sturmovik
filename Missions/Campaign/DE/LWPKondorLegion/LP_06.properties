Description May, 1937\nGrenzschutz Luftabteilung \nSwiss/ German border\n\nWelcome to your new unit, Leutenant Jedermann, - the Grenzschutz Luftabteilung. By all accounts your stay with us will be a long one so I suggest you \nsettle in quickly.I should add that you will not be spending much time here at Wolfgang Stadt.\nIndeed, most of the time you will be at our somewhat "rustic" strip southwest of here. Doubtless you will find it most ...character building.\n\nYour former Jagdfliegerschule Kommandant has informed us of both your qualities as a pilot and of your foolishness over Berlin. Although your action in helping to save  Prime Minister Daranyi's life over Berlin yesterday has gone some way to redeeming \nyou in the eyes of your superiors you are still knee deep in crap for buzzing the Fuehrer on his birthday. Insolent louse! Have you no respect for the Fuehrer?!Had I been your commanding officer I would have had you shot on landing!! I tell you now \nthat there will be none of that behaviour in this unit! Verstanden?!\n\nPatrolling the Swiss/ Reich border in this region is extremely hazardous due to the terrain and the weather so this posting will greatly test your flying abilities. Our neighbours, the Swiss, also operate BF109s so be alert to this fact. Your duties will consist principally of routine flights to make sure that no-one crosses into and more \nparticularly,out of, the Reich illegally. We have certainly taken down our fair share of \nplanes attempting to enter Switzerland over the past couple of years. Ungrateful wretches! After all our Fuehrer has done for Germany and her people. If it were up to me I would let them go - so much better for the purity of our nation! \n\n Where was I? Ah, yes. Your duties. Another aspect of your duties here will be interdicting smugglers. Officially we are to warn them and try to force them down so they can arrested. However, should they refuse to obey then harsher action may be \ntaken... The Reich has no place for those dealing in illicit goods and Bolshevik Fifth Columnists, so occasional "accidents" are overlooked...\n\nYour first flight will be at 0600hrs. You are to transfer to your main base on the southern slopes of Mt. Krasnopup. Take this opportunity to familiarise yourself with the area. The base is at an altitude of 2500m so watch your surroundings closely. 2000m is treetop level around these parts!\n\nNo other flights are reported in this area today so treat any unknown aircraft as potential targets. \nGet a good visual identification first though before...shall we say..."warning" ..them.\n\nDismissed! Heil Hitler!\n\n\n=======================\nAircraft: Hs-123 (CR-42)\nPaintscheme: vp_cr42_hs123_2.bmp \n(Markings ON)\n\n
