Description 1937, Eberswalde-Finow\nJagdfliegerschule 5 pilot training centre\n0400hrs\n\nGuten Morgen, Kadetten.\n\nAllow me to congratulate you on reaching this point in the Luftwaffe pilot training course. Thus far you have all performed well. However, now it is time to raise the bar. \nThe Luftwaffe represents the elite of our National Socialist military forces. If you are to succeed in taking your place in this new Luftwaffe you must prove your skill and your worth. \nThe Fuehrer and the Reich shall both have great need of you in the not-too-distant future and I am determined that none of the cadets under my supervision will fail them. Is that understood?!\n\n=========================\n\nToday you will be making your first solo flight in the Heinkel 50. Failure at this stage will result in your being removed from Jagdfliegerschule and transferred to desk duties, so apply the knowledge you have acquired over recent months and do as your instructors have told you. Only the finest will proceed to the next step. There is no place for error in this airforce. \nYour comrades who have died in the course of this training would attest to that.\n\nThe HE-50 is much more powerful than other planes you have flown. It will pull to the left when taking off so apply some right rudder and throttle up slowly. While taking off, line up with the runway by watching to the left and right. Once the wheels are off the ground the left wing will dip sharply unless you counter it with right stick and rudder.\n\nIn flight it has a tendency to fly nose-up so you'll need to trim it significantly to acheive level flight and best speed.\n\nAs it has no flaps you are to trim up a few notches and cut propellor pitch to 70% to lose speed before beginning your landing approach. Line the runway up nice and early and descend gradually- the forward vision is less than ideal so you won't be able to adjust much once you are on the way in.\nThrottle should be around 40% as you near the runway. Don't cut it suddenly or the wing will dip and you'll go in!\n\nRight! All set?\n\n------------------------------------------------\nTake off at 0430 and make for the village of Eberswalde-Finow to the northeast. From \nthere, follow the road east-south-east to Bad Freienwalde  before heading back to the \nairbase where you are to make one circuit before landing.\nUpon landing, taxi to the southeast apron marked with lights and  turn off your engine.\nFlight altitude is 1000m.\n\nGood luck, Kadetten.\n\nHeil Hitler.\n\n\n========================\nPlane: HE-50 (aka CR-42)\nPaintscheme: CR42-Tromplamort1-2-weathered\n\n\n\n\n\n
