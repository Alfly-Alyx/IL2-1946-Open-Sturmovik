Short Attack Republican shipping\n
Description Majorca, Spain\n5 July 1938\n0500hrs\n\nSo, you're not a morning person then, Signor Jedermann?\nApologies for waking you so early but there is work to be done. We have learned that \nanother shipment of Communist-supplied food and weapons is arriving at the \nRepublican base on Minorca. \n\nWe are going to make sure the supplies never arrive. \n\nA flight of Savoia- Marchettis will do the main work on shipping. However, as your planes have been modified to carry bombs we are asking you and Tischenko to go in first. \n\nFly at 2000m but when you get near the target area drop low and hunt for any escorting ships or cargo freighters. Be alert for friendly shipping - a number of German and Italian ships are patrolling off the \nwestern coast of Minorca.You will be carrying a single 250kg bomb each. \n\nAfterwards, patrol the area on the lookout for fighters. We don't expect there'll be much Republican air activity after their slaughter a week ago. \nNevertheless, keep your eyes open and don't hesitate to call for help if you need it.\n\nRemember, any supplies destroyed today will greatly speed the demise of the \nRepublicans and allow us Fascists to get this country back the way it should be. \n\n\n\n\n==================\nAircraft: BF-109E4\nPaintscheme: Schmoller-Haldy BF109E3\n(Markings OFF)\n\n\n\n\n
