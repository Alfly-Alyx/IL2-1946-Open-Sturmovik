Description Achtung, Kadet Jedermann!\n\nCongratulations on completing initial gliding training and basic flight training. Yourinstructors in the ..ahem.."German Air-Sports Association" are pleased with your performance. \n\nHowever, we here at Jagdfliegerschule 5 are going to apply the final polish to your skills. \nYou have shown great promise thus far so do not disappoint us. If you are good enough you may even have the honour of serving with our proud "volunteers" in the Condor Legion, where you'll be taking the fight to those verdammt Communists and Anarchists! \nBut there are no free rides here, even for a good Nazi boy like yourself. \nYou're not in the Hitlerjugend anymore.\n\nReport here tomorrow at 0400hrs.\n\nHeil Hitler!\n\n====================================\n*****
