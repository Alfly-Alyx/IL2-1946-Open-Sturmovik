Short Vengeance 1\n
Description 24 January 1938\nSomewhere in Spain...\n \nAchtung, Jagdfliegeren! Today we avenge our fallen.\n\nThose insolent Bolshevik and Anarchist bastards took us all by surprise yesterday.  Never again!\nThey must be made to pay for the casualties we suffered yesterday.  Good men were \nlost, along with most of our new 109s. The fires that still blaze around our base are those men's funeral pyres. We will see to it that their deaths were not in vain.\n\nColonel Richthofen  has quickly bolstered our AA defences and assembled \nserviceable aircraft from different units in the area. We are going to extract our \nrevenge on those damned Republicans. They shall pay in blood for this great insult! \nWe will regain control of the skies. Our vengeance starts today.\n\n=========================\nEscort the He-111s and the Hs-123s to their target, the Katyusha base in grid AN-11. \nThe He111s will be going in around 2000m while the Hs-123s will be attacking first at \nlow altitude. \nDestroy everything you encounter. \nAfter the Anarchist swines' effort of yesterday they'll probably be lazing around congratulating themselves so don't expect much in the way of opposition.\n\nThey wanted battle.\n\n We will oblige them.\n\n\n\n===================\nAircraft: BF109-E4\nPaintscheme:Schmuller-Hardy (Markings OFF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
