Short He-112 test pilot\n
Description March 1938\nSomewhere in Spain\n0410hrs\n\nMorning, Leutenant Jedermann,\nWell, well.  This Austrian business is starting to get fairly serious, eh? Tensions in central Europe are still climbing though so you may be getting some new opposition in the skies if the Fuehrer can't make Chamberlain see reason.  \nAnyway, high command are sending all the aircraft they can to sensitive \nareas, just in case the British or French try and start something and as a show of force. \n\nWhat it means for us here in Spain is no new 109s and the bare minimum of parts for \nthe time being. Still, it gives you a chance to brush up your skills.\n\nThe Luftwaffe is in the final stages of evaluating different fighter designs for mass-production. The frontrunner is the 109 but we are still hearing good comments about its rival, the He-112. Pilots are saying they prefer its wide-track undercart and visibility. They did mention it has a nasty tendency to pull right at take-off so be alert. A number of pilots have commented that it handles worse than a 109. Fly within your limits today.\nA number of our "Experten" have piloted it already, however high command also want \nto hear what some of our newer pilots think of it. \nI volunteered you to take it up for some gunnery practice today. \nNothing to worry about it, you'll only be taking on \nbarrage balloons for the viewing pleasure of a large number of senior officials who are visiting us to evaluate the new bird. \n\nThe barrage balloons are on the peninsula southwest of Sevastopol. The observers \nwill be to the east of the balloons. Be advised that they will be in bunkers for the most \npart but that there will also be an observation party watching from an observation balloon so watch \nwhat you're doing, yes?\nNow go and familiarise yourself with the 112.\n\nThat is all. \n\nDismissed.\n\n\n=====================\nAircraft: Yak -9\nPaintscheme: 1flechesanscocarde(Markings ON)\n\n
