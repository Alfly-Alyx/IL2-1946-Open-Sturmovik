Short Combat Air Patrol\n
Description February 1938\nSomewhere in Spain\n1140hrs\n\nBuenos dias, Leutenant Jedermann,\n\nIn the recent air battles  we have inflicted serious losses on the Republic's air force. We are determined to wrest absolute control of the air from them though. It is essential that they are not allowed a chance to rest and regroup.\n\nToday's mission is to lead a flight of 109's on a hunt for enemy aircraft. There is no set target, I suppose one could call it a "free hunt" for want of a better name.\n\nHead north-east along the main highway in the direction of Barcelona (code-named Simferopol on our maps). Once there, circle north-west over the city as far as the airstrip in sector AK-8. Then make one more circuit over the city and its satellite airstrip before returning to base. Get plenty of altitude to maximise your aircraft's chief advantage over the odds and ends they call an airforce - Ratas, Nieuports, Dewoitines and Moscas - Speed.\nDestroy anything that gets in your way.\n\nGood hunting!\nHorrido!\n\n============================\nAircraft: BF-109E4\nPaintscheme:$01-SCW-6-56-Bf109D of Gotthard Handrick.bmp\n(Mrkings OFF)\n\n
