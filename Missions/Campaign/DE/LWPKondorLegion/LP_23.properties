Description Majorca\nLate June 1938\n0640hrs\n\nMorning! Foul weather, isn't it? Despite that, we have a little job for you to do today. \nI knew you'd be pleased. \n\nSeeing as you are supposedly here on a research trip, the commander was wondering \nif you would actually like to find out about our "off-the-books" operations. Your \nresearch into the local alcohol varieties and beaches seems very advanced, but \nperhaps your higher-ups might be more interested in some other information, too. \nNow of course you know about the operations of this base and our bases on the \nmainland. What you probably didn't know is that we also operate a small "unofficial' \nairfield off the coast of French North Africa. Just keeping an eye on our neutral French \nfriends, of course. Nothing we shouldn't be doing. Often.\n\nYou're interested?Excellent. You'll get more details about the base and its operations  \nwhen you actually arrive there. \nFor now though, all you need to know is that a transport is heading for the island this \nmorning. Gather a few essentials together and jump into that G.50 we were playing \naround with the other day. You can ferry it to our southern strip where you'll meet up \nwith the transport that will be taking you off to our forward base. Taxi up to northern \nend and leave the Fiat in one of the shelters. Then you can just stroll up to the \ntransport.\n\nEnjoy the trip. See you in a week or so.\nArrivaderci!\n\n\n===============================\nAircraft: Fiat G.50\nPaintscheme: $01-SCW-1-1-FiatG50_nationalist.bmp\n(Markings ON)\n\n\n\n\n
