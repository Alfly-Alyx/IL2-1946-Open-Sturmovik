Short Ground attack training\n
Description February 1938\nSomewhere in Spain\n1140hrs\n\nBuenos dias, Leutenant Jedermann,\n\nI trust you have been enjoying the lull in operations in this region of late. In such a \nbeautiful location it is hard to believe there is a war going on - the women, the \nbeaches, the  cafes and bars, and especially the lights of the city at night. Ach,  it \nreminds me of Berlin on the Fuehrer's birthday. Yes, I was at the big rally you know... \nJedermann -are you okay?! You went all pale there..really?...you're sure you're \nfine?..good. Aah,  a good night last night, I bet. I see.  Nice to see high spirits in you \nlads! Enjoy it while you can. The enemy is almost certainly gathering his forces for a \nmajor offensive. That large force of bombers that you and Tischenko bombed on the \nground must have been reinforcements destined to take part in it. Well, not anymore \nthey won't be. Your actions there will save good men's lives.\n\nIn light of this period of calm and the  continued parts supply problems for our 109s \ndue to the situation in Czechoslovaia you are to undergo ground attack training in the \nHs-123. I hear you had some time in this bird in Switzerland so you should have few \nproblems. As part of the doctrine being developed by Colonel Richthofen and others \nin the Luftwaf..sorry.. the Condor Legion Volunteer  brigade.. we are working on tactics to allow our aircraft to operate in close support of our  panzers and infantry. \nThey're calling it "Donner und Blitzen" or some such thing...\n\nAnyway, today you are to take off at 1200hrs and head to our testing ground just to \nthe east of here where you are to practise your low-level bombing and strafing skills.  \nWe have set up some captured CNT-FAI trucks and armoured cars in a rough circle. \nIn the centre is a Soviet supplied light tank. You'll need a direct hit to destroy the armoured vehicles. Colonel Richthofen himself will be there observing so do a good job. His party will be in bunkers to the east of the target but very nearby so make sure of your target before you go in. By the way, watch out for passing shells whistling by your ear - our artillery boys are practising on the same site.\n\nDon't worry about enemy activity, we have established a ring of Fliegerabwehrkannonen sites around this entire area to allow us freedom of action.  \n\nNow even though it is just a practice, don't get careless. When the Republicans strike \nthat will be real men out there relying on your accuracy so do it right. \n\nBy the way, we have some adjustments to make to your plane so after landing please \ntaxi to the westernmost hangar. The groundcrew there are also working on some \nHE-170s. \n\n\n============================\nAircraft: Hs-123 (CR-42)\nPaintscheme:\n$01-SCW-24-3-CR42-Tromplamort6.bmp\n(Markings OFF)\n\n
