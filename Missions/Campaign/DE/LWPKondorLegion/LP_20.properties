Short Escort bombers over Minorca\n
Description Majorca, Spain\nJune 1938\n0700hrs\n\n\nBuongiorno Signors Jedermann, Tischenko! I am Capitan d'Amico, the liason officer. \nWelcome to our little island. Since your Italian is not so good I'll be briefing you during your stay with us. I'll also be on hand in the tower should you need to communicate with us here on base. \n\nThe mission is simple. Today we bomb the Bolshevist dogs on the neighbouring island of Minorca. They have dug themselves in well there. We will blast them out. \n\nOur main targets this time are their newly arrived Katyusha bombers and the other \nSoviet supply ships that have made it past our blockade. It is thought that they are in \ntransit to the mainland for the expected offensive.The first two flights of Savoia-Marchettis will focus on the shipping and dock area while the third flight and the CR-42's will attack the base. \nYou will be flying escort to keep any Republican flies off our bombers. Our pilots have reported encounters in this area with a Republican ace who goes by the nom-de-guerre, "Gaston". Watch out for him and his flight - they sport red fuselage bands and stabilisers.\n\nEnjoy the hunt!\n\n\n==================\nAircraft: BF-109E4\nPaintscheme: Schmoller-Haldy BF109E3\n(Markings OFF)\n\n\n\n\n
