Description March 1938\nSomewhere in Spain\n0800hrs\n\nGuten Morgen, Leutenant Jedermann,\nIt seems you will be needing your ground attack skills sooner than expected. A monarchist priest in a small town near here has learned that there is to be a meeting between the Civil Guard garrison and some well-known Communist figures. Previously the garrison has been loyal but a change in leadership has altered things. The local townsfolk are also known to be Communist sympathizers, or at least pro-Popular Front,  like most of the peasants in this damn country. The Italians' bombing of Barcelona no doubt stirred people up,too. With the rumours of a Republican offensive growing, a disloyal para-military force is the last thing we need near our base.\n\n\nThe priest also said that a lot of cars and trucks have been coming and going from the compound immediately south of the Civil Guard barracks.  He personally observed the commander of the Civil Guard speaking with armed men on the property and believes that is where the meeting is taking place. \n\nIt's time to break up this little plotters' party. Take one flight of He-123s armed with 100kg bombs and teach them what happens to dissenters and Bolsheviks. The target is the tree-lined compound immediately to the south of the large Civil Guard barracks. The barracks consists of several large, modern accomodation blocks so it should be easy to spot from the air. Watch for escaping vehicles. Anybody who tries to run is to be killed.\n\n=====================\nAircraft: Hs-123 (CR-42)\nPaintscheme: $01-SCW-24-3-CR42-Tromplamort6.bmp\n(Markings OFF)\n
