Description 27 January 1938\nSomewhere in Spain...\n1915hrs\n \n\nAt ease, Leutenant Jedermann. \n\nI must congratulate you. To even be standing here is no mean achievement. The savage bombing raids of the last few days have been extremely damaging for both sides, but particularly so for the Republicans, as they cannot replace their losses so easily. As for us, well we have truly been blooded now. That last raid scored a direct hit on our barracks and headquarters, as you know. Fortunately most men were at their posts so casualties were not as severe as they could have been. And you and your wingman did well to break up the bombers before they got here - your prowess has been noted. Nonetheless, it is time to abandon this base and regroup west of here. Even now, with the worst of the wreckage cleared away, fires are still burning in the heaviest hit parts of the base.\n\nAs you are one of our few pilots still fit for duty I am tasking you with this base's final combat mission. A low level surprise attack is planned for this evening to destroy their few remaining bombers. Our heavies did their job well but took a pounding so we're opting for the element of surprise this time.These scum have caught us off-guard twice but that will be their last throw of the die.\n\n=========================\nThree of our older109s have been rigged to carry several small bombs. You, Mahler and Tischenko are to wipe out the remaining Republican aircraft at their staging base (in grid AS-11 on your flight maps) before they have a chance to withdraw and regroup.\nThe three of you will be on your own so you'll have to fly low to evade detection en route. \n\nUse the river valleys and mountain passes where you can. On the way in, try to avoid the coast as it is more populated. It's risky but at the moment we have lost local air superiority. Our planners have also tried to route you around known flak concentrations hence the rather circuitous flightpath.\n\nGet them, Jedermann. Look at what those bastards have done to this base, our men.\n\nThat is all. Good luck, and see you at our new base.\n\nHeil Hitler.\n\n\n===================\nAircraft: BF109-E4/B\nPaintscheme:$01-SCW-6-56-dirty (Markings OFF)\n\n\n\n\n\n
