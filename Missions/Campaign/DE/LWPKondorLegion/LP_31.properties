Short Finsh them off! \n
Description August 1938\nSpain\n1800hrs\n\nActung Fliegeren! \n\nWe have broken them! Thanks to the determination and courage of our Nationalist infantry and, of course, our outstanding work in providing air-support, we have stopped their drive dead. Republican units on our side of the river are being steadily depleted. Those on the northern side are retreating in disorder, hoping to creep away as evening falls.\nI'm afraid they are out of luck. Today is the last day of the rest of their lives.\n\nAll available aircraft have been tasked with harrassing the enemy's withdraw. Forget the remnants on the southern side of the Ebro - they are already dead. Your focus will be on the convoys withdrawing to the north. The most likely destination is the town of Saki.  We have reconaissance flights up scouring the area for them but as yet no sightings.\n\nGet airborne and patrol the area north of the Ebro river. Follow the highways and scan them for targets. Once spotted, engage and destroy. You will be armed with four 50kg bombs. \nUse them well. Be alert for fighters, too. We have larned that the Republican ace, "Gaston", is with us once again.\n\nAs a morale booster for our troops, we have set your flight path to pass directly over the battlefield. Go in low and give them a good show! Once over the river, stay fairly low to best spot the retreating columns. Inflict the maximum damage. This loss will be decisive, one feels. the Ebro Offensive may not be ove yet but the pendulum has swung. There is no way the Republicans will be able to swallow these losses - over 15,00 dead in two weeks!\n\nSo do this mission right and this war will over in weeks!\n\nOnce you have returned to base, park up in the north east hangar. \n\nTo your aircraft! Good hunting, men!\n\n\n=====================\nAircraft: BF-109E4/B\nPaintscheme: $01-SCW-6-119.bmp (Markings OFF)\n\n
