Name LP21
Short Defend Majorca - scramble!\n
Description Majorca, Spain\n25 June 1938\n1150hrs\n\nJedermann,\nWe have detected a raid bearing in from the northwest, ETA  12:15pm. It looks to be \nheading for the naval station and the dockyard area. All fighters are to scramble and \nintercept the raiders. Get airborne and start quartering the area northwest of the \ndocks. As your wingman's plane is undergoing some repairs you'll be on your own this \ntime, Jedermann, so watch your back. But don't worry, some of our best fighter pilots \nwill be up there with you. Use the radio if you need assistance.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n==================\nAircraft: BF-109E4\nPaintscheme: Schmoller-Haldy BF109E3\n(Markings OFF)\n\n\n\n\n
