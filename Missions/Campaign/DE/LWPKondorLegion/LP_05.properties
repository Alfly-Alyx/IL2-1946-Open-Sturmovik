Short Ferry flight duty\n
Description 21 April 1937, Eberswald-Finow\nJagdfliegerschule 5\n1700hrs\n\n...and you really thought no-one would notice???!!!! 500m!!! What kind of idiot are \nyou?!You were lucky the S.S. didn't shoot you down for endangering the Fuehrer's \nlife!! \nThat's to say nothing of your looping merrily in and out of Tegel airport's airspace while \nthe Prime Minister of Hungary was flying in!!\n\nIf you weren't so obviously an outstanding pilot you would be kicked out of here \nstraight into the Wehrmacht where you would end your days shovelling Landsers' crap \nout of latrines!!! As it is, you'll still graduate from the school but you have left us no \nchoice other than to rip up your transfer papers for the Condor Legion. That's right, \nJedermann. You threw it all away...\n\nYour first assignment as a full, albeit stupid, member of the Luftwaffe starts today. You \nare now officially...a ferry pilot.  \nA  flight of BF-109E's arrived last night during your little jaunt over Berlin. Had you not been such a spectacular fool you would have been on a transport today bound for the Condor Legion in Spain. \n\nAs it is, you will be ferrying the real fighter pilots' planes to a small airbase 50 kilometres south of Berlin. From there other pilots will pick them up while you catch a transport to your real assignment - Grenzschutz - border patrol flights on the Swiss border. I wanted to find you something more tedious but I'm afraid there simply wasn't anything with fewer prospects of action available.\n\nOh, before you go, Kalman Daranyi, the Prime Minister of Hungary shall be departing \nfrom Tegel airport this morning. The Gestapo have issued a notice advising all units in the Berlin area to be on the look-out for any untoward behaviour. It seems that a few old biplanes were reported missing yesterday and that a noted critic of the current Hungarian regime, known to them only as "V.P."  or "Istvan" was sighted in the vicinity. \nProbably nothing, I'm sure but keep an eye out.\n\nNow get out of my sight!\n\nDismissed!\n\n============================\nAircraft: BF-109E4\nPaintscheme: Handrickunmarked.bmp \nMarkings ON\n\n\n
