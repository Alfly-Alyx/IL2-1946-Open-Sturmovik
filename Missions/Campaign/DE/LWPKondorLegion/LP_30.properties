Short Escort Stukas over the Ebro River \n
Description August 1938\nSpain\n1700hrs\n\nGentlemen. \nAs you no doubt know, our Stukas have arrived. \nWe're in business!\n\nThe first mission they will perform in this area is to finally finish off those flimsy bridges thrown up by the Commie- Anarchist forces. With the bridges destroyed, their lines of retreat will be cut, allowing us to take them apart at our leisure. Most of our reinforcements have arrived or are en route.  The Bolshevists may have thought they hit us hard but they are about to receive an unwelcome shock.\n\nThe enemy's losses in men and materiel have already been staggering and we have pared away their numerical superiority in the air, too. Their units are just thrown together remnants. The battlefield is littered with burnt out armour and bodies. We may admire the Republican fighters' bravery -with their gallant charges across open ground - but we will not be following their tactics. Running fast and shouting heroic slogans is one thing but, me, I'll take Stukas, artillery and heavy machine guns anyday. \nThe Republican soldiers are paying in blood while their rival factions fight to gain influence internally and to recapture support internationally. With the situation in Czechoslovakia, the world has turned its eyes away from this little section of hell.  \n\nIntelligence has informed us that their are severe rifts opening in the Popular Front. This soon-to-be crushed offensive is an opportunity to widen that rift and is also an object lesson in why politicians should not control the battlefield. We must  all be grateful that our leadership would never contemplate such folly.\n\n-------------------\nYou are to lead 2 flights of 109s and fly escort for the Stukas. Climb to 3,000m, orbit the battlefield until the Stukas have done their work, then see them safely home.\nThe pilots and the Stukas are the elite of our air force. Protect them well and see to it that they do not fall into enemy hands!\n\n\nHeil Hitler! Dismissed!!\n\n\n \n=====================\nAircraft: BF-109E4/B\nPaintscheme: $01-SCW-6-119.bmp (Markings OFF)\n\n
