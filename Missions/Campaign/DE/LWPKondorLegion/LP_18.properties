Description March 1938\nSomewhere in Spain\n1755hrs\n\nAchtung, Fliegeren!\n\nWe have a new mission for you this evening. After our successful raid this afternoon \non the Fifth Columnists' meeting, those who survived sought revenge on the people \nwho had informed on them. That's right - our friend, the local priest. In fact, all of the churches in the town have been torched and their priests killed. This has triggered some vicious fighting in the town. The peasants here are getting back at the Catholic church for its collusion with the Monarchists and Fascists. \nThe Nationalist leaders are outraged by this "atrocity", as they are labelling it, and have asked us to make the town pay for this abomination against God. \nThis will be an excellent chance to refine some more techniques that are being developed by the \nLegion's  tacticians.\n\nYour mission will be to fly escort in your Hs-123s to the three flights of He-111's and a handful of He-170s that will be trying out the new "carpet-bombing" technique. You are also required to bomb and strafe any vehicles in the area to cause maximum disruption. The most likely escape routes will be to the north so look for vehicle columns. This,too, is a part of the new \ndoctrine being put together. Now don't let your consciences bother you - these filth \nmurdered priests and burned down their churches! It is no less than they deserve.\nAs for the civilians, they were warned by leaflet drop to evacuate the town or pay the \nconsequences.  \n\nUpon your return to base, pack your effects and head out to your Emil. It has been \npatched up just like new. You're in for a change of scenery, my boy.\n\n=====================\nAircraft: Hs-123 (CR-42)\nPaintscheme: $01-SCW-24-3-CR42-Tromplamort6.bmp (Markings OFF)\n\n
