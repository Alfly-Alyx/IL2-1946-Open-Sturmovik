Name LP28
Short Combat Air patrol/strafe over the Ebro River \n
Description July 1938\nSpain\n0640hrs\n\nAchtung meine Herren! \n\nGood work with the fighters but I'm afraid your work is not done yet. Not by a long way. The Republicans still have a numerical advantage over us in the air. As the Stukas are still not here, the Hs-123s, along with our allied aircraft, will be going in again to support the ground troops. This despite the heavy casualties they have been taking today. That flak is murderous!\nYou are going to keep them safe, understand?!\n\nYour mission is two-fold. First you are to fly in ahead of the Henschels and bomb any flak or other targets of opportunity. \n\nTake off, head north at 1200m. Upon crossing the river south of the battle zone, descend to 400m . Fly along the Ebro River and make one pass along the main line of the enemy's advance. You are to go in line abreast, at tree-top height and at maximum power. You will be armed with four 50kg bombs. \nRemember to keep those radiator flaps closed for extra engine protection and keep your eyes open for enemy fighters!\n\nAfter your run, re-form north of the river and gain altitude. \nMake two circuits above the battle field to keep the skies clean of Republican flies while our Henschels do their work. \nStay alert! We want everyone to make it back from this one!\n\nHeil Hitler! Dismissed!!\n\n\n \n=====================\nAircraft: BF-109E4/B\nPaintscheme: $01-SCW-6-119.bmp (Markings OFF)\n\n
