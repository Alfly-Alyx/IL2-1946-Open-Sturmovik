Short Locate smugglers' base.\n
Description Late1937\nSwiss/Reich border\nKrasnopup airfield\n0145hrs \n\nGuten Abend..Morgen...Nacht, Jedermann.\nSo sorry to ruin your beauty sleep once again but the mission is important.\n\nAs you have doubtless noticed, smuggler activity has increased noticeably in the last few months. This afternoon we think we cracked the major ring in this area. This band not only smuggle illicit goods into the Reich,but more seriously they are also smuggling key scientists out, where their knowledge may pose a grave threat to our nation's security!We have a rough idea of the location of their base, too. It's south of our Wagner Stadt airfield on the Swiss side of the river. Those thugs are thumbing at their noses at us, knowing that the Swiss authorities will turn a blind eye! Well they're not going to get away with it this time.\n\nOur source, with the help of some friendly encouragement from the Kripo, told us a light aircraft full of contraband will be heading to their secret night-time airstrip, somewhere in the mountains to the southwest of here. Your mission is to tail it to the base, destroy it and any other targets you see. If you can locate their warehouses near the river then so much the better. It'll make it easier for us to eliminate later.\n\nRemember though, you must make it back here in one piece. You'll be violating Swiss airspace tonight and we cannot risk any  embarrassing incidents. Our Fuehrer is a man of peace, remember. Any border problems may alarm them and our other neighbours and it would be unfortunate to forewarn them before we are ready. \nGreat things are coming, Jedermann...\n\nIf you can do this right, consider your transfer request approved. Don't ruin this chance.\n\nHeil Hitler!\n\n\n\n=============================\nAircraft:BF109-E4\nPaintscheme: Handrickunmarked\n\n
