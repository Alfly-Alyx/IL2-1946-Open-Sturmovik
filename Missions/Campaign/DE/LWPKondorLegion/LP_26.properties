Short Combat Air patrol over the Ebro River\n
Description July 1938\nSpain\n0315hrs\n\nAchtung Fliegeren!\n\nWilkommen Leutnant Jedermann.\nWe are pleased to have you back from your stint with our Italian brothers.  \n\nThe reports you put together concerning the French escorted convoys and the transfer of Russian bombers via French North Africa were invaluable for our preparations against the Republicans' offensive. It seems our French amis are not as neutral as we suspected. Nevermind, they will pay for their sins soon. Not yet, but soon.\n\n--------------------------------\nAnd now to matters at hand.  \nForty minutes ago elements of the Republican forces crossed the River Ebro in massive numbers. This offensive poses a real threat to Fascist deployments in the area. Fortunately they haven't yet reached the high ground which is still controlled by General Barron's troops, backed by our own Condor Legion.\nJedermann, it seems that you made it back from the Mediterranean  just in time to join in the fun. \nIt's been particularly quiet here recently, virtually no enemy aircraft in the skies. \n\nI rather suspect that is about to change... \n\nYour mission this morning is to assist our Hs-123s in blowing seven kinds of hell out of the Republican forces. Watch out for flak. As for fighters, our Spanish allies are tying them up further north so you should get a clear run. Make the most of this chance - a lot of our men's lives are depending on you. \n\nJedermann, you will be leading a flight of 109s. Head north - you won't miss it, trust me. Primary targets are flak units but don't be too picky. You'll have plenty of choice! \nOur units are to the south and have swastika flags draped behind them to aid in identification from the air. By all reports they are holding on by the skin of their teeth so get out there and use your bombs to help them!\n\nGive them hell!!!\n\n=====================\nAircraft: BF-109E4/B\nPaintscheme: $01-SCW-6-119.bmp (Markings OFF)\n
