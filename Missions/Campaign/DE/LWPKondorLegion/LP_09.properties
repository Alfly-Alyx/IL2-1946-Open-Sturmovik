Name LP09
Short Hunt the traitor!\n
Description Late1937\nSwiss/Reich border\nKrasnopup airfield \n0500hrs\n\n\nWakey-wakey, Jedermann!\nA suspected Communist pilot has stolen a 109 and some classified technical \ndocuments and is attempting to escape to Switzerland. His vociferous criticism of the \nNazi party and leadership earned him some close attention from the Gestapo. \nEvidently he had something to hide. \n\nHe's making for the Swiss border but must NOT arrive there in one piece. Your \nfortunes would revive considerably if you pull this one off, Jedermann. It could even \nget you out of this dump and into the Condor Legion...\n\nExcellent! I knew I could rely on you. Take one of the 109's- it is imperative that the \ntraitor not escape. He'll probably be taking the most direct route so search along the \nriver valley for him.  \n\nOh, and maybe you can get some revenge of your own as well. Did I not tell you?\nIt's your old classmate...\n                                                    \n...Meier.\n\n\n\n========================\nAircraft:BF-109E\nPaintscheme: Handrickunmarked\n\n\n
