Short Recon flight - naval convoy\n
Description Italian Reconaissance Airfield,\nOff the coast of North Africa,\nLate June, 1938\n1530hrs\n\nAt ease.\nGood work on the reconaissance flight, Jedermann. No-one here has ever seen a \nsupply convoy of such size! The escort was also unexpected. Sorry about our poor \nintelligence there. It looks like they are gearing up for an offensive. At last our decisive \nbattle is coming...\n\nThe damned French are obviously allowing aid and materiel convoys to form up in their territorial waters before they risk their lives penetrating our blockade... sorry, I meant the Non-Intervention Committee's blockade.This despite their alleged halt in support of the Republicans!\nWe can't attack them in their own waters - that would be too inflammatory and and may goad the snivelling "democracies" into intervening directly in Spain. That would not greatly please Franco, I think we can safely assume. \nHowever, if we can locate it and radio their current heading it'll be a piece of cake for our lads on Majorca to launch some kind of strike. Every ship we sink out at sea bleeds the Bolsheviks, saves the lives of our men and, more importantly, advances the cause of Fascism.\n\nFind the convoy and report back here immediately. \nStart your search in the vicinity of the eastern island. Altitude 2500m.\n\nDismissed!\n\n\n===============================\n\n\nAircraft: Fiat G.50\nPaintscheme: Default (Markings ON)\n\n
