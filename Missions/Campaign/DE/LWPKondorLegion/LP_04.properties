Description 20 April, 1937\nEberswald-Finow\nJagdfliegerschule 5\n2130hrs\n\nHey! Hey!! Jedermann!! Over here! It's me -  Kadet Meier. \n\nYou hear about the big rally in Berlin for the Fuehrer's Birthday? I heard the whole town's lit up to honour him. I'd kill to go and see all those fat old Nazi's drooling over him but unfortunately I'm stuck here.\nYou've got instrument flying practice tonight, right? Well me and the rest of the boys were talking and we think you ought to "accidentally" go off course tonight and have a look at the sights! You know that any of us would do it in a flash if we had the chance but we are all on watch duty after that little incident concerning my impression of old Adolf. I thought it was rather good myself... these Nazis have no sense of humour. Anyway, are you up for it?\n\nOh, go on, don't be such a girl! I can see you're tempted. Besides, we've almost completed the course and you're top of the class. Some of the instructors are practically in love with you so even if you get caught, nothing bad will happen. Not to you, the star cadet of Jagdfliegerschule 5. Now, am I wrong? \n\nAlright,that's the spirit.  Well we heard that the rally is taking place in the Sportspalast around 10pm. Why don't you put on a show for the party faithful by buzzing the stadium a couple of times??!! Show the Fuehrer how skilled his lads in the Luftwaffe are! Should liven things up a bit, eh?Around 500m ought to do the trick. Any lower and they might be able to identify our unit markings!\n\nYou should also pay a visit to the Reichstag and all the other ministries. A night like this, they're bound to be illuminated. It should be quite a sight. After that, head south to the airport and show them how real pilots can fly!!! The Beobachter this morning had an article saying how a load of foreign dignitaries are flying in to Berlin tonight to mark the event, so see if you can spot any big names.\n\nLook. Will you relax? Me and the boys will cover for you. I've already gone and written up a false maintenance entry for the bird you'll be taking up. I said the compass seems to be acting up. See? I've thought of everything! What could possibly go wrong?\n\n\n\n============================\nAircraft: CR-42\nPaintscheme: Tromplamort1-2-weathered (Markings OFF)\n\n\n
