Short Gunnery training\n
Description Early 1937, Eberswald-Finow\nJagdfliegerschule 5\n1400hrs\n\nGuten Tag, Kadetten.\n\nYou have all done well to reach this stage. As a group your grasp of the basics of flight does you all credit. I would however like to single out one Kadet in particular, you, Herr Jedermann. \nYour performance to date has been exemplary. Congratulations. I am confident that you will receive your pick of assignments should you continue in this vein until graduation. May I suggest you start brushing up on your Spanish...\n\nHowever,don't get cocky and careless. Ours is a dangerous trade and one mistake will cost you your life. That goes for all of you.\n\nShortly you will be graduating and moving out to your assigned Geschwadern. It is highly likely that we shall find ourselves at war, sooner rather than later. In combat, fancy flying is one thing  but gunnery is what will save your life and let you take the life of your enemy. To that end, today we begin aerial gunnery training.\n\nOur targets for today are a series of barrage balloons located along a river to the south-east of Berlin. To succeed you are expected to down at least half of the balloons.They are at varying altitudes up to 2000m so you will have  to keep your \neyes open  both above and below. Learn that habit well, for once you enter combat it will be the difference between medals and champagne, and an unwelcome telegram for your dear old Mutti. \n\nAs you will be passing through Berlin's airspace en route to the target, keep a close eye out for civilian and other military air traffic. We have already received too many complaints from air authorities and local citizens concerning the reckless endeavours of Fliegerkadetten! \nDiscipline wins battles - remember that! \nAny joyriding or sightseeing will be dealt with very severely!\n\n\n\n=======================\nPaintscheme: CR42-Tromplamort1-2-weathered\n\n
