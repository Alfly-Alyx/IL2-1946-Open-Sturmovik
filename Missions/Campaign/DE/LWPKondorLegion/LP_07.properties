Description May 1937, Swiss/ Reich Border,\nKrasnopup border patrol airstrip\n1617hrs\n\nAh. Herr Jedermann! I congratulate you on your good work with that interdiction the other day. Not many brand new pilots claim a kill so soon out of Jagdfliegerschule. \nKeep it up and you may yet get back in the good books. Actually, on that topic, your old classmate, Meier, has appealed to get you reassigned to the Condor Legion, claiming he had put you up to that little stunt over Berlin. A nice gesture but to be \nhonest, support from such an outspoken critic of the Nazi party will do you more harm than good. \nIt seems Leutenant Meier is creating quite a name for himself. An ambitious party man like yourself would do well to stay away from the likes of him...\n\nI called you in today as I have an important task for you. A covert detachment went across the Swiss border to inspect the wreckage of the plane you shot down. They found some documents which are of great interest to... well, that doesn't concern you. \nYour job is simply to ensure that the documents are onboard the Ju-52 flying out for Berlin this afternoon. The flight leaves at 1639hrs so get going. \n\nThe groundcrew have fuelled up one of the Hs-123s for you again as all the operational 109s are in use.\nOnce you arrive at Wagner Stadt, taxi to the Ju-52 apron and hand the envelope to the courier in the Kubelwagen. There's no time to waste -Mach schnell!!!You've got about 15mins to get there, land, taxi over to the Kubelwagen and hand over the message. Go! Watch out for the crosswind!!\n\n\n=====================\nPlane: Hs-123 (CR-42)\nPaintscheme: vp_cr42_hs123_2(Markings ON)\n\n\n\n
