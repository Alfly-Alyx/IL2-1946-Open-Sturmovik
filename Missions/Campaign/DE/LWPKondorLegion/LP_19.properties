Short Transit to Majorca\n
Description Somewhere over the Mediterranean\nJune 1938\n1200hrs\n\n======================\n    *TOP SECRET *\n Open once underway.\n--------------------------------------\nLeutenant Jedermann,\n\nAs you may have guessed from the company you're in, you and Tischenko have been \nassigned to help escort our Italian ally's  new S.M.-79s to the major Aviacon \nLegionaria's base on the island of Majorca. A number of their CR-42s will also be \nalong for the ride. Their similarity to our He-123s really is quite remarkable. \n\nAnyway, you will remain with the Italians on a temporary detachment  where you are to \nact as an observer.  The Italian forces have proven very effective in this war so see \nwhat you can pick from them. Don't get too settled into the island lifestyle though - \nwe'll be needing all of our experienced pilots right here when the coming storm hits. \nIntelligence believes the offensive will take place in August so there is still time to \nspare.\n\nThe flight should prove uneventful. It is a long flight though, so keep a close eye on \nyour fuel guage. We are forecasting clear skies the entire way to Majorca so the \nscenery should be pleasing. \nOur Italian friends and the Nationalist's naval forces have almost a free hand on the \nseas so any shipping you see will be either friendly or belonging to the Non-\nIntervention Committee (and they have been well and truly neutered). As for the much\n-vaunted Royal Navy and Air Force, they are much too cowardly to act against us for fear ofdamaging relations with the Fascist axis. They even signed a treaty with the Italians, for god's sake! Now the Italians aren't even disguising their involvement but instead are displaying their Fasces proudly on their aircraft. The Anschluss with our Austrian brothers back in March showed how  fearful and weak the so-called "Great Democracies" truly are. \nThey do not deserve to be masters of Europe. That is our task.\n\nHeil Hitler,\n\nKommandant W.
