Description August 1938\nSpain\n1815hrs\n\nGuten Abend,\n Apologies for ruining your dinner but there's a mission on for tonight.\nThe Republicans are trying a new tactic today - they're after our resupply vessels. We have received word that there are multiple enemy flights approaching the port from the west. We have no idea of numbers as yet but they're almost definitely heading for the transport ships that are scheduled to arrive this morning.\n\nGet up there and see to it that no harm comes to those ships. And remember, I know it may seem as if they have hordes of aircraft, but believe me- we have them on the ropes now!  With their foreign "aid" almost completely dried up, coupled with the  staggering amount of materiel they have lost in this offensive they can ill afford any further losses in aircraft or aircrew.  \n\nBleed them.\nTo your aircraft.\n\n=====================\nAircraft: BF-109E4/B\nPaintscheme: $01-SCW-6-119.bmp (Markings OFF)\n
