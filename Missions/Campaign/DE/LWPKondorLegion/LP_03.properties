Short Unpowered landing practice.\n
Description February 1937, Eberswald-Finow\nJagdfliegerschule 5\n0650hrs\n\nGuten Tag, Kadetten.\n\nYour performance on the gunnery assignment was not completely awful. Congratulations. Now perhaps only half of you will be gunned down helplessly when you get into real combat. Make sure your affairs are in order before you get assigned to your Geschwadern, won't you?\n\nToday we practise two of every Kadet's favourite things - landings and engine cut-outs!\nAs you are aware, the HE-50's engine is not fuel-injected. This means that in negative-G manoeuvres, like when you dip the nose sharply, the fuel supply to the engine is cut, resulting in the engine cutting out. It is easy enough to avoid this by merely flicking the nose to one side before diving in order to force fuel into the engine. However, should it happen in combat, or should your engine be knocked out by enemy fire it is important that you be able to control the aircraft without power should circumstances require it. \n\nThat's why today you are to take your planes up to 2500m, cut the engines and gradually lose altitude by circling in a landing pattern over the airfield. Only once you have dropped below 400m and are on your final approach to the airfield may you restart your engines.\nYou will all take off at intervals. Kadet Jedermann, you are number three. Everyone - watch the airspace around you - it's going to be busy!\nOnce you have landed, taxi to the south-west apron and park next to the other HE-50's.\nWe instructors will be watching and LISTENING very carefully from...ah... the safety of a reinforced concrete building. Anyone who turns on their engine too early will be removed from the course. Any Kadet who is good enough to make an unpowered landing gets all the beer he can drink!\n\nThat is all. To your aircraft!\n\nHeil Hitler!\n\n\n\n=======================\nPaintscheme: CR42-Tromplamort1-2-weathered\n\n
