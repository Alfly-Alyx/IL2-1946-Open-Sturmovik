Description MISSION #4:  Escort\n\nTIME:  1315\n\nWEATHER:  Turbulence at low levels\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162A\n\nThis afternoon, we will attack the enemy airbase at Weinoden (sector J-17).\n\nBlitz bombers will hug the ground all the way to the target in order to evade AA.  Remember, the Arado bombers are virtually defenceless, except for their speed.  Protecting them is more important than getting kills.  Stay with them all the way to and from the target.  There are many Soviet fighters in the air today.\n
