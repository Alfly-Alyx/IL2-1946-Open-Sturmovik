BALTIC SPARROWS 1946 is a 35-mission campaign for the He-162.  In it, you will fly all three available types of the Sparrow into battle against the Soviets in a fictional, late 1946 scenario.

I designed this campaign to run smoothly on a mid-range computer while maintaining a good "immersion" level.

The campaign includes two brief movies, and utilizes stock skins.

Maps used:  Northwest Europe, Kurland (autumn), Gulf of Finland (fall and winter).

To install:  While outside the game, extract the "Baltic_Sparrows_46" folder from the zip file that you downloaded from the net.  Install the extracted file into the following IL-2 1946 folder:
...Missions/Campaign/DE

"Baltic_Sparrows_46" should then appear as an option in your in-game Pilot Career menu under "Germany."

By the way:  this very fictional campaign has no political meaning whatsoever.  It is to be taken purely as entertainment, and I hope you enjoy flying it as much as I enjoyed putting it together.		-Eldon45
