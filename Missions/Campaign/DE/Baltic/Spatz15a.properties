Name Spatz15a
Description MISSION #15:  Dogfight\n\nTIME:  1130\n\nWEATHER:  Clear\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nWe have taken Riga.  Now we will tighten the noose on the enemy forces trapped in the northern "head" of the peninsula.\n\nWe are now operating with a full complement of "C" Sparrows.  \n\nThe enemy fighter base at Zabeln (sector O-25) still fields a substantial force.  Their Yak pilots are aggressive and they have been taking an unacceptable toll on our attack planes.\n\nToday you will fly a sweep near their base with the object of drawing them into battle.  You will lead white flights one and two.  Bruckner will lead black flight.\n\nGain altitude by flying north and then do a broad turn south to their base (see your map).  As you tell your own boys:  with Yaks it's just a matter of staying above them and maintaining energy.  Zoom down on them and clip their wings.  Good hunting!\n
