Description MISSION #5:  Defend Our Ships\n\nTIME:  0640\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162A\n\nThe Soviets have been using a lot of old prop planes up here, albeit with more skill in general than back in '41-'44.  It's only a matter of time, however, before they begin to send better planes and pilots.\n\nFor now, the enemy is in retreat and we must exploit the chaotic situation. \n\nWe are preparing to encircle the coastal city of Libau.\n\nThe city has been reduced to rubble, but a sizeable Red Army force still huddles in the ruins by the seaside.\n\nAll night one of our battleships has been keeping the holdouts awake.\n\nA formation of Soviet attack aircraft has been spotted heading south along the coast at low altitude towards our ships at Libau.  \n\nTake off and fly to the north of Libau.  You must fend off any attempted attack on our warships.\n
