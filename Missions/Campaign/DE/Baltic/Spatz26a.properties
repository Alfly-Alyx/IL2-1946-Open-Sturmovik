Description MISSION #26: Transfer to Suur-Merijoki\n\nTIME:  1620\n\nWEATHER:  Rain\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162D\n\nThe Finns have taken Vjipuri.  The stage is now set for our winter offensive on Leningrad.\n\nFrom terrible past experience fighting the Russians, we can count on their resistance stiffening considerably as we approach the ruined, but heavily defended city.\n\nIn the north, we will fight side by side with our Finnish allies.  We are quickly resupplying them with many new planes and modern armor.  Our forces will be concentrated in the northwest approaches to Leningrad, while the Finns will move down the Lake Ladoga coast.\n\nThis afternoon you will transfer to the airbase at Suur-Merijoki northwest of Viborg.  The rain should deter most enemy fighter action today.\n
