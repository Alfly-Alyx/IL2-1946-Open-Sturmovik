Name Spatz22a
Description MISSION #22:  Cut the Shipping Lines\n\nTIME: 0615\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nWe have taken Narva.\n\nSoon you will be the first fighter group in the Luftwaffe to receive the new "D" model of the Sparrow.  It's nice not to be last in line anymore, isn't it.\n\nNow a large German Naval and Marine force is heading towards the mid-gulf islands of Lavansaari and Seiskari.  These islands, once taken, will be "unsinkable aircraft carriers" from which we can attack any point in the gulf area quickly.\n\nThe Soviets have made vast efforts to fortify the islands, but our U-boats have wreaked havoc upon their supply convoys and warships.  Still, the enemy's sheer numbers are paying off, and some supply ships are getting through.\n\nToday, you will escort attack Me-262s to the waters between the islands to attack an enemy convoy.  Stay at or below 200 meters till you're close to the target.  Defend the bombers!\n
