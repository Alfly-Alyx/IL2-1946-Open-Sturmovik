Description MISSION #16:  Train Wreck\n\nTIME:  0830\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nA few more missions in Kurland, and we're sending you home for some time with your wife and kids.\n\nOnly one rail line now provides the Soviets in the north Kurland pocket with a viable overland route to the east.  Ninety percent of their supplies must flow through this narrow vein.  The rail/highway junction at Doblen (sector S-20) has become especially vital to them.\n\nThis morning you and your wingman will escort Blitz bombers to the target.  Protect the Arados while they destroy the enemy staging area.\n
