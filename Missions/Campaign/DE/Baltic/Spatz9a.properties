Description MISSION #9:  Intercept Bombers\n\nTIME:  1530\n\nWEATHER:  Hazy, with turbulence.\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162A\n\nThe pressure is rising now as the enemy comes at us in greater numbers.  Our nine remaining battle-worthy Heinkels are getting tired and our mechanics complain of a shortage of spare parts.  We are assured that this is a supply "hiccup" and we'll soon be moving forward again.\n\nAn enemy bomber formation has been spotted heading from Riga towards Libau.  It's not often we get a chance to intercept these raids by day.  Take up all the available fighters you have.  We must stop them from disrupting our supply efforts at the Libau shipyards.\n\nTake off, gain altitude quickly, and fly east-northeast to intercept the bombers.\n
