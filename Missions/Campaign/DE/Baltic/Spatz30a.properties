Description MISSION #30:  Intercept the Tu-4s\n\nTIME:  1545\n\nWEATHER:  Hazy\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162D\n\nThe Soviets have been launching sporadic B-29 raids against Finnish urban targets.  They come in late in the afternoons so they can bomb in the light, and then escape with the aid of oncoming darkness.\n\nOur radar has picked up a wave that fits the profile for one of these raids.  The Soviet B-29s ("Tu-4s") come in from the southeast, from bases near Novgorod.  Hamina, Kotka, and Helsinki have been targeted repeatedly.\n\nSoviet jet fighters are generally hampered by short range, making escort missions complicated.  They have been using old, long-legged prop fighters with drop tanks for the duration of the runs, and sending up jets in relays at key interception points.  \n\nThe second flight will deal with enemy escort fighters.  Finnish Ta-152s should also be showing up to assist with fighters.  You must reach a height of 5500-6000 meters to effectively intercept the bombers.  \n\nFor your flight's part, do not let any fighters lure you away from your main goal:  destroy all the B-29s!\n\nGood luck!\n
