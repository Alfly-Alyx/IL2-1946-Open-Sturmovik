Description MISSION 34:  Favor\n\nTIME:  1330\n\nWEATHER:  Blind\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162D\n\nStrange deeds are afoot, but we are told very little.\n\nIt seems a Russian bomber carrying a Soviet political figure will be flying from a base east of Leningrad over the city just after 1330 this afternoon, towards Kronstadt.\n\nIt will be escorted by four I-250s.\n\nWe must not take off till the last possible minute.\n\nWe are to make sure that the bomber--and its passengers--do not make it to Kronstadt.\n\nMore mysteriously, one of our higher-ups let it drop that we are not to worry too much about any flak or enemy planes bothering us from Kronstadt.\n\nOn the other hand, try to avoid the airspace over Leningrad.  The flak is heavy there.\n\nGet that bomber!\n
