Description MISSION #29: Visit to an Old Friend\n\nTIME:  1500\n\nWEATHER:  Blind\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162D\n\nThis morning's raid has forced us to modify some plans.  The boys from Rompotti damaged several of our Finnish Pfeils and Ta-152s--and a few Sparrows as well--on the ground.\n\nWe will be returning the gift to the enemy base at Rompotti this afternoon.  Our raid will be the first act in an all-out Army offensive southward from Viborg.  \n\nInstead of providing top cover for the raiders as originally planned, we regretfully must ask you to do some flak suppression duty.\n\nThe AA has been heavy from Viborg south down the shoreline...especially around the enemy airbase.  It is vital that your flight knock out all AA guns as quickly as you can at the Rompotti airfield before the Finnish 152s and Pfeils arrive.  They will almost certainly be butchered if you don't do a thorough job.\n\nOf course, you will also have to watch out for enemy fighters.  The good thing is, the enemy has lost many MiGs in the last few days.  Come home safely!\n
