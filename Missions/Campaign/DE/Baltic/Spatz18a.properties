Description MISSION #18:  Morning at the Beach\n\nTIME:  0630\n\nWEATHER:  Poor visibility, with turbulence.\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nTaking advantage of the murky weather, the Soviets are attempting to evacuate troops onto ships north of Rojen (sector P-29).  We saw them too late; none of our ships are near enough to pounce on them while they are loading.\n\nWe are sending Me-262 bombers and some attack Pfeils to hit the ships and the enemy troops still on shore.\n\nWe don't expect much enemy air opposition in this weather, but be wary.\n\nIf you have a chance, go after any smaller water craft you may see, or do your best to stifle AA fire.  \n\nWhatever the case:  Always protect the bombers!\n
