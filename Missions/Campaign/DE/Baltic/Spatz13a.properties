Description MISSION #13:  Escort Attackers\n\nTIME:  1630\n\nWEATHER:  Hazy\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nAn uplifting newsflash from the Gulf of Finland!  The Finns have turned the tide against the Soviets near Hamina, and are now making their way east towards Viborg.  They are benefitting from our operation.  The Russians are sending forces towards us from the Leningrad area and thereby weakening their own ability to wage war in the far north.  Who knows?  Between the Finns and us, we might just be knocking on the doors of Leningrad one of these days.  The situation in the center and south remains tenuous for us, though.\n\nA major battle is underway on the coastal approaches to Riga.  If our panzers can drive through the Soviet forces before they can pull back, their defence of the city will be much weakened.\n\nThis afternoon you will escort Pfeils to an enemy staging area near Riga, just east of the major fighting.  Protect the attack planes!\n
