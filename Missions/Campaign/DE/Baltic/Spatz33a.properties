Description MISSION #33:  Attack on Kronstadt\n\nTIME:  0400\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162D\n\nYou aren't going to like this.\n\nAgain we are calling you to flak-suppression duty--in the middle of the night no less.\n\nThe airbase at Kronstadt is home to a significant number of I-250s and good Russian pilots.  We need to keep them busy with cleanup and repairs while the main force of our attack aircraft gets busy elsewhere this morning.\n\nAfter taking off at 0400 you will rendevous with attack Me-262s south of your airbase.  Stay well ahead of the bombers as you head to Kronstadt.  They will need you to keep the AA occupied as they arrive over their targets.\n\nGood luck and come home safely!\n
