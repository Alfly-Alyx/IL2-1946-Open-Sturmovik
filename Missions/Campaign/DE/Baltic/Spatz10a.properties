Description MISSION #10:  Ground Attack\n\nTIME:  0630\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nAIRCRAFT:  Ta-152C\n\nLOADOUT:  2 X SC 250\n\nThere's good news and bad.\n\nFirst the good:  During the night our Navy and Marines launched a major operation at Riga.  Everyone is excited, because so far the operation is proceeding well and it looks like we'll be making forward progress again.  On another happy note, it has been confirmed:  we will soon be receiving new "C" models of the He-162.\n\nThe bad news is, nearly all our poor old "A" models were destroyed last night in a raid on our base.\n\nRegardless of our losses, we can not waste any time.  All available planes have been ordered to fly to the front to support our ground forces, as the fighting hangs in the balance.  For the best pilots among you, it means you'll be behind the stick of a Ta-152 for the next couple of days.\n\nWe have loaded our remaining Ta-152s with bombs.  Your job is to stop enemy supply convoys from reaching the front line at Akmene, where heavy fighting is underway.  \n\nFly across the line into sector H-21 in enemy territory and destroy enemy convoys and/or tanks on the main highway.  Tanks should be your first priority.  Don't let them reach the front line!  Good luck!\n
