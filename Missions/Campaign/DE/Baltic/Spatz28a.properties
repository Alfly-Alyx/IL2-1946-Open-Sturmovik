But now you have to get into the air as quickly as possible.\n\nWe were going to hit them this afternoon, but it seems the boys from Rompotti are going to pay us a visit first.  They'll be here within a few minutes.\n\nGet as many planes as you can into the sky.  Shoot down our guests.  Good luck!\n
