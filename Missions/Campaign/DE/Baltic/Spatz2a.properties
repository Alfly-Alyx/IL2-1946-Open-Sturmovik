Name Spatz2a
Description MISSION #2:  First Blood\n\nTIME:  1315\n\nWEATHER:  Cloudy, with turbulence.\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162A\n\nIt's confirmed:  you'll be leaving for Kurland within the next few days.\n\nYou're a good pilot with experience shooting down Russian planes.  So before you leave, we have  one more job for you.\n\nA Soviet recon plane has been scouting the airbases in our territory for the past several days.  You could set your watch by him.  He's given us the slip several times.\n\nGain altitude quickly upon takeoff.  He flies at about 6000 meters and generally approaches our base from the west, on his way back to his base.  Take Blobaum with you--it'll be a good first taste of battle for him.  Don't let him kill himself.  We don't know whether the Russian is armed.\n\nIt's one of these hybrid rocket contraptions the Soviets have been using.  They drop their tanks and turn the rocket on when you chase them.  \n
