Description MISSION #14:  Protect Our Ships\n\nTIME:  0910\n\nWEATHER:  Hazy\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nThere has been a lot of enemy traffic in and out of Riga by the northern coastal approaches to the city.  Our battleships are effectively putting a stop to it.\n\nSince sunrise, the Soviets have been sending waves of bombers to attack our warships.  They'd be lucky to score a strike from the altitudes at which they're coming in--but the danger is real.\n\nLead your flight on patrol over Riga.  Protect our shipping from enemy bombers!  Schwalbe fighters will precede you to the target.  Be careful over the ships--their gunners are "generalists."\n
