Description MISSION #20:  Escort Recon Plane\n\nTIME:  0710\n\nWEATHER:  Clear\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nWelcome to the approaches to Leningrad!\n\nSInce you've been gone, Bruckner's kill count has passed yours and he has become a very tiresome person to be around.  If a Russian doesn't shoot him down soon, one of our boys might accidentally unload some 30mm shells into his tailpipe.  We hope you put him in his place quickly.\n\nOur land forces are preparing to take Narva and Kingisep in a head-on offensive.\n\nSoviet bombers and fighters based on the islands of Lavansaari and Seiskari (see map) have been making things difficult for us as we gather our forces.  We plan to take the islands as part of our offensive, but it is vital that we know exactly what kind of resistance our marines will face.\n\nThis morning we are sending a recon plane over the islands.  You and your wingman must protect it, and make sure the precious information it gathers returns intact!\n
