Description MISSION #19:  Attack on Windau\n\nTIME:  1100\n\nWEATHER:  Hazy\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nCongratulations!  You have reached your last mission in Kurland.\n\nThe Soviets, having concentrated their power in the central and southern fronts, have shown caution and indecision in the north.  We are now on our way up the Baltic coast towards Estonia.  After some rest and relaxation, your next assignment should see you on the approaches to Leningrad.\n\nOur surprise northern thrust, along with the Finns' grim determination to inflict punishment upon their invaders, has kept the Soviets off balance and has had the effect of slowing their progress in the center and south.  A stalemate situation is developing on those fronts.  We can expect the going to get tougher for us as we approach Leningrad.\n\nThe airbase at Windau has become the enemy's last hope of escape from the north Kurland encirclement.  They are loading everyone and everything they can on Douglas transports, and suffering staggering losses as they try to fly through our defenses.\n\nToday you will escort attack Pfeils to the airbase.  Our ships, which have been pummeling the base for days, have been ordered to stand off while the Dorniers attack.  Your job is to protect the bombers over the target.  Don't let them out of your sight till you're back in our territory.\n\nIf you have the opportunity, use your cannons on ground targets or enemy transports.\n
