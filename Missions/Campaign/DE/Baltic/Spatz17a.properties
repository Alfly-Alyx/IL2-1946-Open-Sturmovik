Description MISSION #17:  Wolves among Sheep\n\nTIME:  0500\n\nWEATHER:  Good\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nThe Russians are trying desperately to fly supplies to their isolated troops within the encirclement.\n\nIt is always risky for you to fly at night, but observers have spotted a large formation of unescorted enemy transports on a trajectory which should take them just south of your base.  The opportunity is too good to pass up.\n\nFly south with your wingman towards Doblen and attempt to intercept the transports.  They will be coming from the east.  You will fly into an area of heavy ground fighting.  Be wary of enemy (and friendly) AA!\n
