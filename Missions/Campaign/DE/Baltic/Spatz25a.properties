Description MISSION #25:  MiGs Over Vjipuri\n\nTIME:  0600\n\nWEATHER:  Poor\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162D\n\nAfter three bloody days, the Russian troops on Seiskari have finally waved the white flag.\n\nTo the north, the MiG fighter group based at Rompotti has been causing our Finnish allies a lot of trouble.  We can not have them ruling the skies up there, especially as the Finns are gearing up for a risky frontal assault on Vjipuri (Viborg).\n\nThis morning, Ta-183s will fly a sweep towards Viborg.  You will accompany the Ta-183 pilots who, for the most part, are new to our theater of operations.  \n\nWe hope you will show up nice and bright on the radar, so the MiGs come up and fight you.  Destroy as many as you can!\n
