Description MISSION #21:  Clear the Sky Over Narva\n\nTIME:  1710\n\nWEATHER:  Clear\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162C\n\nThose sturmoviks really made a mess of our base.\n\nSounds like you and Blobaum got a lucky jump on those MiGs.  Our pilots down south have warned us:  the MiGs haul ass once they get going.  They aren't quite as agile as the Yaks, but it doesn't matter.  They'll come down on you like a thunderbolt if you aren't watchful.\n\nOur forces have begun a massive assault on Narva.  Enemy attack planes have been making hit-and-run strikes against our troops on the battlefield throughout the day.\n\nYou will be leading two flights to Narva.  Clear the sky of any enemy aircraft you meet.  Good luck!\n
