Description MISSION #32:  Hammer and Sickle\n\nTIME:  1115\n\nWEATHER:  Clear\n\nAIRCRAFT:  He-162D\n\nThe situation in the central and southern fronts has deteriorated into trench warfare, with the Soviets firmly in control of Eastern Europe and half of Austria.  For our part, we hold the entire Baltic coast, in various depths,  from northern Poland all the way to Leningrad.  Our winter supply lines are operating beautifully...but how long before the Soviets mount a major attack in the north?  Time is playing into Stalin's hands.\n\nIn the center and south, both sides are employing new weapons of terrible power.  Grim reports of poison gas casualties are increasing. \n\nOn our front, Leningrad is now virtually encircled.  Its unfortunate citizens are reliving the nightmare winter of five years ago.  This time, however, disease is taking a heavier toll.  \n\nAs in '41-'42, Stalin seems to care little for the common Leningraders' fate.  The brave people continue to hold out with fatalistic determination.  Their factories continue to pour out weapons.  However, captured Russian soldiers say that there are rumblings of discontent throughout the northern armies.  Stalin is no longer god up here.\n\nToday we are starting a push along the southern coast towards Terijoki.  We are encountering strong resistance in sector BE-13.  The enemy is sending monster Stalin tanks from Terijoki to bolster the defense.\n\nDorniers are on their way to stop the tanks.  Take off and rendevous with the Pfeils just south of your base, over the frozen sea.  Protect the bombers over the target!\n
