Name Kurland '46
Short Kurland '46\n\nA JG54 campaign in a fictional 1946 scenario.\n
Description REPORT\nLocation: Memel airfield\nDate: September 14, 1946\nTime: 1630 hours\nType: Combat Air Patrol\nWeather: Partly cloudy, some fog patches\nPreflight: 2xTa-183 (Default)\nMission Altitude: 5000m\n\nBRIEFING\n\nThe Kaiser has personally sent us a congratulations on our last series of operations.  II/JG54 has distinguished itself as a top unit in the war against the Soviets.\n\nSoviet level bombing campaign has slowed significantly and there have been a 50% reduction in attacks on our cities and industry.  It's always nice to know that our work in the field is having results at home.\n\nUnfortunately we've lost many of our friends in recent weeks.  We will not forget them.\n\nOur new objectives are a series of combat air patrols (CAP).   Each pair will be tasked with patroling along our lines or venturing into enemy territory.  Our objectives are to look for enemy fighters and attack them whenever the situation is in our advantage.  Avoid uncessary combat where the advantage is not ours and we will continue to score success against the enemy.\n\nAlthough many of the Russian jet fighters we've fought have been inferior to our own, several new types have appeared and are significantly better than our previous experiences.  Be wary of these new fighters!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Fly the patrol route\n- Engage and destroy enemy jet fighters and other targets of opportunity\n- Return to base\n
