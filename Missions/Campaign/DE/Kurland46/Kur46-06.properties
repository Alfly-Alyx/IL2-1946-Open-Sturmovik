Name Kurland '46
Short Kurland '46\n\nA JG54 campaign in a fictional 1946 scenario.\n
Description REPORT\nLocation: Windau airfield\nDate: September 29, 1946\nTime: 1650 hours\nType: Bomber Intercept\nWeather: Partly cloudy, some late day fog, light winds\nPreflight: 2xTa-183 (4x X-4 rocket)\nMission Altitude: 8000m\n\nBRIEFING\n\nOur last mission was a success but some of our facilities were heavily damaged at Memel.  We've been issued new orders and have moved to the base at Windau.  The airbase here has recently been retaken from the Soviets and our engineers have worked overtime for several days to get the field ready for our arrival.  Accomodations are spartan at best but these thigns matter little compared to the importance of this next mission.\n\nThe Russians are increasingly warry of sending their bombers towards our lines.  As a result they are spending more time over Riga forming up before heading towards Germany.  Our mission this evening is to intercept the Tu-4's before they head out on their mission.  The idea is to create havoc within the bomber formation before it even has a chance to set out on its mission.  If we're successful tonight it may convince the Soviets to give up or reconsider their bomber missions over German airspace.  Even a delay in their operations may provide us the window we need.\n\nWe're scrambling several aircraft to take on this mission.  II/SG3's Dorniers are already airborne and are enroute to a nearby Ivan airbase where fighters that could be launched to intercept your mission are stationed. II/SG3 will disrupt their operations and shut the base down.  Meanwhile I/JG3 is on a mission over enemy territory to draw their fighters away from the bomber formation.\n\nIf all goes well it will be II/JG54 up against the bombers with an assortment of X-4 and R4M equipped aircraft.  Make the best use of your weapons, hit the bomber formation and take down as many bombers as possible before your return to Windau.\n\nGood luck!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Climb to 8000m and fly to Riga\n- Intercept Tu-4 bombers over Riga and destroy as many as possible before they can head off towards Germany\n- Return to base\n
