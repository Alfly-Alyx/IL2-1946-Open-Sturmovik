Name Kurland '46
Short Kurland '46\n\nA JG54 campaign in a fictional 1946 scenario.\n
Description REPORT\nLocation: Memel airfield\nDate: September 8, 1946\nTime: 1500 hours\nType: Bomber intercept\nWeather: Overcast\nPreflight: 2xTa-183 (4x X-4 wire guided rockets)\nMission Altitude: 7000m\n\nBRIEFING\n\nCongratulations!  Your previous mission was a huge success.  Unfortunately, success comes with consequences in war.  The Soviets have taken note of our technique due to the high losses sustained during your last encounter.  They have shifted tactics and we've lost two of our own on the last bomber intercept.\n\nRadar has once again detected a stream of Tu-4 bombers up over Riga.  Your objective is to climb to altitude and intercept the enemy.  Heavy fighter escort is expected and for this reason I/JG3 is now scrambling their Heinkel jets to intercept.  If you can, ignore the fighters, and go straight for the bombers.\n\nIf the Soviets continue to sustain high losses it may cripple their ability to operate over German airspace.  The Kaiser has directed that our highest priority is the safety of Germany's cities and we must work towards that objective.  Your jets are loaded with X-4 rockets.  Make good use of them once again!\n\nGood luck!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Climb to 7000m or higher\n- Intercept Tu-4 bombers near Moscheiken\n- Return to base\n
