Short Kurland '46\n\nA JG54 campaign in a fictional 1946 scenario.\n
Description MARKINGS\nSelect RRG_JG 54.bmp as your default skin with markings set to ON.\n\nREPORT\nLocation: Memel airfield\nDate: September 2, 1946\nTime: 0900 hours\nType: Bomber intercept\nWeather: Partly cloudy\nPreflight: 2xTa-183 (4x X-4 wire guided rockets)\nMission Altitude: 7000m\n\nBRIEFING\n\nI'd like to welcome our new replacement pilots into Jagdgeschwader 54. As all of you are aware, our standoff with the Soviets has erupted into full scale war for the second time this decade.  \n\nWe've reorganized our defensive line near Moscheiken and Telsche.  So far our frontlines consist of mostly light armor units and panzerfaust divisions.  Although we've lost significant territory in the first weeks, the front line has now stabilized and we're making progress in striking at the enemy.\n\nLuftflotte I has been called into action in the Kurland area.  Stab/JG54 is still equipped with Kurt Tank's ultimate propeller fighter, the Ta-152C, and their duty has been to defend the airfield from enemy air attack.  The Soviets know that our jets, just like their jets, are vulnerable on takeoff and landing.  I and II/JG54 are in the process of trading our old Focke Wulf's for brand new Ta-183 jet interceptors.  The Ta-183 is equipped with a new type of weapon we call the X-4.\n\nX-4 rockets are wire guided and require our pilots to position themselves behind an enemy bomber formation to guide the rockets to their targets.  Use this new weapon well and try not to waste them because we have a very limited supply for now.\n\nI'd love to go into further introductions gentlemen but time is short.  The Soviets are using their newly captured fields at Riga to launch a day and night bomber offensive against Berlin, Frankfurt, and surrounding areas using American designed B-29 bombers that the Soviets call Tu-4's.  Although the Soviets have been relatively unsucessful at night, their daylight bombing has inflicted serious losses on our industry, not seen, since early 1943 with our fight against the Allies.\n\nAs the Soviets are currently unaware of JG54's deployment, we're going to hit them where they suspect it the least.  Their Tu-4's are being escorted into German airspace by a combination of escort fighters, however, they are relatively undefended on their initial journey.  Intercept the Tu-4's near Schaulen and use your new weapons against them.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Climb to 6500m or higher\n- Intercept Tu-4 bombers near Schaulen\n- Return to base\n
