Description Day1  April 16th   1945   3.15am \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n\n  General Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front (2BF)  has moved west to the east bank of the Oder river. During the first two weeks of April the Russians performed their fastest Front redeployment of the war. General Georgy Zhukov concentrated his 1st Belorussian Front (1BF) which had been deployed along the Oder river from Frankfurt in the south to the Baltic, into an area in front of the Seelowe Heights.\n\n  The 2BF moved into the positions being vacated by the 1BF north of the Seelowe Heights. While this redeployment was in progress gaps were left in the lines and the remnants of the German II Army, which had been bottled up in a pocket near Danzig, managed to escape across the Oder. To the south, General Konev shifted the main weight of the 1st Ukrainian Front (1UF) out of Upper Silesia north-west to the Neisse River.\n\n\n On the northern flank of the Seelowe Heights stretching to the coast ,The 2BF had 8 armies consisting of 33 rifle divisions, 4 tank and mechanised corps, 3 artillery divisions, and a mixture of more artillery and rocket launcher brigades. The front had 951 tanks and self-propelled guns, and 6,642 artillery pieces.\n\n  The 1BF had 11 armies consisting of 77 rifle divisions, 7 tank and mechanised corps, 8 artillery divisions, and a mixture of more artillery and rocket launcher brigades. the front had 3,155 tanks and self-propelled guns, and 16,934 artillery pieces.  .\n\n\n On the northern flank  facing the 2BF, the German III Panzer Army had 11 divisions, 212 tanks, and practically no conventional artillery but between 600 and 700 anti-aircraft guns (some of them 88mm which were very effective anti-tank guns). \n\n The German IX Army covering the front which stretched from about the Finow canal in the north to Guben in the south and included the Seelowe Heights, had 14 divisions, 512 tanks, 344 artillery pieces and 300 to 400 anti-aircraft guns.\n\n\nGeneral Gotthard Heinrici replaced Himmler as commander of Army Group Vistula on March 20.\n\n  He was one of the best defensive tacticians in the German army and immediately started to lay defensive plans. He (correctly) assessed that the main Soviet thrust would be made over the Oder river and along the main east-west autobahn. \n\nHeinrici decided not to try to defend the banks of the Oder with anything more than a light skirmishing screen. Instead he arranged that his engineers fortify the Seelowe Heights which lay about 48 meters above the Oder and overlooked the river at the point where the Autobahn crossed it. He started to thin out the line in other areas to increase the manpower available to defend the heights.\n\n German army engineers turned the Oder's flood plain, already saturated by the spring thaw, into a swamp by releasing the waters in a reservoir upstream. Behind this they built three belts of defensive emplacements which reached back towards the outskirts of Berlin. The last line of which was known as the Wotan position 10 to 15 miles behind the front line.\n\n These lines consisted of anti-tank ditches, anti-tank gun emplacements, and an extensive network of trenches and bunkers.\n\n There was to be no expected serious Luftwaffe support in these dying moments of the Third Reich...\n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n With Galland's help we have secured the only operational twin engined push/pull fighters in the German inventory,the Dornier 335 Experimental heavy fighter,and yes your request for personal colouring and markings has been approved,at this late stage of the war i see no difference it can make.\n\n We have set this air unit up in a wood west of Berlin with the pick of the remaining aa units and ground servicing personnel.You, with your exceptional combat status and proven leaderships skills have been entrusted with these potent machines to,as our great Fuhrer put it, 'wipe these Russian machines from the air!" ...we know as hardened veterans that the Luftwaffe is a broken and spent force .It will never again be what it was in the days of victory,that is all behind us....the Fuhrer has brought destruction and misery to our country but we must play our cards right if we are to survive.\n\nOur mission today is to bring down the twin engined recon aircraft that crosses the Oder front every morning between 3.30 and 3.45 am,two weeks and it has never been challenged ,but with General Heinrici expecting the Russians to storm forward today ,we can deny them at least any aerial pictures of his last 24 hours of ground preparation.\n\n You are to take off at 0315 so as to be over the Seelowe area by 0325 .Climb to 7000 + metres  as the Russian normally starts his straight run at around this height.Get in and out quick ,once the AA has you your chances of survival will be very low ,the russian aa force in the area is tremendous,i have placed my hope in you for this mission as it will grant Heinrici at least a slim chance of knowing some of positions prepared in the last 24 hours will surprise the Russian attack.\n\n When taking off make sure you use your taxiing light and follow the Half-track to the autobahn ,all obstacles have been removed for a long enough take off and landing run but be sure to watch the trees on either side,we could not clear too much as to make our position obvious.\n\n When you land taxi back up into the wood so we can service your machine for a quick turnaround,we expect today will be a busy one for all..\n\n Salute Mein Herren.\n
