Name Bridge strike
Short Take out the Russian bridging position\n
Description Day1  April 16th   1945   4.45am \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n  Starting on the night of 12 April, the Red Army sent out battalion-sized units to probe German defenses, gradually escalating the probes and backing them up with artillery barrages. Everyone on both sides knew the storm was coming within days.\n\n   At 4:00 AM on 16 April the storm broke, with Zhukov's forces hammering on German positions in front of the Soviet bridgehead at Kustrin, on the west bank of the Oder, with 10,000 guns and 400 Katyusha barrage rocket launchers. Within a half hour, a half-million shells had fallen on the German Ninth Army.\n\n  The thunder was audible in Berlin.\n\n  The bombardment was noisy and spectacular but not very effective. Heinrici had anticipated it and quietly pulled the bulk of his troops back from the front lines to defenses in the rear. There were two lines of defenses in front of the heights and a very solid line of defense with mortar pits and antitank gun positions on the top of the Seelowe Heights, rugged high ground well behind the front lines.Desperate and in some cases deliberately suicidal attacks by Luftwaffe pilots against the Red Army's bridges over the Oder proved largely futile\n  \n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n \nThe attack is underway! Heinrici's headquarters has just cabled us that the expected bombardment is striking all across their front and the Russians are attempting to bridge the Oder.\n\n  Armed with a single bomb each , yourself and one other experten must try and take out this crossing,and at least slow the Russian advance.Heinrici is well dug in and says he can hold as long they are concentrating on the flat ground in front of the heights,but if they get their Tank divisions across, Seelowe will fall ,and the way will be open to Berlin.\n\n Stay low and fast all the way while this morning fog holds and use the Heights as cover from the flak. \n\n We must try and provide some time for our desperate troops on the ground.\n\n Our time has come for the beginning of the final battle gentleman.\n\nSkin Flecktarn\nLoadout - SELECT\n\n \n
