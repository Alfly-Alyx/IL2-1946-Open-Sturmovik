Description Day1  April 16th   1945   6.50pm \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n \n\n mid-afternoon, in an attempt to hurry things along, Zhukov ordered armored forces to the front. Chuikov was horrified, since he saw that would create a hideous traffic jam.\n\n  That was exactly what happened....\n\n    ..with vehicles immobilized while Red Army troops at the front continued to be chewed up by the Germans. \n\n  The confused state at the front also led to Red Army units suffering more than the usual share of casualties from misguided Soviet attack aircraft and artillery batteries. However, the Soviets did make some progress, helped by air strikes that destroyed much of Heinrici's heavy artillery on top of the heights, and the Germans were taking serious casualties themselves.\n\n   This was not much consolation to Zhukov, who in his own turn had to endure being cut down to size by Stalin during a conversation over radio that evening: Koba taunted Zhukov with Konev's success to the south, demanded results, and then cut off the conversation abruptly.\n\n  By early evening an advance of almost six kilometres had been achieved in some areas, but the German lines remained intact. In the south the attack by the 1UF was keeping to plan. Zhukov was forced to report that the Battle of the Seelowe Heights was not going to plan. Stalin, to spur Zhukov, told him that he would give Konev permission to wheel his tank armies towards Berlin from the south.\n   \n  \n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n  \n   Our armies on the Oder still hold!\n\n  Despite horrendous losses on our side the Russian artillery bombardment has made the Heights a better defendable area .Heinrici expects to still hold on and to even defeat this offensive force if our favourite Corporal releases the men he wants , Heinrici is not confident in that   ;)\n\n Your engine has been replaced which is a miracle considering the conditions, but at best we have three maybe four days worth of premium fuel for only two of our planes here.\n\n This early afternoons 234 recon has passed over the front and spotted a nose to tail jam of at least three armoured divisions west of Kustrin.Maybe Adolphs scorched earth policy worked for once as the bridges that can take this column are all out on his order .\n\n  This was two hours ago, but , if the info is correct there is no way they could have passed that many vehicles over one damaged bridge,even with our engineers ;) \n \n\n   Leave just on dusk and try to come in out of the dying sun.Every minute we can give to the boys on the ground are critical,i know you understand why we must fight on ... we all have family in this hell. \n\n Fly well my friends. \n\n \n \n \nSkin Flecktarn\n
