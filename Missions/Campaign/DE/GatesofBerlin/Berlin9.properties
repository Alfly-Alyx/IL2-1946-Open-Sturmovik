Description Day2  April 17th   1945    6.52pm\n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n \nA short respite from the Russian attacks in the late afternoon gave the Germans some time to pull out wounded and move some badly needed Panzer units into the front line.\n\n The Heights were still a thorn in the Russian front and were frustrating Zhukov in his attempt to be the first in Berlin as the Southern attacks were slowly gaining momentum.\n \n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n \n  Now at Eberswalde-Finlow  you realise how really badly strung the Luftwaffe is.\n\n  Using a village street to take off in one of the deadliest planes built!At least we have plenty of flak protection and enough munitions for a few days as soon as our ground crew arrives.\n\n  On dusk you will strike the most forward Russian airfield.\n\n Convoys of trucks and forward personnel have been moving towards the airfield on the Russian side of the Oder all  afternoon, our trusty Ar234 has seen the first of the Russian forward fighter and bomber units landing.Maybe we can hit them before they are ready for an attack.\n\n \n\nSKIN\nDo335_NJG1_G9+HX.bmp\n\n\nLoadout - 8xsc70\n
