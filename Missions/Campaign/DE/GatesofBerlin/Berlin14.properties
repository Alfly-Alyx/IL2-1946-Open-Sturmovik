Name Day Four
Short The end of the battle\n
Description Day4  April 19th   1945   3.00am\n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n \n\n  On April 19 , the 1BF broke through the final line of the Seelow Heights and nothing but broken German formations lay between them and Berlin.\n\n The remnants of the IX Army which had been holding the heights and the remaining northern flank of the IV Panzer Army were in danger of being enveloped by elements of the 1UF, these were the 3rd Guards Army and the 3rd and 4th Guards Tank Armies, which having broken through the IV Panzer Army turned north towards Berlin and the 1BF. \n\n Other armies of the 1UF raced west towards the Americans. By the end of the 19th the German eastern front line had ceased to exist. All that remained were pockets of resistance.\n\n The cost to the Soviet forces had been very high,  33,000 dead, 12,000 Germans lost their lives during the four days of the battle.\n\nThe defensive line on the Seelow Heights was the last major defensive line outside Berlin. Following April 19, the road to Berlin (90 kilometers westward) lay open.\n\n Many German units fled towards the western front in hope of escaping the Russian encirclement around Berlin... \n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n\n \n\n  I couldn't tell you this until it was official.\n\n You are too take the Dornier and meet the Americans! They have agreed to meet you above Orienburg at 7000 metres.\n\n An escort of  fighters will take you to an allied held airstrip in the West and accept you as a prisoner of war.You must pull up on the airstrip and taxi over to a waiting transport plane.They have promised you will be treated fairly taking into acount the handing over off the Do335.\n\n They have orders to bring you down if they suspect any tricks and request you fly unarmed.\n\n The rest of us ground huggers will fall back to Berlin and see where our luck falls.The war is finished ,but some of us need to be here for the rebuilding of Germany.\n\n Get that plane to the allies my friend and maybe,just maybe, we meet after the war.\n\n Salute.\n\nSKIN\nFlecktarn night.bmp\n\n \n\n
