Name       *Gates of Berlin 
Description A Single Player Campaign based on the Seelowe Heights/Oder Front battles\n\n\n=+= IMPORTANT=+=\n\n\nYou must select the highest rank possible.\n\nYou will be piloting the Do335ao,a large single seat fighter which you will be using to takeoff from small cleared forest strips.\n\n\You will need to engage a 'wider wing' mind set,forget the nimble 109s and 190s,this machine is big.\n\nThe campaign is based around the actual groundfighting occurring in April 1945 just East of Berlin,the last great battle between the Russian and German armies.The Luftwaffe facing 10-1 odds,poor fuel and poor supply are  forced to fly from Autobahns and forest clearings.\n\nDespite having the fastest Jet and piston engined planes of the time, defeat looms over the Thousand Year Reich.You are an ace, tasked with flying in the time of this battle.\n\nThe Dornier is fast and heavily armed but not a true dogfighter,keep your speed and rely on no-one but yourself for survival, make it your mission to come back in one piece.\n\n\n Salute and enjoy :)
