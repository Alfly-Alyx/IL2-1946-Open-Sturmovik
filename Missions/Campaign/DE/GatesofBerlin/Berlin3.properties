Short \u0020Sturmo Attack\n
Description Day1  April 16th   1945   6.55am \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n \nThe initial attack by the 1BF was a disaster even though the bombardment was followed up by massive air raids into the German rear.\n\n Because the Soviets had failed to correctly identify the dug-in and camouflaged defensive line along the Seelowe heights, the Germans were able, for a time, to halt the juggernaut. Heinrici and General Theodor Busse, the commander of IX Army which was the army holding the heights, anticipated the attack and withdrew their defenders from the first line of trenches just before the Soviet artillery obliterated them.\n\n   The light from 143 searchlights which it was planned would blind the defenders was diffused by the early morning mist and made useful silhouettes of the attacking Soviet formations. The swampy ground proved to be a great hindrance and under a German counter barrage, Soviet casualties were enormous. Frustrated by the slow advance, or on the direct orders of Stalin, Zhukov threw in his reserves, which in his plan were to have been held back to exploit the expected breakthrough...\n   \n  \n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n  \n  Heinrici has withstood the the first attacks and his men are still in place blunting the Russian Storm.\n\n He can do nothing though against the might of the Russian aircraft attacks and has called for any help we can give.Sturmos and other ground attack aircraft are repeatedly hitting his forward positions which are taking a pounding.I have scraped up two of the latest D9 interceptors to escort your two craft to the Heights ,they will attempt to keep any fighters in the area off you, but, as you know the Russian air superiority is complete,that is something you must deal with.\n\n Identify any ground attack aircraft and strike fast ,set your approaches up from two points to divide the flak and use your speed to get out of the area . Make sure you don't get tailed back to base,this is basically our last well defended position,if we are found here the Russian or American bombers will make this place a living hell.\n\n Salute! \n\n \n \n \nSkin Flecktarn\n
