Description Day2  April 17th   1945   9.00am \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n \n The German defense of the Seelowe Heights began to erode the next day, 17 April, with the simple size and weight of the attackers chewing up the defenders and eroding holes in their lines.\n\n Desperate and in some cases deliberately suicidal attacks by Luftwaffe pilots against the Red Army's bridges over the Oder proved largely futile. Such damage as they inflicted at the cost of their lives was quickly made good.Heinrici wanted to counterattack, using 30,000 troops then stationed in the town of Frankfurt-on-Oder to the south . \n\n These troops were in immediate danger of being encircled by Konev's First Ukrainian Front, which was moving forward rapidly. He needed these soldiers to halt Konev's advance so he could focus on Zhukov. However, Frankfurt-on-Oder had been designated as a "fortified place" by the Fuhrer, and though Heinrici called to request permission to use these troops, Hitler turned him down flat..\n   \n  \n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n \n The night has brought little change to the front ,but the Russian storm of attack is unrelenting.They have over 20 points of crossing on the Oder and artillery is still pounding all of Heinrici's positions on the Heights, in Seelowe and 'Festung Frankfurt',pah!Fortress!Just like all of the other so called Fortress's' that have swallowed our men and denied our  armies  free movement.\n\n Just thinking about the waste of men and material...bah,i must think of the good men we have here...like you,and the pitiful attack just phoned through.\n\n 14 109 and 10 D9 jagd bombers were to attack the artillery positions on the Oder at daybreak today but the russians hit them on the ground as they were arming.Three flyable planes remain and will be passing over in minutes,three planes!Whatever we hope to achieve besides suicide is beyond me,but we must try and cover these poor men as best we can.\n\n Provide cover - but if you are overwhelmed get your ass out of there,better to fly another day than die on this suicide run.\n\n Salute lads! \n\nSKIN\nFlecktarn\n
