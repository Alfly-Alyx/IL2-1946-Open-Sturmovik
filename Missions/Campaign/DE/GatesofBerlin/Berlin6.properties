Description Day2  April 17th   1945   3.00pm \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n \n On the second day, the 1BF staff were reduced to combing the rear areas for any troops which could be thrown into the battle. The Soviet tactic of using massed attacks was proving more costly than usual. \n\n  By night fall of April 17, the German front before Zhukov remained unbroken, but only just. To the south Army Group Centre under the command of General Ferdinand Scharner were not proving such a hindrance..\n \n  IV Panzer Army on the north flank of his formation was falling back under the weight of the 1UF Attack. He kept his two reserve panzer division in the south covering his centre, instead of using them to shore up the IV Panzer Army. \n\n This was the turning point in the battle because by nightfall the positions of both the Army Group Vistula and southern sectors of Army Group Centre were becoming untenable. Unless they fell back in line with the IV Panzer Army they faced envelopment. \n\n  In effect, Konev's successful attacks on Scharner's poor defences, to the south of the battle of the Seelowe Heights, were unhinging Heinrici's brilliant defence.\n\n The Luftwaffe was facing odds of more than 10 to 1 in the air and nearly every airstrip was untenable... \n   \n\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n \n Alarmstart!!Russian planes have just overflown one of our flak nests a mere 2 miles away!!.\n\n Shake the lead out!!\n\nSKIN\nFlecktarn\n
