Description Day3  April 18th   1945   6.35pm\n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n \n Late that afternoon the Russian pressure started to swamp Heinricis men and was pushing gaps through his defences,Seelowe was taken and the Gates to Berlin were crumbling.\n\n The Southern Flank had collapsed and was retreating, leaving behind nearly all of their armoured units and artillery which were irreplacable.\n\n The Northern flank was also dislodged and the push was truely on towards Berlin.Heinrici's stand against enormous odds was nearly over and Germany had nothing left to throw into the battle. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------\n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n\n\n   Word from the front is bad but not unexpected,the Russians are coming.\n\n Before nightfall we want you to do a highspeed run over the immediate front and tell us how long we have.Everyone here is getting ready to head back to Berlin and hopefully make our way towards the West.\n\n There is a lot of Russian air activity so if you cannot get through to the front airspace safely do not risk yourself or the plane,we have plans for you and the aircraft tomorrow.\n\n Salute my friend.\n\nSKIN\nFlecktarn night.bmp\n\n\n
