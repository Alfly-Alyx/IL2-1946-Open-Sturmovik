Description Day2  April 17th   1945   4.30pm \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBackground\n\n--------------------------------\n \n The afternoon brought no respite for either side,the Russian attacks were not gaining any substantial ground but the Germans were taking casualties they could ill afford in material they could not replace.\n\n  Heinrici still commanded the heights but was looking toward his South with dismay as the reports came in of more successful attacks in that region.\n\n  The Luftwaffe had made brief appearances during the day but were overwhelmed by the Russian air force in its sheer numbers.Ground attacks behind the lines by Russian fighters and fighter bombers at anything that moved were making it nearly hopeless to get airborne.   \n   \n \n--------------------------------\n\nTHE MISSION\n\n--------------------------------\n \n We must move with what we have , or we will have nothing,that attack has ruined us here , get your plane to Gatow ,only 2 miles away,were the last of our high octane clean fuel will be loaded for you.\n\n Pull up and rejuice on the runway then fly out to our last undetected airstrip East of Berlin.It is dangerously close to the front ,less than 15 miles, so flight times by the Russians into your area will be less than 5 minutes.\n \n Take the Night prepped Dornier as we can not have your damaged machine  flying until tomorrow.If we can get this done i will have it flown to you first thing.\n\n Hope to see you there myself tomorrow my friend.\n\n Salute\n\n\nSKIN\nDo335 njg1 g9+hx.bmp\n
