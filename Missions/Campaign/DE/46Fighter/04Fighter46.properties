Description Back to the Ivans. \n\nDate: May 11, 1946\n           0500\nWeather: Thunderstorm\nCloud Base: 900 m\nLocation: Mihalovtsze\n\nWith rifled pointed at my head, I raised my hands and slowly, very slowly, slid back the canopy. \n\n"Don't shoot. I'm German."\n\nMy voice quivered. Some of the stern faces under the helmets began to register surprise.\n\nA kuebelwagen zoomed towards us, and almost crashed into the plane, showering everyone with liquid mud. An officer in a raincoat jumped out, his pistol pointed at me. Suddenly I thought I recognize the face. The officer did a double-take and squinted.\n\n"Kurt?"\n\nI smiled, closed my eyes, and lowered my hands.\n\nThe little airfield at Mihalovtsze belonged to JG300, a Reich defense unit, now moved to the East, towards the only threat we still had. Ive met three people I used to know: Otto Lewe and Heinrich Drexler from the old days at JG 51, and Willi Dornberger, my old instructor back at the flight school. Otto was the Geschwaderkomodore.\n\n"I want to hold back on reporting this thing up the chain." Otto said after we sat down together. "There's a lot of rabble up in Berlin now. Who knows what they'll do to you. Three years in captivity is no laughing matter. They'll probably drill holes through you, trying to make sure you're not a spy."\n\n"And there I was thinking I'd get a medal for brining you that very ugly plane."\n\n"Well, that may be the case." Otto laughed. "I'll hold on to it for a few days, think it over."\n\n"And what am I going to do?"\n\n"Stay as our guest until I have better ideas."\n\nI chuckled. "Maybe I can just apply to Berlin to replace my papers, pretend I was never captured."\n\nOtto laughed, and then grew serious and scratched his chin.\n\n"Maybe that's not such a bad plan."\n\nThen I slept for almost 48 hours.\n\nThe news I've learned in the next few days were overwhelming. So it wasn't just Russian propaganda. Hitler was dead; the western Allies were out of the war; there was an armistice with the Russians. It looked like we came out of this war all right after all, despite all the naysayers. We kept all of the Western Europe, and got a large chunk of the East.\n\n"You want to fly a few sorties?" Otto asked.\n\n"Sorties?"\n\n"Sure. I thought your idea over, and I think its a winner. I'll send back a few reports mentioning your name, write you in a few previous ledgers, maybe even recommend you for some phony commendation or something. They'll begin to wonder who the heck this Leutnant Kugelmann is, I'll wonder back, and that's how we'll establish that they've lost your entire record."\n\n"Maybe I should just take the name of some recent KIA?"\n\n"We don't have many of those nowadays. It's peacetime, remember?"\n\nI nodded.\n\n"We'll get you started next week. Now, I have orders to reconnoiter the airfield at Bzhozuv, the one you just escaped from. I figured, to do it best, tomorrow at dawn we should use that Russian plane. They won't shoot at it. You want to show Willi the ropes, explain how to fly that crate?"\n\n"Better yet, how about I fly it?"\n\nOtto raised an eyebrow.\n\n"And what if they shoot you down and capture you right over the body of that mongoloid?"\n\n"Now that would be very funny, wouldnt it?"\n\n
