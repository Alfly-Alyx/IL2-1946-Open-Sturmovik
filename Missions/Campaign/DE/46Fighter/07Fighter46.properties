Description Back for Seconds.\n\nDate: June 22, 1946\n          0907\nWeather: Haze\nCloud Base: 800 m\nLocation: Mihalovtsze\n\nA sickly staff adjutant, Meier or something, ran up to my plane as I was taxiing in to park and started motioning me towards the fuel truck. I turned around, and he jumped up on my wing, holding down his service cap. \n\n"Sir!" He tried to scream over the whine of the engine. "That was a great job you did over there. We got a phone call from some general or something. They want you back over there as soon as you can. There's Russian artillery up on the hill, across the border, and it's really killing them."\n\n"Sure, I can do that!" I smiled widely, finally back in my element. "Strap on a few heavier ones, and I'll be..."\n\nThe adjutant looks confused.\n\n"But sir, the Salamander can't carry bombs."\n\nNow it was my turn to stare at him.\n\n"You mean, I'm to fly over there and... And what exactly?"\n\n"Strafe them, sir."\n\n"Verdammt! In this piece of crap? Whose orders are these? Otto's?"\n\n"No, sir! Colonel Lewe has been called back to HQ. I took the call from the infantry general, and..."\n\n"You idiot!" The youngster blushed. "What the hell are you doing ordering missions like that? You... I... Verdammt! Did I see some FW-190s parked around here?"\n\n"Yes sir."\n\n"You have ANY bombs on this airfield?"\n\n"Yes sir."\n\n"Then prep the damn butcher bird, and get some of these cherries to cover my ass. Goddamn idiot moron kids running things these days, back in '41 you'd get your asses..."\n\nI continued cursing during the entire time the mechanics scurried to ready an old FW-190F.\n\n
