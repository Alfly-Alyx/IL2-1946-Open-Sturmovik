Three years in captivity, and I was still strong enough to work. Yes, being captured was unlucky, but even there luck smiled at me. If my suitcases weren't stolen three years ago, I would have flown in my regular uniform, medals including, and the Ivans would have paid much closer attention to me. After I was passed down the line on that first day, no one any longer remembered that I was an airman. In my stained feldgrau, I mixed in with the rest of the infantry. They sent us wholesale to dig ditches. And if my luck would hold today, it was possible that my three years of shit were over. \n\n"Davai-davai, faschist schwien, three minuten to eat."\n\nI jumped up, grabbed my digging bar, and began striking the ground with twice the normal speed. Today I especially didn't want to get my head bashed in. It was raining, the sides of the trench kept caving in, and we had only put up one section of the fence since the morning. But it didn't matter. I just didn't want private Salnaglychev to keep looking in my direction. \n\n"All right, pigs, crawl out, eat."\n\nWe all said "spasibo", stood up, and saluted the private. The greasy Mongoloid smiled, exposing crooked yellow teeth, and motioned us towards the pot. We all gathered around, fighting for the few pieces of meat. Salnaglychev smiled even wider.\n\nThere were dozens of airplanes parked around the airfield. There were twelve of us. Salnaglychev was alone. He only had one old bolt-action rifle. The visibility was 50 meters. The Russians were usually not afraid of us escaping: there were whole divisions stationed around the airfield, all within sight. But not today. Today the rainstorm covered our cozy little tea party from all prying eyes.\n\nPrivate Salnaglychev sat a fair distance away, his back turned to us, his head and mess tin covered under his rubberized waterproof. \n\nI picked up my digging bar and looked at my pals.\n\n"Forgive me, kameraden. I do regret that I can't take any of you with me. If they had some transport planes, maybe all of us would have been going. But I just cant wait for another chance like this."\n\nEveryone stared at me in surprise.\n\n"Forgive me."\n\n"What are you..."\n\nI was already running. I knew that these men would all be shot, but I had no choice. Just a few meters more. The kameraden were still stunned; none of them figured out yet that their only chance to survive was with Salnaglychev, that they had to betray me. \n\n"Haaaalt!"\n\nScheisse...\n\nSalnaglychev turned around majestically, and the digging bar hit him in the left eye before surprise could fully reflect on his face. With a moist crunch the bar slide inside and crashed through the other side. This was easier than digging. Salnaglychev exhaled, and folded to the side. \n\n"Halt! Alarm! Alarm!" they shrieked behind my back.\n\nI spurted towards the blast pen. The Russians would hear, but they wouldn't understand what was going on in time, they wouldn't know where to react, they wouldn't expect any of us to know how to fly. I still had a minute or two.\n\nA weird stubby plane stood by the hangar. I dragged the canvass off and unlatched the canopy. I kept sliding off the wing, and by the time I finally got inside, the bucket seat was filled with cold water. I really hoped I'd be able to start the engine. If the Russians were like every German pilot I knew, the would have flipped every switch to the Off position after landing. I frantically switched on everything in sight, and an electric motor came to life with delightful whine. The needles began to quiver. Now, lets see what this baby can do.\n\n
