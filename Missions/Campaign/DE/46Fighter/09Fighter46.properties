Description Attention: in the Loadout screen please select the "RRG_JG 300 A.bmp" paintscheme for your aircraft, and make sure the "Markings On" option is ON.\n\nBack to Berlin\n\nDate: August 29, 1946\n           1317\nWeather: Poor\nCloud Base: 1500 m\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\nAfter repulsing the Soviet bomber raid, I got out of the cockpit and suddenly felt weak. I held on to the side of my He-162, and noticed a clean bullet hole through the side of the cockpit. I looked myself over, and saw a dark splotch on my left hip, growing fast. The ground seemed to shudder, and then it tilted upwards and hit me in the face. Everything turned black. \n\nTrying to open my eyes was painful. The sun hit them like a searchlight. By the time I could look around again, I realized that my hip was bandaged, and I was lying in bed. I was in a hospital. I sighed and closed my eyes again, going instantly back to sleep.\n\nRecovery took three weeks. I finally got my discharge papers on July 17th. They said "JG 300 - Berlin - Fuerstnwalde". I got another shock. Was I assigned to a desk job? \n\nI reported to my assigned address three days later, and was glad to find that it was an airfield. Familiar shapes of the Volksjaegers were parked next to the hangars, but entirely unfamiliar ones, round and stubby, flew overhead. One of the soldiers at the gates drove me to the CP in a captured American jeep. As we rounded the corner, I saw many more of those stubby planes hidden farther away from the landing strip. \n\nI knocked on Otto's door, and smiled when the familiar voice said "Come in". Otto looked up from his papers, saw me, jumped up, ran towards me, and gave me a big old bear hug.\n\n"So glad to see you, old friend! You're just in time. We've been recalled from the front lines, and are training to defend mainland Germany from Soviet heavy bombers. We're a Reichs Defense unit, after all. So we've just began conversion to a new aircraft type, the Ta-183. Come on; let's go to the flight line. I have something very nice to show you."\n\nFor the next month, the entire squadron trained on the new jet, and the awesome new X-4 rockets. The war continued somewhere far away. The initial Soviet advance generally failed; our counterattacks were also stopped, and no significant gains were made by either side. Both sides dug in and engaged in local skirmishes, while preparing for their next big offensive. \n\nEvery once in a while the Soviets did send formations of lend-lease American Superfortresses to bomb mainland Germany, but their raids could not match the size and accuracy of the US Army Air Force. The Soviets did not dare hit Berlin, and their fighters were far out of range. We were able to train as if in peacetime, undisturbed.\n\nBy mid-August our training intensified. Soviet offensive near Riga found a weak spot in our defenses, and Soviet tanks dug a wedge deep into our positions. Several airfields that fell into Soviet hands were only 800-some km from Berlin. Their escort fighters were now within range.\n\nFinally, during lunch today, our pimpled adjutant raced into the mess hall and announced:\n\n"Achtung! Squadron scramble! Early warning radar shows a large bomber formation heading into Germany. They are changing direction constantly, and in case theyre going towards Berlin, we're going up! Get to altitude and hold for further instructions."\n\n
