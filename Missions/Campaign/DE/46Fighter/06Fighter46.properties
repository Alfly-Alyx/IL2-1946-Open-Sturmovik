But I really don't like where this is going. The Russians are sending bombers deep into our territory all across the border, and wherever they're not stopped, they're bombing our defensive positions inside the demilitarized zone."\n\n"And we're bombing them back?"\n\n"No. The nancy boys in Berlin are too scared of the Ivan. They're screaming about peaceful intentions all over the radio, an keep pleading for President Truman to interfere. I got screamed at for hitting those Sturmoviks. Apparently the entire Europe would have been better off if you had let them bomb our troops."\n\nI sniffed. "I see."\n\nI spent the rest of the day studying the Salamander, and taking a few circuits around the airfield. I kept habitually checking the horizon for enemy planes, but none came. I pulled into my parking space as the sun was setting, and just then I realized I no longer had any fear. I was longing for war.\n\nAt 5 am the next morning, I got it.\n\n"Squadron, scramble! Wake up, wake up, men! Half an hour ago Russian artillery opened up on our positions, and a flying eye reports entire Red divisions crossing the front line. Willi, sector A. Kurt, sector B. Heinrich, sector C."\n\n
