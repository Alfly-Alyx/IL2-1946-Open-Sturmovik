Description No more combat.\n\nDate: August 29, 1946\n          2050\nWeather: Good\nCloud Base: 1,400 m\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\nA huge crowd was lined up next to the airstrip after I landed, cheering, throwing their hats up, and waving small bouquets of field flowers. Mechanics stood at the front, a bucket of paint and brushes at the ready, eager to paint the new victory markings on our planes. I was beaming from ear to ear. That'll show the Popovs! They won't go anywhere near Berlin after that kind of a display!\n\nWe celebrated for over an hour, and then that blasted Meier tapped me on the shoulder and led me away from the noisy crowd.\n\n"Sir, there's a phone call for you from Berlin, in Oberst Lewe's office."\n\nOtto's office was empty, the window was open, and papers were strewn on the floor, fluttering in the wind. The receiver was off the hook.\n\n"Hallo? Hauptmann Kugelmann here."\n\n"Good day, Hauptmann. This is Erwin Stahl with the OKL in Berlin. Congratulations on your victories."\n\n"Thank you, sir."\n\n"After getting initial word of your performance, we considered sending journalists to take your picture, but after we got the full report from Oberst Lewe we changed our mind." The man paused. "We want you to come to Berlin yourself. The Kaiser will personally award you with a long-deserved Knight's Cross. Tonight. "\n\nI was speechless.\n\n"Hauptmann. As of this moment, you are one of the highest decorated heroes of the new Luftwaffe, and have the highest number of kills scored in this new conflict. I have even better news for you, although you may not immediately agree with my assessment. As of this minute, you are forbidden from any more combat flying. You are being promoted all the way up to Oberst, and given the overall command of the entire Reichs Defense."\n\n"Sir?"\n\n"That's non negotiable, Oberst. Please have the exact plane in which you've repealed the bombers prepared for a flight, and head for Tempelhof. You will be expected there."\n\n"But sir, I..."\n\n"And if you should encounter any enemy aircraft, you are expressly forbidden from engaging them. Is that understood?"\n\n"Sir... Ah... Ja wohl, meine herr."\n\n"Hope you can find Berlin in the dark. We're still in blackout, but we'll turn on the runway lights for you. Good day."\n\nHe hung up the phone. I was stunned. This was... No, this couldn't be happening. This couldn't be final. If I had to go to Berlin, I would. Talking on the phone wouldn't change anyone's mind, but if I spoke to those people in person, spoke to the Kaiser, then maybe I'd be able to convince them to let me go back to JG 300, to my friends. I belonged here at the front.\n\nMeier looked at me incredulously. \n\n"Hauptmann? What is it? Is everything all right?"\n\n"No. Yes. Have the mechanics prep my plane for a ferry flight. I'm going to Berlin."\n\n
