Name Three weeks later.
Short Three weeks later.\n
Description Three weeks later.\n\nBoth my suitcases got swiped. Somewhere between Minsk and Gomel, while I slept on white sheets like a baby, some artiste managed to clean the entire compartment. The brand new Ritter Kreuz, straight out of the feldmarshal's hands, was gone; and so was my wallet, my watch, brand new leather boots, Soldbuch, and the rest of my papers. The bliss I still felt after the unexpected two weeks in Berlin vanished. \n\nThe fat chain-dog Leutnant looked like he would shoot me on the spot, screaming that I didn't even look like an officer, and I was altogether a partisan. Of course, with my uniform taken, I didn't look much like a hero shirtless, in my worn socks, and yellow-stained long johns. An artillery major, thank God, found a Signal magazine with my portrait, and the mustached pig shut up. The major gave me his old field blouse, a young tank commander spared his extra breeches, and the chain dog went away and came back an hour later, huffing and sweating, with a piece of paper that would hopefully grant me passage back to the airfield.\n\nThe geschwader got battered pretty badly while I was gone. Model, the frontschwein, kept throwing them all over the front, changing the targets, area of operations, goals, and commanders almost daily. He was short of tanks and artillery, so he plugged holes with aircraft. \n\nWhen I finally got to the right airfield, three days after my leave officially ended, the kameraden didn't even seem to notice. Most didn't look twice at my criminal stubble and the strange compilation of intra-service uniforms. I found most of the old gang gathered around a wonky table under a camouflage net. \n\nThe major looked up.\n\n"Oh, there you are. About time."\n\n"Yes, sir. I..."\n\n"Take up the second staffel. Meet the bombers over Shablykino at 0640. Good luck. "\n\nI sighed and walked to the bombed-out parking area, explosions rumbling in the distance. Many new faces were a good sign; it meant there'd be new planes too. But who could have thought that only three weeks of rest would weaken me by so much? I wasn't this scared even before my first solo. \n\n
