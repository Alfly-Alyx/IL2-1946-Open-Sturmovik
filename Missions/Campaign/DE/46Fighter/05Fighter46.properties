Description Attention: in the Loadout screen please select the "RRG_JG_300.bmp" paintscheme for your aircraft, and make sure the "Markings On" option is ON.\n\nAnd stay out! \n\nDate: June 21, 1946\n           0712\nWeather: Good\nCloud base: 1,100 m\nLocation: Mihalovtsze\n\nThe report I brought in was troubling. There were signs of the Russians build up all along the border. They couldn't think we wouldn't notice. Otto got on the phone right away, motioning me to leave his office. I stood outside next to the group about twenty pilots, noticing for the first time how much younger they all were. I was twenty-seven, an old man; most of JG300's pilots were in their early 20s.\n\nHeinrich, another aged veteran, tapped me on the shoulder.\n\n"So what's the story?"\n\n"The Russians are concentrating along the border. They're digging in all along the demilitarized zone."\n\nThe commotion around us subsided, and the squadron began to listen.\n\n"That can't be good. I said all along that we had to keep hitting them while they were down, not sign this stupid peace treaty."\n\nOne of the youngsters jumped in.\n\n"Hit them how, with what? We're lucky to get where we did! If we didn't sign..."\n\n"What would you know?" Heinrich grabbed the kid by the collar. "Were you at Vinnitsa? Were you at Kiev? We could have rolled right over them..."\n\nThe door opened, and Otto stepped out.\n\n"There have been skirmishes all along the front line all morning. Our ground units have just been ordered to move up into the DMZ, and to start digging in. The geschwader is ordered to step up flights throughout our operational area. We are to reconnoiter Russian positions along the front line, and not to allow any intrusions into our airspace. Any unauthorized Russian planes entering German airspace are to be considered hostile, and to be dealt with accordingly."\n\nThe crowd erupted in clamor, but Otto silenced everyone with a wave of his hand.\n\n"Heinrich, take a couple of boys towards sector A. Kurt, you're by now familiar with the Salamander. Have somebody give you a final look at the operating handbook, and when you're done, take a couple of flyers and patrol sector B. Show the kids how we did it back in '41."\n\n
