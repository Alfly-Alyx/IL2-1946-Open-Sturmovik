Description General Stolle.\n\nDate: June 22, 1946\n          1027\nWeather: Poor\nCloud Base: 600 m\nLocation: Mihalovtsze\n\nA group of staff cars was waiting for me when I landed. A door opened, and a monocled general stepped out, medals jingling under his heavy overcoat.\n\n"Oberleutnant."\n\nThe general clicked his heels and saluted me with his gloves. I saluted back and looked around. Otto was sitting in the general's car, smiling. I began to relax.\n\n"Sir! Reporting in from a mission over enemy lines, sir! Allow me to..."\n\n"No need, son." The general finally smiled. "Oberst Lewe told me all about you, and I'm glad to shake your hand. It takes a certain type of person to spend three years as a POW, and to immediately go back to serve his fatherland."\n\nThe general shook my hand.\n\n"Thank you, herr general."\n\n"Ja. My name is Stolle. I just flew in from Berlin to replace the idiot who's been running the Luftlofte before me. Now I'm taking a tour of the airfields." The general nodded and squinted at the horizon. "I must say, it's not much, but it's something. We're holding fast. Thanks in no small part to the Luftwaffe, the Popov's advance is stalling, at least in our part of the front. We need to keep flying as much as we can, and to keep the Russians at bay. I count on the veterans like you, Hauptmann, to lead this inexperienced squadron into battle."\n\nWas I just promoted? I was beginning to shake. The general smiled again. \n\n"Your ad lib strike mission was, if I may say so, inspired. The new OKL was shortsighted to invest in these fancy new planes. We don't have a single airfield in this area from which their new bombers can operate. You may have to repeat your stint in that battered veteran; but next time, won't you bring a couple of other 190s with you? Even you can't stop the Popov alone."\n\nThe air raid siren moaned and revved up to full volume.\n\n"Ah." The general smiled. "That's my cue. Looks like the Popovs followed you home."\n\n
