Description The bombers are coming\n\nDate: August 29, 1946\n          1458\nWeather: Poor\nCloud Base: 1,400 m\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\nI taxied to the hangars at break-neck speed, almost tipping over at every turn. Seeing my approach, the mechanics spat out their cigarettes, and jumped up.\n\n"Quick you monkeys, get to work! The bombers will be overhead any minute, and if they drop on this airfield, you'll get what you deserve for being so damn slow!"\n\nI climbed out of the cockpit and jumped up and down to stretch my cramped legs, and then I raced towards the operations building to look for that idiot Meier. I kicked the door open, and he jumped up to attention when he saw me. \n\n"Meier! Get on the radio right now, and bring the rest of the squadron down, to refuel and rearm."\n\n"Yes, sir." \n\n"Do we have any more planes and pilots available? Who are those morons relaxing over there?"\n\n"Those are our pilots, but we have no more Ta-183s available. All the Huckebeins have taken off, sir."\n\n"Get those kids into the He-162s. The entire squadron is going up."\n\n"Sir, but Oberst Lewe..."\n\n"I don't have time to discuss this with a committee! Otto would agree with me. Just get on that radio."\n\n
