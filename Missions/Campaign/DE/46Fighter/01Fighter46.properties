Name The eve of Battle
Short The eve of Battle\n
Description The eve of Battle\n\nWar... How it changes. After a while under this stress, your brain switches off, and the events fly straight through it and disappear into the mist.\n\nWhat day is it today? Tuesday? The month must be July, and the year 1943... Or is it August? Verdammt! Hope I didn't miss my birthday. I could have gotten drunk. \n\nWhere did we fly yesterday? Trying to recall brings no memories, just dull pain. Explosions, tracers, heat and dust, and a whirlwind of unreadable alien place names. Nothing else sticks in my head. Has this really been going on for two and a half years?\n\nI remember my first sortie better than this morning's breakfast. Blood-splattered clouds at dawn; exhaust fumes in the cockpit; big fat blotches of enemy planes in front of the crimson sun. I remember every maneuver, every hectic scream on the radio. I could still draw the region map in minute detail. Unlike now... What town is that under the left wingtip? Some -skoje?\n\nWeren't we here yesterday? That looks like where I bagged that red-nosed LaGG-5. Or was that the day before? I can't remember... Tomorrow I'll forget where I was today, just a vague memory will remain that today, yet again, I tried but couldnt remember anything.\n\nIf only fear could evaporate as easily as memories. Fear keeps sitting deep in my stomach, growling, growing. It only subsides when I fight; and it's at its strongest when I try to sleep. Won't I ever get used to this? It would seem that all those sorties, victories, awards, deaths of everyone but me, all that should have made me stronger, less sensitive, fashioned me into a super-soldier, going into battle with a smile... Did the warriors of old feel the same way? I'm like a wraith now, a twenty-four-year-old ancient wreck, an attachment to a flying machine.\n\n"Break, break, Popovs behind you!"\n\nAh, scheisse...\n\n
