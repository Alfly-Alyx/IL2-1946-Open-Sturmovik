Short Bridge Strike\n
Description Today we will fly a strike mission against targets to the south of Murmansk. Your flight will be hitting the railroad bridge. Flight 2 will be hitting the road bridge and flight 3 will attack a railstation.\n\nPrevious missions already hit targets in that area and the russians seem to be building up defences around it. The bridges are vital for them so expect relatively strong resistance.\n\nGood luck!\n
