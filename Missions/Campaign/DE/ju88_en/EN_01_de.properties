Name Ju88_DE_01
Short Attack on airfield near Murmansk\n
Description Gentleman,\n\nwelcome to the northern front! Today our campaign to take Murmansk begins. Our mission is to support our troops on their way to Murmansk, primarily attacking enemy airfields and providing our troops with close air support if necessary.\n\nToday we will attack the airfield at Vayenga. Primary targets are aircraft parked on the ground and any airfield installations of vital importance.\n\nOne flight of Me-110 will provide escort for today.\n\nEnemy Flak and fighters will be on the prowl, but it should be nothing compared to what we saw against England...\n\nGood luck!\n\n\nAttacks from high altitude (ca. 3000m) should be performed with dive bombing throughout this campaign.\n\nThe skin to be used throughout this campaign is "Ju88A4_east_winter".\n
