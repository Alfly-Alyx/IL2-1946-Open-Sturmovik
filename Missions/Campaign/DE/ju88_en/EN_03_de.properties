Short Rail Hunting\n
Description Today we are going out to hunt the russian "Murmahnbahn". The russian railroad moving supplies south via Murmansk is a vital element of the russian supply line. As such, it is a primary target for the Luftwaffe in the high north.\n\nProceed to the scheduled attack waypoints and attack any train you come across. Any targets related to the railroad are to be treated as secondary targets.\n\nGood hunting!\n
