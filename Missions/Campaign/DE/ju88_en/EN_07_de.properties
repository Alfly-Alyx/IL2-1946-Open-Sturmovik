Short Convoy Strike\n
Description Recon planes have just made out an enemy convoy heading for Murmansk! The threat posed by our battleships in the area, seems to have scared away their escort ships. Now they are just being protected by a few russian ships. This is our chance! Attack the convoy and sink as many ships as you can.\n\nGood hunting!\n
