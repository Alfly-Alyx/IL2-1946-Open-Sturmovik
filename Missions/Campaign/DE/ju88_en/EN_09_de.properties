Name Ju88_en_09
Short Murmansk Bahnhof\n
Description The last missions against the harbour at Murmansk went well. Now we must turn to our next target: the train station. Primary targets are parked trains and any relevant infrastructure.\n\n9 Ju-88s will take part on the strike mission. Comrades from the JG7 will fly cover. We can expect moderate Flak and plenty enemy fighters.\n\nGood luck!\n
