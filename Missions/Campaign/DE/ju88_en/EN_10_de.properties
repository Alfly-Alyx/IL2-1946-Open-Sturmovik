Description Gentleman,\n\nour time here has come to an end! But before we leave there is a last mission to accomplish. One of our recon planes has just discovered a russian military depot south of Murmansk. Our last available machines will fly a strike to take it out. Seems like the russians are trying to safe important material from our strikes on Murmansk.\n\nThere is no fighter cover available for this mission so you will be on your own. Leave the target area as fast as you can after bomb release and come back safely.\n\nGood luck!\n
