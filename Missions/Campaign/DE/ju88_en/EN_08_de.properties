Short Murmansk Hafen\n
Description Gentleman,\n\nour objective to take Murmansk has failed! The advance of our troops has come to a halt. Considering our situation we won\u00B4t be able to take Murmansk and can be happy if we get to leave this place in one piece!\n\nNevertheless the new situation brings us new targets. Since we are not taking Murmansk any more, we must destroy its harbour and ships.\n\nToday we will take care of this and attack the harbour. Primary targets are the docks and ships. 3 flights of the KG30 will do the job. The JG7 will fly cover.\n\nGood luck!\n
