Description July 7, 1940.\n\nToday our recce airplanes has spotted a British convoy going up the Canal, towards the East and Dover.\n\nWe have already sent some Fighters to sweep the skies, so that our Bombers can go in, and they have clashed with British Spitfires.\n\nABOUT YOUR AIRCRAFT\nI know that you are fully trained on the Messerschmitt Bf109E, but I just want to remind you of a few things.\n\nThe fuel-injected DB601 is very useful against the British Spitfires and Hurricanes, as the British fighters use gravity-fed carburetted engines, which cut out under negative g forces whereas the DB601 do not. The Bf109s thus has the initial advantage in dives, either during attack or to escape. \n\nThe Spitfire is the most formidable opponent of the two, being approximately as fast and able to out-turn the 109 at medium to high speeds, due to the Bf109's high wing loading. \n\nIn roll rates the Bf109 has the advantage at dogfight speeds, though at high speeds the manoeuvrability of all three fighters is severely limited. The Bf109 enjoys good handling near stalling speed. \n\nThe armament is also first rate, and superior to both British aircraft: two 7.92 mm MG17s and two 20 mm MG FF cannon. \n\nThe only real problem with the Bf109E is the relatively short range, limiting the effective combat time over British targets.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis is not strictly an escort mission, but what is called "Freie Jagd" - Free Hunting: the thing you fighterjocks like the best. You will do a Fighter sweep over that convoy and that part of the Canal. The aim is still to give the Bombers a chance to attack unmolested.\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the previous mission: in real life it was Do17Z's who attacked that convoy off Dover on July 4 1940. Hurricanes from 79 Squadron tried to intercept, but the escorting Bf109's from II/JG51 stopped them. At least one Hurricane was shot down. It was piloted by Sgt Henry Cartwright, DFM, a veteran who recently had won five victories during the Battle of France.\n
