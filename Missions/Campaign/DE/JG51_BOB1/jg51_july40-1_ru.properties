Description July 4, 1940\n\nSt Omer-Wizernes, the base of Jagdgeschwader 51.\n\nFollowing the evacuation of the beaten British from Dunkirk, and the French surrender less than two weeks ago, most of us believed the war was practically over and the British, defeated on the continent and without European allies, would quickly come to terms with us.\n\nBut there are no signs that the British are giving in - to the contrary. \n\nWell, then we must force them!\n\nThere has been little sense of urgency among our commanders, and among ourselves, when it comes to the task of subduing England. We are all a bit dizzy over all our recent triumphs, I guess, enjoying the warm summer weather and all the pleasures of France. Besides, we have to regain our strength after the Battle for France: victory came at a cost...\n\nYOUR ASSIGNMENT\nA couple of days ago came orders from G\u00F6ring and Luftwaffe HQ. We must prepare for an aerial campaign against England. The first phase starts now. \n\nThe goal for this first phase is to gain and maintain air superiority over the Channel, and deny the coastal waters to the British cargo shipping that is constantly plying these sea routes with coal and other types of cargo from north to south.\n\nNot less than three Luftflotten will participate, of which our junit, Jagdgeschwader 51, belongs to Luftflotte 2, the largest, based on aerodromes all over Belgium and Northern France.\n\nOn July 1 the very first attacks took place, with Stukas attacking a convoy near Plymouth. Today we will step up our effort. Already the naval base at Portland has been hit by Stukas.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nA small convoy has been sighted off Dover. Bombers will attack them, and our task is to escort those bombers, see that the enemy fighters cannot stop them.\n\nToday your "Kanalkampf" starts! Halz und beinbruch!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1. This mini-campaign has been designed to use this amazing map by Canon_UK. It never became more than a mini-campaign because there is a NEW version of this splendid map coming, and the whole campaign, that will feature the exploits of Jagdgeschwader 51 during the entire Battle of Britain, is waiting for that one! See this as a DEMO, if you like!\n\n2. If you want to fly in the same colours as your wing mates you will have to switch skins before flying, via the "Arming" / "Aircraft Customization" menu below.
