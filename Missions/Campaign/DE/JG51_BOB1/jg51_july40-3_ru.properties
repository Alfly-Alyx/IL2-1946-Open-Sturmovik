Description July 9, 1940.\n\nThe clashes over the English Channel continues. We think we have the upper hand, inflicting more casualties on them than they on us! This looks promising.\n\nSPECIAL INTEL\nWe now know that the biggest problem for the RAF isn't aircraft, it's pilots! With aircraft production running at 300 each week, only 200 pilots is being trained in the same period.Only about 30% of the available pilots are assigned to operational squadrons, many are involved in training, or assigned to staff positions! (RAF policy dictates that only pilots can make many staff and operational command decisions, even in engineering matters.)\n\nTheir pilots are often more unexperienced than ours, with little actual flight practice and often no gunnery training whatsoever, all compared to our "Experten", many of which has fought in Spain. \n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe have just had a report that British Bombers have hit an airfield outside Amiens. What cheek! Take your Rotte go up and fly south, see if you can catch them going home!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the previous mission: what happened in reality was as Bombers from KG2 arrived to attack the convoy just before dark, 64 and 65 Squadrons were scrambled, but a sweep by Bf109's from JG51 caught 65 Squadron. JG51 claimed to have shot down 10 Spitfires, but the actual loss was 3.\n
