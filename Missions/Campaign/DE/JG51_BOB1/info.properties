Name Over the Channel
Description Early July 1940. France fell for less than two weeks ago, but what about Britain? German air units are gathering their strengths at airfields all around Northern France and Belgium.\n\nIn this 4-mission mini-campaign you are German Fighter Pilot in Jagdgeschwader 51, flying the Messerschmitt Bf109E. Your commander is the famous ace Major Werner Mölders. You will soon participate in the first phase of the German aerial onslaught on England, focusing on gaining the air superiority over the English Channel.\n\nRegarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option. \n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have A.) The AAA Mod installed, B.) Canon_UK's map over the English Channel and the surrounding areas.
