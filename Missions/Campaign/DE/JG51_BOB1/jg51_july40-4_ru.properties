Description July 11, 1940.\n\nThe fighting over the Canal continues. The weather hasn't been too good.\n\nSPECIAL INTEL\nSomething about the British tactics: as you have seen RAF fighter pilots fly in vee-shaped sections of three. These restrict squadrons to tight 12 aircraft formations composed of four sections in another tight "V". With this formation, only the squadron leader at the front is free to actually watch for the enemy; the other pilots have to concentrate on keeping station.\n\nSome of our pilots talked about the RAF formations as Idiotenreihen ("rows of idiots") because they leave squadrons vulnerable to attack.\n\nOur system of the four aircraft "Rotte" is much better. We will surely win this. As well.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis is not a escort mission, but another "Freie Jagd" - Free Hunting. You will do a Fighter sweep over the area between Dover and Folkstone, and hopefully the Britishers will rise to the occasion. \n\nWe want them to.\n\nGood luck!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the final mission in this mini-campaign. It is only a small foretaste of what will come when Canon_UK's NEW English Channel Map will arrive! Hopefully it will be soon.\n
