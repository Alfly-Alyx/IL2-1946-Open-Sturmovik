Short Surprise raid on an RAF airfield.\n
Description Mid August, 1940\nJust off the English Coast\n\nToday we strike the RAF where they least expect it - at home, just as they are sitting down to dinner.You are to lead first and third flights on a daring hit-and-run raid on the RAF base near Portsmouth. You will be flying at 200m at 400km/h. Make one run over the base destroying anything that moves. Then break to the northwest and come around for one final run before making for home.\nDon't get caught up in any protracted dogfights - the Britischers have all the advantages. Remember - hit and run! If executed well we shall catch them on the ground and inflict maximum casualties. They'll never know what hit them!\n\n\n\n***AIRSTART***\n\n
