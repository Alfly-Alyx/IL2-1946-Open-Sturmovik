Name Luftwaffe Pilot_Battle of Britain11
Short Escort bombers on massed raid on industrial targets.\n
Description Mid August, 1940\nOff the coast of England\n\n"Achtung Staffeln! Hier ist Hauptmann Wick. Maintain altitude 6000m, speed 400km/h.  Our Heinkels are making for the factories that produce Hurricane fighters so the better they do their job, the easier our job becomes!\n\nWhen the RAF come up to challenge us, fend them off but don't pursue too far. Our mission is to protect the bombers. They are our strike arm and hold the key to subduing the Britischers to pave the way for our eventual occupation of these miserable islands. We must protect the poor bastards in the He111's. Stay with the bombers! That means you, Jedermann. \n\nOur base is one of the emergency landing sites for the 111's and judging by the amount of ambulances lined up at dispersal when we took off they're obviously expecting some casualties this time so keep those eyes open and call the fighters out when you spot them. Wick out." \n\n\n\n***AIRSTART****\n\n\n
