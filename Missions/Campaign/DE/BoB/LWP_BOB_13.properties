Short 110's escorted by your Staffel will conduct a low-level raid on RAF \nairfields.\n
Description Mid August 1940,\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I.e Gruppe\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nGuten Morgen,\nWell, Jedermann, today you will get a chance to play with the Luftwaffe's latest toy - the 109E/4-B- a specially modified variant that can carry drop tanks to extend its range or can carry up to 250kg of bombs. We have a flight here for service evaluation so make the most of them as we don't know when they'll be back, if ever. And don't scratch the paintwork - they're fresh from the factory!!\n\nIn line with the aims of the Adlerangriff strategy we are under orders to keep up the attacks on RAF bases and production facilities to crush RAF resistance. It's taking too long to destroy them air-to-air.\n\n110's accompanied by your 3.e Staffel will conduct a low-level raid on RAF airfields. \nStay with the 110's on the way into and out of the target. They will split and hit two airfields - Warmwell and Exeter. You are to accompany one group on their raid of Warmwell airfield. You'll be carrying a 250kg bomb - use it! Let's catch the Tommies napping!\n\nAll flights will go in low so as to evade detection on the Britischer radar. Once you cross the coast of Britain, climb to 200m, break west and hug the terrain on your way into the target. The airfield is some distance inland. Expect flak.\n\nGet in, hit your targets and get out. To achieve maximum surprise on this mission you will be going in without top cover. There may be friendlies in the area accompanying another diversionary raid so if you get in trouble use your wireless.\n\nAnd make extra sure of your ditching equipment. At 200m  flak hits hard as that new lad...what was his name...Winterer?... would tell you - if he he were still with us, that is.\n\nThe Britischers are in for a nasty surprise this morning!\n\nDismissed!To your machines.\n\n\nPaintscheme:BoF_standard_3\n\n
