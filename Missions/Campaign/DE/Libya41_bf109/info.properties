Name Battleaxe - Bf 109 Pilot
Description  This is a 10-mission static campaign portraying the fighting in the air over the Western Desert during Operation Battleaxe, in mid-June 1941. You are a Luftwaffe pilot in 7/Jagdgeschwader 27, newly arrived in Northern Africa and flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109E.\n\nThe aerial fighting in this Theatre of War during the summer of 1941 is interesting, as it was the last period characterized by clear Axis dominance. After this the German and Italian pilots were slowly but surely losing the control of the skies to their ever stronger Allied counterparts.\n\nRegarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option. Also if you feel confident enough choose the "No Map Icons" option as well. It will give a MUCH more intense game. Regarding rank: start as "Kapitän".\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have the AAA (All Aircraft Arcade) Mod installed. And the "Libya N-E a.k.a. Tobruk" map by JV69_BADA, also available on AAA.
