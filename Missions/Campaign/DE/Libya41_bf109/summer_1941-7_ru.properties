Description Morning, June 16 1941.\n\nCounterattack!\n\nAt dawn, the Afrika Korps 5th Light Division began to advance southwards past the western edge of Hafid Ridge against Sidi Omar! Soon it will engage the British Armoured Division standing in the area (we believe it's the 7th).\n\nAt the same time the 15th Panzer has started moving against Fort Capuzzo and Sollum.\n\nOnce again we are on the move!\n\nStrictly between us: our main concern is still logistics. Someone just heard General Rommel complaining at a briefing about our low petrol stocks, adding "we know that our moves will be decided more by the petrol gauge than by tactical requirements".\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe attack of the 5th Light Division is the most crucial move in this whole battle. It is of utmost importance that the enemy air units are not allowed to attack our brave comrades down there on the ground. \n\nKeep up an aggressive fighter patrol over the operations area of the 5th Light Division. Attack all enemy aircraft you can find! \n\nMore fighters from our unit will join you en route.\n
