Description Early Evening, June 15 1941.\n\nThe heavy fighting at the front continues.\n\nThe British advance towards Sollum continues, and Fort Capuzzo has just fallen. \n\nAt the same time the most crucial position, the Halfaya Pass, still holds, despite the British attacks. One of our Panzer Batallion, aided by some Italian infantry, hold their ground with utmost heroism and opferbereitschaft!\n\nThe situation is serious, but we all feel confident in our Germans arms and the skill of our commander. \n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe brave defenders of the Halfaya pass needs all the support we can give them. \n\nThe British has been strafing them all morning, using some new variant of the Hurricane, equipped with cannons. (Don't go head-to-head with that one!) Your mission is to patrol over the Halfaya Pass, and stop any enemy attempts to attack our ground positions!\n
