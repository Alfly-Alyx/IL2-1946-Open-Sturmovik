Description Gazala, North Africa. Early June 1941.\n\nWell done on that patrol! We have Intel telling us that the enemy pilots are pretty unexperienced, while most of us have long battle experience, not least from the Battle of Britain.\n\nABOUT YOUR AIRCRAFT\nI know that you are fully trained on the Messerschmitt Bf109E, but I just want to remind you of a few things.\n\nThe fuel-injected DB601 is very useful against the aircraft that is the main enemy fighter, the Hurricane, as the British fighter use gravity-fed carburetted engines, which cut out under negative g forces whereas the DB601 do not. The Bf109s thus has the initial advantage in dives, either during attack or to escape. \n\nIn roll rates the Bf109 has the advantage at dogfight speeds, though at high speeds the manoeuvrability of both fighters is limited. The Bf109 enjoys good handling near stalling speed. \n\nThe armament is also first rate, and superior to the  British aircraft: two 7.92 mm MG17s and two 20 mm MG FF cannon. But note that the enemy is now using a new version of the Hurricane, equipped with cannons.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nOur Intel is suspecting that the British is up to something. They launched a small and failed offensive last month, but we know that they have since received even more reinforcements, both in men and materiel. Perhaps they will try and strike against us before we strike against them?\n\nAnyway, we need to find out more. Therefore a photo equipped Bf110 will fly over the British lines south of the Halfaya Pass, to see if they can spot any signs of a build up. \n\nYour task is to protect that recce aircraft. Don't fail. This is important.\n
