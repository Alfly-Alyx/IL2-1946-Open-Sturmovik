Description Mid day, June 15 1941.\n\nYes, the British are attacking! Their goal is obviously the important Halfaya pass, but they also try to encircle our positions at the coast by attacking through the desert.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe want you to make another aggressive fighter sweep towards the Halfaya Pass, where furious ground fighting is now raging. If we can win air superiority our bombers can hit the attackers,and then they are doomed!\n\nMind you: an Italian fighter unit is also patrolling the area, so watch out so you don't shoot down any friendlies!\n
