Description Morning, June 17 1941.\n\nWe are advancing!\n\nOur commander Rommel, who last afternoon personally witnessed several of the armoured engagements out on the western flank, has decided to attempt a full thrust against the enemy out there. \n\nAt 16:00 yesterday he ordered the 15th Panzer Division to leave only minimal elements at its position north of Fort Capuzzo and make all haste to the northern flank of the 5th Light Division which was pressing eastward to Sidi Suleiman and on to Halfaya!\n\nWe hope to completely cut off the majority of the British forces, encircling and then eliminating them!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe want you to perform an aggressive fighter sweep over the front, and especially over the area where the 5th Light Division and the 15th Panzer is now charging.\n\nYour task is to stop enemy air units from helping their ground units, and attacking ours. You will also clear the skies for our Stukas, that will strike there soon.\n\nMore fighters from our unit will join you en route.\n
