Description Gazala, North Africa. June 15 1941.\n\nSomething is happening at the front!\n\nHeavy artillery fire and attacks by Allied aircraft seems to indicate that the enemy is about to attack. The concentrations seems particularly heavy around the Halfaya Pass - that seems to be the schwerpunkt.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe want you to make an aggressive fighter sweep over our front lines close to the coast. Attack all enemy aircraft that you can find. Bombers and Ground attack aircraft are a priority!\n\nAfter the attack you will NOT return to Gazala, but land at a small forward airstrip close to Burdiyah, close to the front line.\n
