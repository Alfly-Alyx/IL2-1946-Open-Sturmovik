Description Late afternoon, June 17 1941.\n\nThe British are in full retreat!\n\nBut the big encirclement we hoped for will perhaps not materialise.\n\nOur Panzer divisions are pushing vigourosly towards the east, but has run into a hastily formed screen of armour and heavy artillery. They are trying to protect the enemy units that were fighting at Sollum and Halfaya Pass that are retreating, no, fleeing towards the east.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe want you to perform an aggressive fighter sweep over the front, from Halfaya Pass inland to the current Battleground, where the 5th Light Division and the 15th Panzer is now attacking.\n\nAttack all enemy air units you can find! Enemy ground attack Hurricanes have been pestering our advancing panzers all morning.\n
