Description June 18 1941.\n\nThe enemy offensive is over, and it has been a stunning victory for the German and Italian arms!\n\nAlthough the big encirclement that our general Rommel played for did not materialise, the British are really beaten now! \n\nLet me mention only this: the British have lost some 100 tanks, either in action or by mechanical breakdown. It is correct that we have lost roughly 50, but we now control the battlefield and are therefore able to recover all disabled vehicles, Allied and Axis alike, for salvage and repair. In the end, our real losses will be minimal - while the Allies won't get any of THEIR tanks back.\n\nIn terms of aircraft, the British have suffered considerably higher losses than the Luftwaffe and the Italian forces. I have not the precise figures available right now, but for every aircraft we have lost, they have lost three!\n\nWith the British forces defeated and with no available reserves, Egypt lies wide open to us. \n\nIt is only our critical supply position - the panzers have exhausted most of their petrol - and the continuing threat in our rear from that damned Tobruk garrison, that prevents us from charging headlong towards Alexandria!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe want you to perform a fighter patrol over the battleground. Some enemy fighter-bombers have been harassing our troops that are salvaging tanks and other AFV's from the battlefield.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the final mission in this campaign.
