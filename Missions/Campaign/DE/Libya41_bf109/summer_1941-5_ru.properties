Description Afternoon, June 15 1941.\n\nThe British offensive rolls on. Our troops are holding them at the Halfaya Pass, but they have penetrated our lines inland. One of their spearheads are racing towards Sheferzen, another is driving on Fort Capuzzo.\n\nThe situation is serious, but not critical. Not yet.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nEnemy bombers have flown several sorties against our troops that are being rushed to the Sheferzen penetration. The ground commanders are crying out for air protection!\n\nAnd you and some Bf110's will provide it!\n\nWe want you to make a Fighter sweep over the bulge near Sheferzen, and attack any and all enemy aircraft that you can find. Bombers are a priority!\n
