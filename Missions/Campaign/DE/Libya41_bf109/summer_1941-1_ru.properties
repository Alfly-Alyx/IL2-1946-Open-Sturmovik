Description Gazala, North Africa. Early June 1941.\n\nAs you have just arrived here in Libya, I think I must first brief you and the other newcomers on the general strategic situation.\n\nIn late March, soon after the arrival of our Afrika Korps in Tripoli, our commander General Erwin Rommel, though ordered to remain on the defensive (and against the express advice of our hard pressed allies the Italians) quickly captured the British front line position at El Agheila. \n\nWe then went on an offensive which, by mid-April, has reached as far as Sollum, Egypt. The sole remaining Allied position in Libya is the heavily fortified port of Tobruk, which we have surrounded and placed under siege. The Allied response has until now been restricted primarily to harassment by the RAF.\n\nWe are not ready to resume our offensive, not yet. The reason is logistics. We must first gather enough supplies to do so. I'm afraid we're having big problems getting them safely over the Mediterranean - it's that damned Malta! But just you wait: soon...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYes, our main problems is not the heat or the dust or the flies. Instead it's spelled logistics, logistics and logistics. Some of our most essential supplies are flown in with Tante Ju's from Sicily.\n\nToday we expect more of these airborne shipments. We want you to make a fighter patrol to the east, just in case, to stop any prowling British fighters.\n\nStay clear of Tobruk! The encircled defenders have a lot of AA guns, and if you linger too long over that area you will be shot down.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1.
