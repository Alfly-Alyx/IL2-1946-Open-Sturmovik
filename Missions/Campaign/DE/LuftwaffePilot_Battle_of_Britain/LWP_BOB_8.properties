Short Rendezvous with a flight of returning Ju88's from KG54.  \n
Description Early August, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I Gruppe base\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nGuten Tag, Jedermann, \nIt's been a hectic few weeks, I know, but today's mission is simple. You and our young ace, Schalk, are to head out over the Channel and rendezvous with some  Ju88's. They were shot up a little over England and the sight of some friendly aircraft will be a big boost to their morale. Link up mid Channel at the point marked on your flight map and escort them back over French soil. Once that's done, return to base as soon as possible. They will be at 2000m.\n\nIn the unlikely event of ditching, radio your location and one of the floatplanes will be on the spot quickly to fish you out. Check your parachute, Mae West, marker flares and inflatable raft just to be on the safe side. Even in a summer like this, the waters of the Channel are no place to be. \nEmergency ditch sites that are frequently patrolled are in grids C-12, E/F-10 and K-7. There may be an E-Boat or floatplane in the vicinity if you're lucky but don't count on it. And as always, keep a close eye on your fuel guage. \nOh, and before I forget, take it easy at the mess tonight - both of you. This battle is starting to take its toll on all of us and the way you two carry on every night has to be wearing you out. We need you as sharp as possible every mission. So let off steam, by all means, but look out for yourselves at the same time. Jedermann, the other pilots in the squadron look to you for guidance and advice so we cannot afford to lose you to some careless accident like the one that got... what was his name...Meissner...Mueller...Christ, there are so many - Bergmann! Ach, ja. Bergmann,  that was his name! Don't let yourselves become just another half-remembered name, okay lads?  Okay, get out of here. Dismissed.\n\n
