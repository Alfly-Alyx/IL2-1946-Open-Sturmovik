Description Ealry August, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" 1.e Gruppe,\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nGuten Morgen, \nWell, I must say you are all looking surprising chipper, considering the early start and \nthe state some of you were in last night. Sad to have lost another young flyer, but Schalk would have been proud of the send-off we gave him. He will be remembered.\n\nToday's mission is very straightforward. Jedermann - you are to lead three flights from 3.e Staffel on a Freijagd over Tangmere airfield. You will link up with two Schwarme from JG 26.  Your purpose is to lure the RAF up into the skies to be destroyed. Once their fighter strength is depleted, we will have air superiority over the Channel so our Landsers can make the trip across in safety. \nJedermann, with first flight, you will go in at 2000m as bait.  Gold flights two and three will follow at 4000m. Once first flight engages the enemy, flights two and three are to join in and close the trap. JG26 will be covering us the whole way.\nAttack any and all targets of opportunity but avoid  unneccessary risks. Expect the airfields and port facilities to be heavily protected by flak. And by this stage in proceedings the Tommy gunners are getting damned good.\n\nOur comrades in the nearby Wehrmacht base are conducting a live firing exercise today so if you see flashes or explosions that's what it will be. They're proabbly getting set for the drive up to Buckingham palace in a few weeks!\n\nCheck ditching procedures as usual and remember that the grid references are on your flight maps. Radio your location before ditching otherwise the rescue crews have the Devil's job finding you, even if they are almost on top of you. I'm sure we all remember what happened to poor young Schalk. And Jedermann - before you open that smart-arse mouth of yours - no, I wasn't involved in the paintscheme decision. Experience has shown that quick ID saves lives in dogfights -hence the yellow noses. You know how I feel about it so get lost!\n\nGood hunting .\n\nHeil Hitler \n\n*********************************\n\n Paintscheme:HS_109E4_BoB_HelmutWick_NM\n
