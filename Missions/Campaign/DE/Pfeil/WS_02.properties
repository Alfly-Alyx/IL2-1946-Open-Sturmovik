Name Caruso 259
Short Practice Fighter Intercept\n
Description Date: November 3rd, 1945.\n\nTime: 15:04 Hours.\n\nWeather: Good with Scattered Clouds at 1400 meters.\n\nLocation: Brandenburg-Briest\n\nWelcome to JG 400. Today you will make your first operational sortie with your new aircraft and practice your interception technique. Sighting in an Do-335 is very different from what you are used to with the old 109 or 190's, so get used to the fact that you need to think before you blink.... At the speeds you will be traveling, all you have to do is look away for a moment and you will find yourself ramming your target instead of shooting at it.\n\nThis is the time of day we're normally between raids, so there shouldn't be much around. Go and see if you can find someone friendly to play with....\n\nMaintain your altitude around 3000m where you will be able to see some old Me-410's on a training flight. Oh, by the way.... try not to scare them too bad!\n\nGood luck....\n
