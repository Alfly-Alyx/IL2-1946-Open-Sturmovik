Name Gustav-Dora
Short Fly to your new assignment\n
Description Date: November 4th, 1945.\n\nTime: 13:17 Hours.\n\nWeather: Rain and heavy cloud base at 800 meters.\n\nLocation: En Route to Lager-Lechfeld\n\nThis afternoon we will be moving to the main airfield at Lager-Lechfeld. We will not be able to stay there very long, so this will be your new base for a day or two until we can finish our "Secret" Autobahn Base just outside of Georgenburg. After arrival, find your temporary quarters, but make sure you are ready to leave on short notice at all times. The Allied bombers somehow manage to find us wherever we go and we must conserve our strength to fight back with as much force as possible when we get the opportunity.\n\nThe weather has taken a turn for the worse so be careful not to get lost or crash into one another!\n\nThese very few 'Pfeils' fighters you are entrusted with are almost the only thing standing in the way of the total destruction of the Fatherland......so if you want to see your fraulines and families again, get them there in one piece!\n\n****THIS IS AN AIRSTART MISSION****\n      \n\n
