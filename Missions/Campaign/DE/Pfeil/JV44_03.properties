Name JG 400 Berlin 3
Short Catch the Jabos....\n
Description Date: April 6th 1946.\n\nTime: 11:37 Hours.\n\nWeather: Good with Clouds at 1000 meters.\n\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nYou will take off this morning on a Frie Jagd fighter patrol. The Freya Radar located here just to the north of the field has noticed sporadic low level activity which we believe to be more enemy "Jabo" raids. Their fighter-bombers have been attacking our airfields at will for the last week and we can not continue to hide our own fighters in the trees while they fly overhead unhindered! The decoy aircraft we have placed on the ramp should prevent them from locating our dispersed aircraft, but we must not rely on that alone. They will eventually realize that they are fakes if their gun cameras are as good as we think they are.\n\nHurry and get your Ketten of 2 Arrow's airborne before the enemy fighters arrive and do what you can to prevent any more damage to our airfield.\n\nGood luck.....\n\n
