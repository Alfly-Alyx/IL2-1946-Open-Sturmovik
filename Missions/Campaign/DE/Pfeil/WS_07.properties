Name Abandonment
Short Fly to your new home\n
Description Date: November 5th, 1945.\n\nTime: 17:12 Hours.\n\nWeather: Poor with cloud base at 1000 meters.\n\nLocation: Lager-Lechfeld.\n\nListen up everyone, we don't have much time so I will make it quick....\n\nThe enemy Jabos have found us here and we must leave as soon as the aircraft are rearmed and refueled. After what happened a few hours ago, we cannot stay here any longer! I want you to take what's left of your flight and go to "Bavaria Eine". This is the secret landing strip we have set up hidden in the forest for just such a situation as we are now in. You will land on the Autobahn which runs though the forest and hide your Schwalbes in the revetments we have set up under the trees. The landing area is within Map Reference "L-2". Just to make sure you'll find it, they will light both ends of the runway for you, but be quick about it.... they won't leave the lights on long and we don't want to get caught again like we just did here!\n\nThe weather is closing in and it's forecast to snow within the next 24 hours, so keep your eyes peeled for the base.\n\nGood luck, and I will see you all there shortly.\n\n
