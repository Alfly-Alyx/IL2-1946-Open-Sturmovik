Name Jet Fighter Training
Short Check out ride in the Me262 jet fighter\n
Description Date: October 24th, 1945.\n\nTime: 10:00 Hours.\n\nWeather: Cloud at 500m.\n\nLocation: Achmer.\n\nWelcome to Erganzungs Kamfgeschwader 2.\n\nYou have had sufficient time to study the manual on the Pfeil twin prop fighter, so it is time for your checkout flight. We do not have any 2 seat trainer versions as they have all been deployed as night fighters, so your first flight will be solo. You will take off and circle the airfield and then return to land.\n\nWe have also placed some contaminated jet fuel in a few old rail cars at the location marked on your map if you would like to test fire your guns.  There is no doubt that you will be doing it quite often, but it would be best to know what to expect as early as possible. \n\nThat is it, good luck and we will see you back here shortly.\n\n
