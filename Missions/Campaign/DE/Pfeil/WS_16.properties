Name Rademacher
Short Destroy the Allied Reconnaissance Aircraft........\n
Description Date: January 15th, 1946.\n\nTime: 12:00 Hours.\n\nWeather: Snow with clouds at 1500 meters.\n\nLocation: Hespe.\n\nWe have just received a report from the Freya radar station of a high-flying enemy reconnaissance aircraft entering Sector "Emil-Eva".\n\nIt is flying at an altitude of about 8500 meters. Although the weather is bad at the moment, it could clear up at any time. We need to prevent this aircraft from spotting our airfield here, so once again it is essential to eliminate this aircraft.\n\nAfter takeoff, head due north from the airfield while climbing to maximum altitude. You should be able to spot the target just north of Moscheiken.\n\nAs you know, we are having many technical problems with our aircraft from lack of spare parts, and we lost many of our front line fighters in the recent day's operations, so be careful not to get into any mechanical difficulties. \n\nYou know where the emergency airfield is: Grid reference "R-6" in case you run in to trouble.\n\nGood luck and good hunting.......\n
