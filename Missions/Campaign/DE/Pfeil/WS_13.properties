Short Find & destroy the American "Super Forts....."\n
Description Date: December 6th, 1945.\n\nTime: 13:51 Hours.\n\nWeather: Hazy conditions with scattered clouds at 1200 meters.\n\nLocation: Hespe.\n\nWe have just received reports from Division Area Headquarters that the Freya radar stations on the coast have picked up American "Super Fortresses" as they call their B-29s, heading into Sector "Friedrich-Paula".\n\nYou and your Geschwader get airborne as quickly as you can to catch these "Fat Babies" before they can do any harm. They're height is 6000 meters, so make sure you're above that for the intercept. When dealing with these bombers, make sure your speed is as high as possible so it will be harder for those gunners to get a shot off at you. Speed is of the utmost inportance!!\n\nYour heading will be 336 degrees for the intercept.\n\nKeep a close eye on your fuel. You will be operating at your maximum range. If you are running low on fuel, land on the nearest airfield and we will send fuel and anything else you need by transport so you can return here as quickly as possible.\n\nGood luck and good hunting....\n\n
