Name Diken Autos
Short Destroy the American "Fat Cars"\n
Description Date:November 17th, 1945.\n\nTime: 14:36 Hours.\n\nWeather: Good visibility with scattered clouds at 1300 meters.\n\nLocation: Hespe\n\nWe have just received reports from Division Area Headquarters that the Freya radar stations have picked up American Super Fortresses heading towards Sector "Friedrich-Paula".\n\nGet your Geschwader upstairs as quick as you can to catch the "Diken Autos". They are currently flying at about 6000 meters, so make sure you're at least at this height for the intercept. I should think 1000 meters higher would be even better. The faster you can dive on them, the harder it will be for the gunners to get a shot off at you.\n\nAfter takeoff set a heading of 336 degrees for the intercept.  \n\nKeep a close eye on your fuel. You will be operating at your maximum range and I don't want you having to bail out and destroy one of our aircraft because you didn't keep an eye on the gauges. If you are running low on fuel, land on the nearest airfield and we will send fuel by transport so you can return with your Pfeil intact.\n\nGood luck and good hunting....\n\n \n  \n
