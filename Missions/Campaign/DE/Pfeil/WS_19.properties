Name More Fat Cars
Short The American "Fat Babies" are back in force....\n
Description Date: February 14th, 1946.\n\nTime: 14:00 Hours.\n\nWeather: Clear with scattered clouds at 1500 meters.\n\nLocation: Hespe.\n\nWe have just received reports from Division Area Headquarters that a group of American heavy bombers are heading towards Sector "Friedrich-Paula".\n\nOur jet bomber Gruppe, KG51 is stationed up that way, also operating from a hidden landing strip. It is very likely that the bombers are heading for them as we have heard they were raided by American Jabos two days ago. We only have two Schwarms we can spare at the moment, as the others have not returned from their mission yet.\n\n I have spoken with the commander of JG26, and they have a few of Gotha's new Go-229 wonder jets on hand to send over and lend you a hand. \n\nYou can expect to rendezvous with them just north of Plunge if you hurry and get airborne......\n\nGood luck.......\n\n
