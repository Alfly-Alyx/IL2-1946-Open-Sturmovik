Name JG 400 Berlin 6
Short The Heavies are back.........\n
Description Date: April 16th 1946.\n\nTime: 13:33 Hours.\n\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Clouds at 1300 meters.\n\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nOnce again today, the radar station reports heavy bombers heading in from the West. This time it looks like the four engine "Super Fortresses" as they call them. Remember that their weakest angle is a head-on attack from above. If you try to sit behind them and fire away with your cannons, don't blame me when they shoot you full of holes. \n\nWe will scramble a couple of jets and try to head them off before they can do any damage. The Wurger Staffel is climbing to altitude right now to cover your take off and landing.\n\nGood luck........you're gonna need it....\n
