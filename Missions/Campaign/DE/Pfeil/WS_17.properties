Short Destroy the Russian Sturmoviks.......\n
Description Date: Janauary 23rd, 1946.\n\nTime: 10:22 Hours.\n\nWeather: Fair visibility with clouds at 1400 meters.\n\nLocation: Hespe.\n\nWe have just received a report from Division Area Headquarters that a large, slow moving formation of aircraft are entering Sector "Karl-Baudach" at low altitude. It is safe to bet that this as another low level ground attack raid by the "Crazy Ivans".\n\nGet airborne as quickly as you can and keep them from reaching their target if at all possible. Our supplies are already at the critical stage and every attack we can prevent is that much less they can destroy. Their current altitude is about 1000 meters, so be very careful not to run into the ground.\n\nGood hunting and good luck.\n\n
