Name Melee.
Short British Bombers are heading for our Sea Port.....\n
Description Date: November 5th, 1945.\n\nTime: 12:09 Hours.\n\nWeather: Scattered Cloud at 1300 meters.\n\nLocation: Lager-Lechfeld.\n\nReports are coming through from the Freya Radar Station at Division Area Headquarters that the British Mosquitoes are back entering Sector "Gustav-Anton" this time at sea level. They seem determine Unterseeboot Pens  and Ship Yard\n\nMake them think again!!!\n\nThe bombers appear to be unescorted so this should be the opportunity we have been hoping for to hit them hard. If you time your attack correctly, you should find some easy pickings for yourselves out there.\n\nGood luck and good hunting....\n\n\n  \n
