Name JG 400 Berlin 2
Short On Our Own......\n
Description Date: April 4th 1946.\n\nTime: 14:59 Hours.\n\nWeather: Rain & Thunder with Clouds at 700 meters.\n\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nTake off with a Kette of Pfeil Fighters and patrol the area to the west in search of enemy aircraft.\n\nBritish Gabelschwanz Teufels have been strafing and harassing our fuel supply trains and if they are allowed to continue, we will have no fuel to fly.\n\nWe have arranged for a flight of He-162's to cover your takeoff and landing from higher altitude so you will not be quite so vulnerable to enemy attack during these periods of your flight. The enemy is well aware that we are getting short of fuel so they must not be let to complete their mission....  \n\nGood luck and good hunting......\n  \n
