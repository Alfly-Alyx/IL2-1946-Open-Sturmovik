Short Get The Diken Autos......\n
Description Date: April 10th 1946.\n\nTime: 15:00 Hours.\n\nWeather: Low Clouds at 500 meters.\n\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nGet upstairs.............quick!!!!! Freya Radar have reported that 'Diken Autos' are heading our way....\n\nYou'll won't be able to catch them when they get near, but our Ta's are already airborne so you'll can pick off any straggle's which our left....I do have some good news for you today though. We now have 2 250kg ab bomb's fitted to your internal bomb bay  of your Pfeil's. You need to get at least 500 meters above and slightly forward of the bomber's to achieve any results. All aircarft have been fitted with these new bombs so make good use of them when you encounter the "Diken Autos"  If you can break up any formation left it will be easier for you to pick off the stragglers one by one with your cannons.\n\nWe are eagerly awaiting the results of today's operational test of our new weapon system......  \n\nGood luck men....\n\n\n\n
