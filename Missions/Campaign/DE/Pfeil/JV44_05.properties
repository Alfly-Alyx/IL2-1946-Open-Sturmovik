Name JG 400 Berlin 5
Short A Thumb in the Dike....\n
Description Date: April 15th 1946.\n\nTime: 16:37 Hours.\n\nWeather: Good with Clouds at 1500 meters.\n\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nIt was interesting to find out on our last sortie that the AB Bombs were so effective. With a blast like that, it is almost impossible to miss. This gives us great potential for breaking up the American bomber formations. It is unfortunate that we did not have these weapons earlier or the Allies would not have been able to continue their daylight raids that have caused so much destruction to our cities.\n\nToday you will be armed with AB's as well as the radar station has reported a large group of enemy bombers heading our way from the southwest. We believe them to be British Mosquitoes so I want to see how well our AB's work on a much smaller target.\n\nWe will send up a Kette of three Pfeil's to meet them. \n\nThe Mosquitoes are reported cruising at 3000 meters so you'll need to get above them before initiating your attack. Remember these planes are a bit faster and much smaller so us your bomb's well.....once you've use them, attack with cannon \n\nGood luck and good hunting! \n
