Short Get your Arrow aloft now!!!!\n
Description Date: 30th/31st March 1946.\n\nTime: 23:33\n\nWeathe: Good with cloud base at 1400 meters. \n\nLocation: Hespe.\n\nGuten Tag, Herr Experten!\n\nReport's are coming through from Division Area Headquarters that a number of British Mosquitoes are now entering Sector: Friedrich-Paula. All our other Nightfighter's are engaged in other Sector's so you'll have to go and do the job yourself.\n\nThey are flying at the rough height of 5600m. You'll have to get above that height (6000m) and you'll need to fly on the Heading of: 335 for an intercept.\n\nRemember, on Take Off,  open her up slowly to 100% throttle before you release them. But don't do it too slowly as the forest is at the end of the Runway. I know that you know this already, but you're flying at night from an Autobahn.......\n\nOnce over city keep your eye's peeled for the searchlights as they will help you guide into the targets.\n\nAlso on the way home you will see 2 Searchlights lit up to help you see Home Base.\n\nGood luck and good hunting....\n\n\n  \n
