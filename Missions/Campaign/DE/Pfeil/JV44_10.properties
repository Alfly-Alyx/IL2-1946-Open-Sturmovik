Name JG 400 Berlin 10
Short The 'Diken Autos' are back.......\n
Description Date: April 24th 1946.\n\nTime: 13:17 Hours.\n\nWeather: Rain with clouds at 800 meters.\n\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nThe weather has taken a turn for the worse and a frontal system has blown in from the west. Since there is a stiff breeze, you will be taking off from the east end of the runway today.\n\nRadar reports a large formation of Diken Autos with Indianers passing to the northwest of our field. Some of you new boys from Stab/JG 7 and a few of our old hands will intercept them and see what we can do to prevent their arrival at their planned destination.\n\nWe all know that whatever we do is not going to win the war for us now, but it is our duty to keep on fighting to the last. I am honored to lead this distinguished group of pilots and appreciate the courageous efforts of every one of you. Good luck !\n\n
