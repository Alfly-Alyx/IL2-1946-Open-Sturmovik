Name Sturmjager
Short Go and do a Standing Patrol......\n
Description Date: February 19th, 1946.\n\nTime: 14:48 Hours.\n\nWeather: Blind with low clouds at 500 meters.\n\nLocation: Hespe.\n\nI want you to take your Staffel and do a Standing Patrol over and around the City of Schaulen. Other Staffel's have been reporting Standing patrol of American & British Fighter's and Fighter Bomber's in the area to try and force us up to combat them.\n\nOur number of servicable aircraft is depleted so you'll only have 8 to play with today I'm afraid and a few that will be flying today I have my doubts about......the mechanics are doing they best to salvaged what they could from the damaged ones so we can get up to full strength again......\n\nMake your departure quick, as the weather is starting to close in as snow is forecast for the next week or so...\n\n.........we'll see you back here shortly.\n\nGood luck.\n
