Name Crazy Ivans
Short Destroy the incoming Russian Aircraft.......\n
Description Date: December 20th, 1945.\n\nTime: 13:51 Hours.\n\nWeather: Blind with low clouds at 700 meters.\n\nLocation: Hespe.\n\nWe have just received reports from Division Area Headquarters that the Freya radar stations have picked up a large force of "Crazy Ivans" heading our way. They're passing through Sector "Karl-Sorrern" as I speak to you.\n\nGet your 2 Schwarms airborne as quick as you can to deal with this threat. You'll be outnumbered, but the Doras will back you up if need be. The enemy formation's height is between 3500 and 4500 meters, so you should gain plenty of altitude  before you reach them. \n\nIt's imperative that you get to the bombers before they can reach our airfield, so deal with the fighters after you break up the bombers!\n\nGood luck and good hunting....\n\n
