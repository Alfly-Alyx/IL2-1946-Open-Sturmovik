Short Berlin Patrol......\n
Description Date: March 25th, 1946.\n\nTime: 10:00 Hours.\n\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Clouds at 1000 meters.\n\nLocation: Berlin\n\nGuten Morgen Gentlemen.....and welcome to the final battle!!!. You are now members of "The Galland Circus" as they are calling us and for those of you who may not know me yet, I am Generalleutnant Adolf Galland.  \n\nYour Staffel: 7./JG 400 is now included in our merry little 'Circus' of our's of all the remaining piston & jet ace staffel's. I will not bore you with the details of how we all arrived at this end, but it is now your duty to fly and fight until the very last.....\n\nThis morning, you will patrol to the East of Berlin as a training exercise and hunt for Russians making strafing attacks against our positions.\n\nA Kette of 3 Pfeil Fighters will be led by your Head of Training, Oberst Johannes Steinhoff. Some of you already know Oberst Steinhoff from his days in JG7 together before you all came here with the rest of the outcasts to prepare you for the final battles. "Macki" and I are both of the opinion that the high speed of the Pfeil's will make it more practical to fly in groups of 3 instead of the normal Schwarm of 4 aircraft. \n\nGet use to these new tatics gentleman as that's what we're gonna use from now on........\n \nGood luck.\n \n
