Name JG 400 Berlin 11
Short Galland's Last Stand.....\n
Description Date: April 26th 1946.\n\nTime: 15:16 Hours.\n\nWeather: Scattered clouds at 1200 meters.\n\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nI have some bad news for all of you today. I must inform you that the American and Russian armies joined together at the Elbe River yesterday and have effectively split Germany in half. We are now cut off from Berlin, but we will continue to operate as before.\n\nToday I will lead a mission to intercept the British bombers that continue to attack targets to our northeast near Munich. I expect all of you to press your attacks as close as possible and do not return to base with ammunition left in your cannons! That is all... Dismissed!\n\n
