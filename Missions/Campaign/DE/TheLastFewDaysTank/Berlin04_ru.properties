Description \nCode: "Wessel"\n---------------------\n\nTarget: Enemy artillery positions facing Seelow (Map Ref:K6)\n\nYou will strike enemy artillery positions in the indicated sector using bombs.  Take care to maintain height and speed over the target, as the enemy Katyushas are ranged upward against Seelow.\n\nOur defences are holding well against Ivan.  Soon newer and greater weapons will be available to throw this cur back to his eastern lair.\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\nArming: 2 x SC250\n\n1130 15 April 1945\n
