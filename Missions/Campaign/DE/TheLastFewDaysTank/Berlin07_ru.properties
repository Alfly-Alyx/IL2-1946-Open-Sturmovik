Description \nCode: "Typhoon"\n---------------------\n\nGeneral Busse's men at Seelow are holding well against the overwhelming firepower of the Russians.  So far Ivan's attempts to gain the heights have been disastrous.  It is clear the only superiority the enemy has is in numbers and bone-headed tenacity.\n\nArmy Group Vistula have requested relief from the constant enemy air strikes.  We shall assist them by patrolling the Seelow positions and warding off these attacks.  Even now, the glimmer of a victory presents itself.\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\n0610 17 April 1945\n
