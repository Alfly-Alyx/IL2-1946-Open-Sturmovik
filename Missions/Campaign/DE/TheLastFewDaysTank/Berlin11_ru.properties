Description \nCode: "Panther"\n---------------------\n\nYou will mount a dawn patrol around the vicinity of Berlin.  You will look out for enemy reconnaissance planes.  Now that Seelow has finally yielded, we must prevent the Soviets taking advantage of any confustion that arises as we reorganise our front.\n\nThe F\u00FChrer reminds us that all is not lost.  We are merely luring the Russians into a greater quagmire within Berlin itself.  The final act has begun - it is a moment that Ivan will come to regret.\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\n0435 20 April 1945\n
