Description \nCode: "Weasel"\n---------------------\n\nTarget: Kustrin bridgehead (Map Ref:M6)\n\nYou will escort a pair of Friedrichs to the Kustrin sector, where they will attempt to destroy bridging equipment.  This is a precision strike, and the Schlachtgeschwaders are the experts.\n\nWe have received disturbing reports of our women at Kustrin drowning themselves en masse to avoid the predations of the Red Army.  We know from events elsewhere that our womenfolk are right to live in fear of the Asiatic vermin.\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\n0800 16 April 1945\n
