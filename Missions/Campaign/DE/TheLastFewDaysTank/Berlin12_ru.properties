Description \nCode: "Wolf"\n---------------------\n\nYou will mount a CAP at 3000 metres to establish an air perimeter around Berlin.  It should not concern you for long that you make these patrols in small numbers.  We have miracle jets that are currently being produced in their thousands.  Together with our glorious Youth, they will quickly re-establish our superiority.\n\nWe are cutting the patrol strength to a single pair to make better use of the further reduction of our fuel entitlement.  You will make use of this occasion to trial the new X-4 guided rockets.  Ensure you are familiar with their instructions for usage prior to take-off.\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\nArming: 2 x X-4\n\n0840 21 April 1945\n
