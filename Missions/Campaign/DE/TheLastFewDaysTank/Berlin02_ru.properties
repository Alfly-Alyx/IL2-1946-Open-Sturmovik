Description \nCode: "Wolf"\n---------------------\n\nConduct dawn CAP around prescribed route.  Maintain height at 3000 metres.  Do not interfere with Soviet fighter patrols.  Note quantity and direction of enemy air activity.\n\nShipment of regular fuel supplies will be halved from this day onwards.  This is a necessary re-allocation to further strengthen our inner defensive air cordon.  Be grateful that the Reich chooses to supply you at all.\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\n0620 15 April 1945\n
