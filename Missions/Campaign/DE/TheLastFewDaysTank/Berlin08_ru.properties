Description \nCode: "Jackal"\n---------------------\n\nYou will return to Seelow this afternoon, and once more attempt to relieve them of the pestilence of the Sturmoviks.  They are striking at this very moment.\n\nIt cheers our lads greatly when they see those clumsy machines plummet to the Earth.  Do even more to raise their morale.\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\n1520 18 April 1945\n
