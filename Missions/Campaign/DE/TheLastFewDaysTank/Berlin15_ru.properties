Description \nCode: "Storm"\n---------------------\n\nThe Führer and his staff are preparing to evacuate Berlin.  We do not of course know his destination, but we must assume that it will be a location where he can further direct efforts against the Bolsheviks and their Jewish-Capitalist allies.\n\nNo matter.  You will patrol the central district of the city, ensuring that enemy attack aircraft cannot disrupt the evacuation effort.  Only if the Führer survives can victory be grasped from the ashes.\n\nWe have no remaining fuel to conduct further sorties.  When you return you will be handed a sub-machine gun and directed to ground defensive operations.\n\nThis war is far from over.  The long fight back has only begun!\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\n1430 25 April 1945\n
