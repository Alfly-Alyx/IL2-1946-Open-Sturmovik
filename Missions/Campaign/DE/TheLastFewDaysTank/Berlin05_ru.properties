Description \nCode: "Owl"\n---------------------\n\nWe must abandon our base here at Frankfurt and move to Ludwigsfelde.  We are maintaining the pretence that this field has been abandoned.  The facilities and aircraft will be located in the small wood to the east of the base.  This is where you will taxi to when you land.\n\n~Heil Hitler~\n\n0525 16 April 1945\n
