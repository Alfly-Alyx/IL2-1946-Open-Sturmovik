Description Date: 15.07.1943\n\nTime: 10:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: good\n\nWe were visited by the Stab. The situation on the home front is critical they say and the allied forces have landed in Italy! Back home our cities are bombed and blown to pieces by allied raids. Women, children and old people are dying.\n\nThe IInd SS-Panzerkorps is encountering Strong soviet defences. The ground is softened by the constant rain and this makes it even more difficult to make any movement at all. The number of units ready for action is terribly low. The 6th Panzerdivision reports that only six tanks are ready! Many tanks are being repaired and cannot be brought to the frontline, and the supplies do not come through.\nNevertheless, your mission is to fly CAP west of Prokhorovka. Dismissed.\n\n
