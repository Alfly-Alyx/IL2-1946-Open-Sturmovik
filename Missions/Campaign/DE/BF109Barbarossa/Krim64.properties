Description Date: 10.05.1942\n\n\nTime: 02:00 p.m.\n\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nGute Arbeit. You spotted part of the Russian Schwarzmeerflotte! Oberkommando wants it to be destroyed at once!\n\nYou will escort eight He-111 torpedo-bombers on the way to their target. You will also carry bombs. Try to sink anything that is Russian! We must keep the area free from enemy forces, otherwise Generaloberst von Manstein will not be able to capture the Kerch Peninsula.\n\nYou can bet that Ivan is warned, so expect Soviet fighters to intercept the bombers. The fleet itself is supposed to go south. Protect the bombers and do as much damage as you can!\n\nGood hunting!\n\n
