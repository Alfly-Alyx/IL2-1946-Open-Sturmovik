Description Date: 12.05.1942\n\n\nTime: 10:00 a.m.\n\n\nWeather: misty\n\n\nIt rained cats and dogs yesterday, so you could not even think of flying. Today, it looks better, so get out and up!\n\nFly towards Feodosia and Kerch. The Russian troops have finally got problems with supplies and therefore we expect many transport flights in this area. Your mission is to intercept these flights. Dismissed.\n\n\n
