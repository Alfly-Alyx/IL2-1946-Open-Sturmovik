Description Date: 07.06.1942\n\n\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\n\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nHolidays are over and we need you over here! The 11th Armee will start "Unternehmen St\u00F6rfang", the battle for Sevastopol, the strongest fortress in the world! Seven and a half German and one and a half Rumanian divisions will take part in it. There will be a lot of hardware, trust me! The heavy mortars "Thor" and "Odin" with their 61.5cm shells and even the giant 80cm cannon "Dora" will crack the fortress into pieces!\nThe VIIIth Fliegerkorps will support this operation and you will escort Ju88 bombers on their way to Sevastopol. They will bomb the harbour and the ships. Flak activity is supposed to be heavy, so be careful!. You might encounter Soviet fighter planes, but I reckon you can handle them.\nWegtreten!\n\n
