Description Date: 12.07.1941	\n\nTime: 07:30 p.m.\n\nWeather: overcast\n\nLocation: Flightschool Sulecin\n\n\nWell done my young pilot. You finished flight-school - not bad at all!\nYou will be transferred to the Lehrgeschwader 1, which is located at Gatow, Berlin/Potsdam. It is led by Oberst Friedrich Karl Knust. When you arrive there, you will receive further instructions.\n\nJust one more thing - weather is not that good today, so you'd better fly with caution. There is plenty of traffic out there from other flight-trainees like you were, so you'd better watch out.\n\nGood Luck and Hals- und Beinbruch!\n\n
