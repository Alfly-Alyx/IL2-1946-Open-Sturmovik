Description Date: 04.09.1942\n\n\nTime: 08:30 p.m.\n\n\nWeather: clear\n\n\nWe have been asked to do a special job tonight. Our friends of the I/St.G 1 are attacked every night by the 'night witches'. Although they cannot do much damage, our fellow pilots cannot sleep!\nJust be careful out there. It is very dark and these bi-planes are very slow and not an easy target! Good hunting!\n\n
