Description \nDate: 13.11.1942\n\n\nTime: 09:00 a.m.\n\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nWelcome to Stalingrad!\n\nOur situation is that in the city there is fierce hadn-to-hand combat. It's a grim task for us and the Russians as well. The Russians will not surrender, although we already have about 90 percent of the city. No Russian ships will reach the city any more, but somewhere and somehow enemy troops did come to Stalingrad. They could cross the river. The Pionier-Bataillon 162 has just split the Russian base at the shores of the Volga.\nFly CAP over the city, wegtreten!\n\n
