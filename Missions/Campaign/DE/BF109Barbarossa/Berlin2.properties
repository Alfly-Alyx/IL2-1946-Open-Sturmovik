Description Date: 13.07.1941    \n\nTime: 09:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: good\n\nLocation: Berlin/Potsdam, Airport Gatow\n\n\n\nWelcome to the Lehrgeschwader 1, led by Oberst Friedrich Karl Knust.\n\nWar on the eastern front has already begun and our pilots there are fully occupied, so you will receive your final training here before you go east. I know you just can\u00B4t wait to get there, but you will have to learn something more; something we have learned about the Soviets in the first weeks of Unternehmen Barbarossa. In the end you will be greatful, mark my words!\nBut for now, relax. Today\u00B4s mission is nothing more than a simple sightseeing-tour over Berlin. Your task is easy - stay close to your Rottenf\u00FChrer. It is essential that the Gruppe stays together under all circumstances.\n\nAfter the flight you will report to the Oberst. He usually talks to every new man, so you'd better perform well!\n\nNow get going, los los!\n\n
