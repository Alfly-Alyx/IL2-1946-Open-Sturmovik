Description Date: 09.10.1941\n\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nBadly needed supplies are on their way!\nMeet the Ju-52 transporters and escort them to the main airbase at Volokolmsk. Wait there up in the air and circle around until all transporters have landed safely. Then return home.\n\n***Mission-note: I assume that you are Rottenf\u00FChrer already. If not, the AI-Rottenf\u00FChrer will not circle above the airfield and wait for the Ju-52s to land, but will return home. :-)***\n\n\n
