Description Date: 01.10.1941\n\nTime: 10:30 a.m.\n\nWeather: clear\n\n\nNice to see you again! That was a Soviet ace, Pokryshkin, a Hero of the Soviet Union! It seems he met his match, at least on this occasion.\nSo, the situation here is like this:\n\nOur troops are advancing towards Moscow in the heart of Russia. Our target is the city of Rzhev in the north. We have to take it over. The Panzerdivisionen of Panzergruppe 3 and 4 are already on the way.\n\nFly Freie Jagd (CAP) in the area around Rzhev. The II/JG 54 is north of the city, too. Be careful - flak in this area is supposed to be very strong!\nDismissed.\n
