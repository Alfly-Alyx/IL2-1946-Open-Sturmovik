Description 13th April 1945\n\nThe fuel shortages which curtailed piston-engined fighter operations so drastically is beginning to impact upon our own. Compounded by the targeting of our airfields by daylight bomber formations and strafing Allied fighters, it is only a matter of time before we are out of the fight!\n\nThis morning, due to a shortage of J-2 fuel, we will fly patrol only in Schwarm strength. Beware of marauding Allied fighters during take off!\n
