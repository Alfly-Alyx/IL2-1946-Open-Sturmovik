Name JF52
Description 22 February 1944\n\nThe Americans have launched a massive bombing raid against aircraft production plants all over eastern and central Germany. We failed to find them on their way in, but we will ambush them on their way home!\n\nWe are starting to see enemy fighters roaming further and further inside our borders recently, as well as the shape of a new twin-engined fighter the Americans are using, we call the Fork-tailed Devil, because of its twin booms. They now appear to use a type of relay system for escorting their bombers, with specific groups being assigned to patrol certain sectors of the bombers' flight paths, rather than escort particular formations of bombers.\n
