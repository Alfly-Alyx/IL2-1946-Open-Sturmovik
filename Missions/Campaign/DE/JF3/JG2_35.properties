Name JF55
Description 6 March 1944\n\nUnfortunately we are no longer capable of making maximum strength defensive efforts against each and every bombing raid, but today we will concentrate our firepower against the bombers using a new tactic.\n\nTogether with I/JG1 and the experimental Sturmstaffel Eins, flying heavily armed and armoured "battering ram" variants of the A8, we will form a Gefechtsverband, in order to temporarily overwhelm the American bombers. III/JG1 in their 109's will fly top cover to protect us from the now omnipresent American fighters.\n\nAnother big raid is heading for Berlin... scramble your fighters and fly bearing 296.\n
