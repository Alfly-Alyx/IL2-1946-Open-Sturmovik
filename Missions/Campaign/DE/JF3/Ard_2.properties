Description 18th December 1944\n\nBad weather remains limiting our operations, but also those of the Allied air forces, possibly explaining the better than expected progress of our ground forces.\n\nThe USAAF's 9th Airforce have been making sporadic attacks, however, when the opportunity arises. As such, we must still fly some patrols over the battlefield.\n
