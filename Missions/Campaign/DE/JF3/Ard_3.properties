Description 23rd December 1944\n\nThe Wehrmacht has taken advantage of the poor weather to make significant advances behind Allied lines, however, this morning we woke up to find a beatiful clear morning. This is the opportunity the Allied air forces have been waiting for!\n\nHaving avoided the marauding American fighters over our airfield this morning, we will fly south west where we have been tasked with protecting the panzers of Heeresgruppe B advancing on the Meuse River.\n
