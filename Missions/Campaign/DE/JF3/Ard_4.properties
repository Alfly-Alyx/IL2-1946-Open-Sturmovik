Description 24th December 1944\n\nYesterday's airfighting cost the Jagdwaffe dearly in casualties, however, today we can expect similar treatment at the hands of the Allied air forces.\n\nThe American 8th Air Force heavies have just bombed our airfields in the Ruhr... we must scramble and intercept them as they return home. III/JG27, in their new 109K's, will fly top cover for us.\n
