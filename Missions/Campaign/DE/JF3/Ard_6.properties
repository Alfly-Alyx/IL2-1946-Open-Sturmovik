Description 26th December 1944\n\nAfter another disastrous day for both the Wehrmacht and the Luftwaffe, it seems now the war is lost, especially as our ground forces are having to abandon their armour through lack of fuel supllies. It is only a matter of time until we feel this added strain also!\n\nThis morning's sortie was supposed to be a fighter sweep in force with elements of JG27 and JG6, however, our rendezvous never materialised. Continue on and fly a sweep east of the frontlines to protect the Wehrmacht from further air attack.\n
