Description 7th June 1944\n\nYesterday the Allied invasion force landed along the beaches of Normandy. Expecting heavier landings in the Pas-de-Calais sector, the order from Oberkommando West to transfer the fighters of Luftflotte Reich to France, never came. Last night, the Luftwaffe itself issued the order on its own authority, and this morning we transferred into Normandy.\n\nThis afternoon we will fly a Gruppe strength sweep to cover the roads to the South East of the landing grounds, along which reinforcements for our ground troops are passing. Protect our forces from fighter bomber attack and expect heavy fighter opposition!\n
