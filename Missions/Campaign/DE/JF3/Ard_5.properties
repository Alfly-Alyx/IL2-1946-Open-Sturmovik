Description 25th December 1944\n\nChristmas Day... but we have nothing to smile about. The Jagdwaffe again took heavy casualties in yesterday's airfighting. The success of Wacht Am Rhein is in the balance as the battle below reaches its climax, with the rear areas of Heeresgruppe B coming under sustained medium bomber and fighter-bomber attack. \n\nWith yet another clear day, the Allied fighter bombers will again be out in force. Fly a patrol east of Bastogne. Fighters from I/JG27 will be on station soon to assist.\n
