Name JF51
Description 12 February 1944\n\nWelcome back to the action! Due to the continued haemoraging of the Jagdflieger's most experienced leaders, your constant requests to be returned to active duty have finally been heard. Not only that, since you are now recognised as one of the Experten, you have been given command of your own Gruppe.\n\nBased at Stormede, under the command of the newly formed Luftflotte Reich, you will be leading II/JG1 into battle as the first line of defence against the increasing number of American bombing raids targetting central and northern Germany, and more recently, Berlin. \n\n"Heavy babies approaching sector Dora Dora!" Climb into your new A8 and lead your Gruppe into action to attack the Americans.\n
