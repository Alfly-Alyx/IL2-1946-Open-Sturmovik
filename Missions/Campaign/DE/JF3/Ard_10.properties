Description 10th January 1945\n\nBodenplatte was not only a complete failure, despite some individual unit results, but saw the end of the Jagdwaffe as an effective fighting force! Despite these saddening events, we have been ordered to take up what aircraft remain in a vain attempt to offer token resistance. Take off and lead two Staffeln on a fighter sweep over the Belgian border.\n
