Name JF54
Description 24 February 1944\n\nWe have learned that the Americans have launched an all out offensive against targets in Germany this week... their so called "Big Week"! We have made them pay a heavy price, however, losing 41 of their heavies in total two days ago!\n\nLets see if we can get some more... radar reports the dicke autos und indianer approaching again! Beware of the increasing numbers of escorting fighters, however... they appear to flying their own version of our favourite Freie Jagd in an attempt to break up into us before we can make our formation attacks.\n\nWe have also heard reports of the Americans using another new fighter, with even longer range than the P38 and P47, penetraing deeper into our airspace.\n
