Description 1st January 1945\n\nA New Year dawns, but any distant hopes of turning the war around are long gone with this morning's astonishing news! Late yesterday afternoon,3rd Jagddivision issued orders for Unternehmen 'Bodenplatte'... a supposed 'great blow' in the form of a simultaneous attack on all continental Allied airfields by all Geschwader. In light of the terrific punishment we have suffered during recent days, it seems altogether fantastic that the high command could seriously consider committing the remainder of our forces to this folly!\n\nBut orders are orders! All pilots are to fly at low altitude to Grimbergen airfield where we will attempt to shoot up any Allied aircraft we can find. Good luck!\n
