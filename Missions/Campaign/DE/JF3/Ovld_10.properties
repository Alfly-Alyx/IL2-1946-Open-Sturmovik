Description 20th June 1944\n\nThis morning our unit was again transferred, this time to a a small field landing ground near the village of Semalle. As operations were being established, however, a force of American P51's swept in over the field and within the space of a few minutes shot up nearly everything in sight in a series of co-ordinated strafing runs.\n\nWith our remaining serviceable aircraft, we will fly what may be our final sortie in the defence of Normandy!\n
