Description 17th December 1944\n\nAfter surviving just 12 days in Normandy, II/JG1 was temporarily disbanded pending re-equipment back in Germany. Due to this period of inactivity, you have taken command of I/JG26 and worked the unit back up into an effective fighting force, flying the brand new long nosed Fw190 'Dora'. With this new aircraft, we should be a match for any Allied fighter!\n\nIn a last ditch bid to stem the Allied advance towards the Rhine, Hitler is preparing the Wacht Am Rhein offensive, a surprise attack through the Ardennes aimed at securing Antwerp and interrupting Allied operartions, before the Russians get close to Germany. The Luftwaffe has managed to assemble nearly 1,000 fighters to support the operation, however, these could have been much better used in Adolf Galland's planned 'Big Blow' attack, which could render the American daylight heavy bomber force ineffective.\n\nNevertheless, the Wehrmacht achieved complete surprise in last night's opening of Hitler's latest great plan. This morning, you will take off amid the snow flurries and 'soup' towards St. Vith where ground forces report Allied fighter bombers off in the distance.\n
