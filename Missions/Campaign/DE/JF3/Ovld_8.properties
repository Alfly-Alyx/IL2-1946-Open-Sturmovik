Description 18th June 1944\n\nIt appears the Allies are launching a major offensive against Caen due to the stiff resistance the Wehrmacht are putting up. This morning saw a number of raids by Allied heavy bombers and we can no doubt expect more. Take off and fly another fighting patrol south of Caen.\n
