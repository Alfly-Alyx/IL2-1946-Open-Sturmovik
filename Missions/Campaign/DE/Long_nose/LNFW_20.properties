The RAF's 122 Wing is based their mainly equipped with Tempests and Spitfires. Our jet recon aircraft have photographed other aircraft on the the airfield - 2 engine and 4 engine aircraft. A Ju88 night fighter will help navigate us to our jump-off point.\n\nStudy the table-top model of the target airfield - remember the following points:-\n1. Everything counts!\n2. At the jumping off point switch on your radio.\nSwitch on station keeping lights.\nSwitch on armament.\n3. Maintain discipline.\n4. Pay particular attention for damaged and burning aircraft!
