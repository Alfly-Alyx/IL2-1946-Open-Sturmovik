Short The Fw190D-9 'Dora' and a briefing from Generalleutnant Adolf Galland\n
Description Date: June 1944\nTime: 0800\nWeather: Good\nCloud height: 1000m\n\n\nHans, I have been watching your achievments on the Russian front and they are impressive.\n Because you are a very accomplished Focke- Wulf pilot, I am puting you in charge of JGr200 which will combat test our latest fighter on the Western front - the Fw190D 'Dora'\n This aircraft is fitted with a 1,776hp Junkers Jumo 213 liquid-cooled in-line engine (thus the name 'Langnasen Dora')\n Powered with this engine we know it will easily 'take on and beat' the best of the Western fighters - the Spitfire XIV and the P51D Mustang.\n After your test flight today, I want you to start 'working up' your Gruppen for a move to Normandy.\nTake one of my cigars. I want you to report to me regularly on your progress.\nGood luck, you will like this aircraft, I certainly enjoyed flying it.\nGen.Galland\n\nSelect skin: Fw-190D-9_JG301_white12.bmp\n
