Name Long nose Focke-Wulf pilot 51
Short Air protection over Grossenbrode\n
Description Date: May 1945\nTime: 1205\nWeather: Thunder\nCloud height: 1400m\n\n\nEarly this morning the Staffel took-off and flew north along the coastline in atrocious weather - severe thunder storms and heavy rain kept us company the whole trip - sadly we lost two aircraft with their pilots reported missing.\n\nOur destination was Grossenbrode air-naval base. Here we were to provide air protection while our transports and transport flying boats evacuated to the Danish islands and further north to Norway - the Luftwaffe was on the move - could this be the end?\n\nHans, we have just chased away a high flying reconnaissance Spitfire. I want you to take-off and position your Staffel up-Sun for a surprise attack. We are expecting large formations of Allied jabo's within the hour.\n\nGood luck - dismissed.\n\nSelect skin: Ta-152c-Tromp-11-Jaune-III-KG27.bmp\n
