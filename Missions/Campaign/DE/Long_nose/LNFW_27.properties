Name Long nose Focke-Wulf pilot 27
Short Ordered back to Berlin by Gen.Galland\n\n\n\n\n
Description Date: March 1945\nTime: 0849\nWeather: Clear\nCloud height: 1500m\n\n\nHans reported to Gen. Galland on arrival in Berlin.\n\nHans, you have done very well with your Dora's on the Western front, accounting for many Allied aircraft  - I am recommending you for promotion and a well deserved award.\nAs you know, at this time I am not Hitler's most favourite person. I will be forming a jet fighter Gruppe - 'Jv44' based at Munchen-Reim. I will be gathering all the experts I can, to fly these turbo's, including myself.\nI need you to form an expert Staffeln of Dora pilots to protect my turbos during their take-off and landings, when they most vulnerable.\n\nI knew you would be happy to help me in this new task for the Luftwaffe - sadly it may be one of our last.\n\nBy the way, Kurt Tank asked me the other day whether you could 'combat test' his new Dora - the Ta152c. This version of his long nose Focke-Wulf is powered by the latest DB603 powerplant, in place of the Jumo 213. The aircraft packs a powerful punch with a 30mm MK-108 cannon firing through the propellor hub plus two 20mm MG-151/20 wing cannons and two 20mm MG-151/20 upper fuselage cannons.\nThe aircraft is particularly good at medium to high altitudes with two engine boost systems. Anyway report to Dr.Tank and he will give you more technical details - he is looking forward to seeing you.\nI will see you down at Munchen-Reim shortly - good luck with this new fighter.\n\nSelect skin: Scheme 1.bmp (Ta152c)\n\n\n\n\n\n
