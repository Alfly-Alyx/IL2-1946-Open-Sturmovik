You test flew this aircraft on your previous visit to Berlin and told me that you thought it was a great improvement on our Dora's - Dr.Tank was very pleased with your technical report.\nReport to my new jet fighter base at Oranienburg, north of Berlin and pick-up your new aircraft - I am sure you are keen to get them into action.\n\nGen.
