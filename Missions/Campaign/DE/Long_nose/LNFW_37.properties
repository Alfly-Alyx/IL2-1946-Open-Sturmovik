Name Long nose Focke-Wulf pilot 37
Short Escorting the Gotha\n
Description Date: April 1945\nTime: 0800\nWeather: Thunder\nCloud height: 1500m\n\n\nHans, I am sending two turbos out this morning to escort a very secret new jet aircraft we have developed. This aircraft must not be destroyed or fall into enemy hands - I want you to meet the turbos with their charge and give them further protection if required.\n\nWe have had reports this morning that long range British Tempests have been seen operating west of Munich. These Tempests are capable of catching our turbos, so be wary.\n\nGood luck. Dismissed\n\nGen.Galland\n\nSelect skin: Dora-JV44-Rote13NT.bmp\n
