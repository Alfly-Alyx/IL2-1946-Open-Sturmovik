Soon our jabo's must destroy the bridges over the Oder to slow down the Russian advance.\n\nToday we are tasked to protect the important strategic area of Eberswalde-Finow from Russian bomber attack - it is important that our railway infrastructure remains intact in this area.\n\nDismissed -Good luck.\n\nSelect skin: RRG_$JG301.bmp\n\n
