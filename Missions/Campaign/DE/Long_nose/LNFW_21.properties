Short 'Dora'  vs Tempest\n
Description Date: February 1945\nTime: 16:30\nWeather: Blind\nCloud Height:  1000m\n\n\nGentlemen, Generaleutnant Galland was very pleased with our achievments in the 'Big Blow' many allied aircraft were destroyed, though sadly we have lost some of our best comrades.\n\nWe have had reports that the RAF have deployed their best fighter 'the Tempest'  against our fighters in this sector. \nWe have noticed that the Tempests are continually attacking our supply columns and trains.\nToday we are going to carry out an attack 'out of the sun' and surprise these Tempests.\nOur 'Doras' should be a good match to these new Tommy aircraft, though watch out for their diving speed, which is much greater than ours.\nGood luck!\n\nSelect skin: FW190D9_JG6_Barkhorn_hk.bmp (markings off)\n\n
