Name Long nose Focke-Wulf pilot 49
Short Evacuation to Bremen\n
Description Date: May 1945\nTime: 1730\nWeather: Rain/Snow\nCloud height: 1700m\n\n\nHans, the situation around Berlin is getting worse every hour, we have just been ordered to evacuate our Staffel to Bremen in Northern Germany.\n My advice is to follow the Berlin to Hamburg autobahn as the weather conditions are starting to deteriorate. Use your FuG16Zy radio to 'home in' on the Bremen airfield. \nTry and get above the snow clouds, though watch out for British nightfighters, they have been very active around Bremen this week - don't turn on your 'nav lights' unless you have to. \n\nGood luck - see you at Bremen.\n\nSelect skin: Ta-152c-Tromp-11-Jaune-III-KG27.bmp\n
