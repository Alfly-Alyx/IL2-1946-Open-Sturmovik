Short Flames in the Dusk\n
Description Date: May 1945\nTime: 1730\nWeather: Rain/Snow\nCloud height: 700m\n\n\nThis evening we have been ordered to fly with our Focke-Wulf jabo's giving them protection from Allied air attack. \n\nEvery evening the jabo's have been successfully bombing Allied advance columns along the Berlin - Hamburg autobahn causing great disruption.\n\nWatch out for RAF Tempest fighters which are very active in this sector - our new Ta152's should be more than a match for them.\n\nGood hunting - and good luck.\n\nSelect skin: Ta-152c-Tromp-11-Jaune-III-KG27.bmp\n
