Name Long nose Focke-Wulf pilot 17
Short Operation 'Wacht am Rhein' (1) 'The Battle of the Bulge'\n\n
Description Date: December 1944\nTime: 1000\nWeather: Rain/snow\nCloud height: 900m\n\nWe have been urgently ordered back to the Ardennes- 'something big is brewing?' and Winter has set in with a vengeance.\n\nToday we will carry out a fighter sweep covering Marmedy in the North, out to Rochefort in the West and back over Bastogne.\n We could catch out some  Allied fighter planes taking off or landing at their airfields. Keep an eye open for our own jet recon aircraft operating in the same area.\n Good luck - dismissed\n\nSelect skin: FW190D9_gelbe10_blank.bmp\n
