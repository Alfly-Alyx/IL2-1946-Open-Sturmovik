Name to Salzburg
Short to Salzburg\n\n
Description 28.4.45 - 13:30\nMission Weather:  Poor\n\nThe  Americans are nearing. There have been a lot of confusing orders going back and forth. But finally we are to leave Riem. A first detachment will leave today to Salzburg, another will fly into Innsbruck.\nI know, both airfields are insufficient for the jets but the best we have. At some time I expect an order to retreat to Prague but we will see to that then.\n\nInnsbruck may be just big enough to get in but from what we know the field is too short to get out again. The group that goes there will have to see to that.\nSalzburg is slightly bigger and may be big enough to get out again with 50% fuel or so.\n\nGround personel and equipment is already on the move and will continue to move out.\n\nYou are to lead the first kette to Salzburg.  Be careful.\n\nSkins: \nME-262-1a JV44 Blank 1.bmp \nor\nME-262-1a JV44 Blank 2.bmp\nwhichever you like better\n\
