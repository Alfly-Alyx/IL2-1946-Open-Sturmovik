Name to Salzburg
Short to Salzburg\n\n\n
Description 29.4.45 - 15:00\nMission Weather:  Hazy\n\nThis part of the story has some variations to it. I will tell it like this:\n\nGalland was in the hospital at the Tegernesee while all these movements happened. He had contact to Salzburg and B\u00E4r was the commader there.\n\nThe cause in Innsbruck was lost. Although attempts where made to build additional take off length, no mission was flown from there as the runway was too short and no supplies where there at all for the jets.\n\nIn Salzburg the accomodations where only slightly better and it is said in various sources that Heinz B\u00E4r flew his final mission from there where he encountered his last victim. This is his Mission from Salzburg on the 29th.\n(this is the part that varies wether the mission was from Salzburg or not - even Forsyth considers both possibilites)\n\nAchtung.\nWe have reports of low level fighters in the Rosenheim area. We are not done for yet. I will lead a pair or 262s and will attempt a takeoff to intercept. Be careful, as your tanks are only half full!\n\nNote:\nBar Me262A1a.bmp - markings off\n\n\n\n\n
