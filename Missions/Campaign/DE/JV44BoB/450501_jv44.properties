Short the end\n\n
Description 1.5.45 - 7:00\nMission Weather:  Poor\n\nSo this was it, the last flight with the Me-262. Here ends the operational history of JV-44. The legend is about to begin. The highest decorated unit ever with the best aircraf of the time. But the biggest achievement was perhaps, that most of the units members lived to see the end of the war!\n\nOn the early morning of May 1st, in his Tegernsee hospital, Adolf Galland briefed his Officer zbV Herget for a very special Mission. The Americans have already reached Munich and taken the small airfield of Schleissheim in the north. So he wrote a most unusual note and briefed Major Herget, the nightfighter ace, and Hauptmann Kessler to take the Storch and fly to that airfield as JV44s emissaries:\n\n'From Adolf Galland (Generalleutnant)\n'I have sent Major Herget as well as my personal aide, Captain Kessler, to the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in order to discuss with him the possibilities and terms of a special surrender of the last entire and fully operational jet fighter unit. I therefore kindly ask you to have me approached in this regard at the earliest possible time without any delay, since the destruction of the aircraft and special equipment as well as the disbandment of the unit should be expected at any hour.'\n\nWhat can be said? Fly right into the lions lair with the tiny Storch in no so bright weather and the threat of allied airpower... \n\nThey did as told.\nWill you?\n\nIn the end JV-44 finally surrendered on May 5th when the Americans reached Tegernsee and Salzburg.\n\nOn May 7th 1945, 7. Jagddivision reported that 'JV 44 (Me 262 IV/JG.7)' had been 'taken prisoner'.\n\nOn May 8th the war in Europe was over. \n\nSkin: standard - markings on
