Name the flying telephone pole
Short the flying telephone pole\n\n
Description 25.4.45 - 17:10\nMission Weather:  Poor\n\nThe day Berlin got surrounded, the day the US Army and the Red Army met in Torgau, splitting Germany in two. Little did one know in Riem yet, the news didn't come through that day since communications was vague and unreliable to say the least. \nIt would have made no difference.\n\nBack to business. \nWhile a detachment of Me-262 is already in action over Schwabm\u00FCnchen, another segment will attack a force that is headed for the Erding airfield.\nOne of the last oddities that Willi Herget brought from Augsburg is the U4. A Me-262 equipped with a Mauser 214 50mm canon. \nWell, now that we have it, we use it.  You will be accompanied by two regular turbos.\n\n\n\n
