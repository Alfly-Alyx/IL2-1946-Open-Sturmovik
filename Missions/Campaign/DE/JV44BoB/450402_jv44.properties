Short Krupinski meets P-38 over Innsbruck\n\n\n\n\n
Description 2.4.1945  13:00\nMission Weather:  Hazy\n\nGalland  had received word that Hauptmann Walter Krupinski was 'resting' at a recuperation centre for wounded and mentally strained Luftwaffe aircrew known as 'Florida' at Bad Wiessee, to the south of Munich on the Tegernsee. \n'It would have been the night of 1 April 1945. Steinhoff and Galland turned up completely unexpectedly at the recreation centre. I thought they were still up in the north at Brandenburg-Briest - I'd heard about this unit Galland had formed. In fact they had flown their aircraft down to Munchen-Riem that day and had come straight to Bad Wiessee. Steinhoff asked me if I wanted to fly the Me 262. I was astonished, but immediately said "Yes!'" \n\nWith its officer cadre of Steinhoff, Krupinski, Schnell, Hohagen, Fahrmann, Stigler and Neumann, backed up by experienced Unteroffizier and NCOs such as Nielinger, Schallmoser, Muller, Steiner, Dobnig, Knier and Kammerdiener, JV 44 was building a strong core of capable and experienced pilots.\n\nOn the 2nd, Krupinski got a short introduction on the ground and taxiing:\n\nWell, therea re few things that are different and have to be done a specific way. On takeoff hold the plane with the brakes. Very slowly throttle up to full power, over 8000rpm. then release the brakes and roll. Take off speed is above 200, close to 220 km/h. you will need all of the runway, you will see. \nThrottle movements only very gentle, to avoid flameouts or  burning engines. Also watch the engine temperatures all the time!\nAproach target area at 4 - 5000 m at high speeds. Use your speed and use altitude advantage. On fighters only make one pass. Never ever dogfight!\nLanding approach must be wide and gentle too. Approach at around 300km/h,  touchdown not lower than 200 km/h. you will also need a lot of runway, remember that.\nEverything understood? Questions? Well then, time for you first flight...\n\n...it was early afternoon as Krupinski headed south towards the Bavarian Alps, and as he crossed the Tegernsee, a message came over the radio from the controller at Riem warning of P-38 Lightnings over Innsbruck...\n\nSkins: \nME-262-1a JV44 Blank 1.bmp \nor\nME-262-1a JV44 Blank 2.bmp\nwhichever you like better\n\n\n\n\n
