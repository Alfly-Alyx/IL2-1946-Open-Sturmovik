Name JV44 - Battle over Bavaria
Short \n
Description Static campaign flying Messerschmitt Me-262 \n\nSelect highest rank\n\n"...word had got out that Galland was forming a new jet unit at Brandenburg so I called him from Lechfeld and asked whether I could join him... He said: "Sure, no problem, glad to have you.  Just bring a jet with you."   So I went over to the jet manufacturing plant at Leipheim and tried to get hold of an Me 262.  I said I was under instruction to collect the aircraft for JV 44, but they had never even heard of the unit!  Anyway, by that stage, things were in such turmoil that I managed to secure the aircraft and I then flew direct to Brandenburg-Briest"\nLeutnant Franz Stigler\n\nBy the end of March the unit was to go operational and was sent to Munich-Riem as Defence of the Reich in southern Germany to protect the aircraft industry and the depots there.\n\nWelcome in Bavaria!
