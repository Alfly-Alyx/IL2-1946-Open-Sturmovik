Description 27.4.45 - 10:45\nMission Weather:  Hazy\n\nGalland is in the Hospital!\nDefensive fire from a bomber hit him in the leg, shell splinters had to be taken out yesterday evening.\n\nSo from now on Oberst B\u00E4r will lead air operations. The General is well enough though to oversee everything from the ground. \n\nAnyway, no time to waste comrades!\nThe Thunderbolts are about to pay a visit. A pair get airborne just in time together with a few FW-190 to welcome them!\n\nNote:\nYou can use a red 13 skin as B\u00E4r was the leader and scored that day.\nBar Me262A1a.bmp - markings off\n\n\n
