Name 13 July 1942
Short Effort  to break the El Alamein box.\n
Description 13 Jul 1942 0800\n\n     The attack by the Australians down the coast road has been stopped. The main thrust of the 21st panzer division will now be directed towards the El Alamein box, in an effort to cut off the Austrailian forces.\n\n     Our job today will be to clear the area over the main armored thrust of enemy aircraft, so that the Stukas can make their bombing runs unopposed. The Geschwader's fuel situation is tenuous to say the least, but we will continue to fly as many aircraft as we can, when we can.\n\nBriefing:\n\nQTFA 131200 26505K P10K CLR\n\nMission Notes: the Allied forces are not subject to the same fuel and supply restrictions that we are.
