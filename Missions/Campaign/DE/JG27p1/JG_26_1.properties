Name June 22 1941
Short Attack the Soviet Union\n
Description June 22 1941 0200\n\n     Well, so much for the war winding down. Here we are in the sticks again. II Gruppe is based here at Berznicki. III Gruppe and the Geschwaderstab are living it up a little to the North of here in Suwalcki.\n\n     O.K., you are up early because today marks the start of the greatest Military Campaign the world has ever seen. We will succeed where Napoleon failed. Today, we invade the Soviet Union. Under operation "Barbarossa" we will begin our expansion by vigorously attacking Soviet airfields so that our Stukagruppen can make way for the Panzers undisturbed.\n\n     The first round of attacks will happen before sunrise. This is a compromise for the Wehrmacht who wishes to begin their artillery barrage at 0300. If we wait until daylight we will not be able to catch the Red Air Force on the ground. If the Wehrmacht waits until sunrise for us, they will lose the element of surprise as their positions will be visible to border observation posts. \n\n     Your target priority is as follows:\n\n1. The destruction of modern aircraft. MiG-3's and other modern monoplanes.\n\n2. Destruction of aircraft with "modern" engines. Il-2's for the most part fit into this category.\n\n3. Other aircraft. Biplanes and antiquated bombers should only be targeted when other high priority aircraft are not present.\n\nBriefing: \n\nBZKI 220000 08510 P10K BRK1.5K\n\nTake off: 0300\nRecovery: 0350\n\nAttack Altitude: 2000m\nTarget: Aircraft on fighter airfield Grid F14\n\nMission Notes: Members of the Geschwaderstab will fly high cover for us today.
