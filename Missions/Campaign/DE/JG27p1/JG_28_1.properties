Name July 4 1941
Short Provide air cover over the assault on Shumilno\n
Description July 4 1941 0800\n\n     The 20th Panzer Division has begun it's assault on the  City of Shumilno. This is their main objective to open the door to a Northern route to Vitebsk. With 7.Panzer Division making headway to the South, Vitebsk will be surrounded and the way will be clear to Smolensk. After Smolensk, Moscow.\n\n     This morning you will fly an air cover mission for elements of the 20th Panzer as they make their way into the city. Though the Red Air Force has been decimated for lack of a better term, in this sector as in others, single ground attack aircraft have been sneaking up to the lines in brazen hit and run attacks. These unescorted attacks though seemingly ineffective militarily, make your job today important. In a long campaign such as this, the Wehrmacht will no doubt need every tank, truck or other asset to see ultimate success.\n\nBriefing: \n\n041200 26510 P10K 0.6K BKN\n\nTakeoff: 0800\nRecovery: 0850\n\nPatrol Altitude: 2000m\nPatrol Area: Shumilno C14,15\n\nMission Notes:  ID before you fire.
