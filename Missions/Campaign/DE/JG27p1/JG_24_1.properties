There have been heavy casualties due to anti-tank guns and British tanks. The attack this morning was blunted for lack of a better term, so we will help the 9th break through. Air superiorty is no longer an issue so we will help the Kampfflieger in their mission.\n\n     Today, every aircraft that flies will carry a bomb. Except for the Storchs of course. The Stukas will destroy the anti-tank guns and tanks. Your job will be to spot reinforcements coming up the pass,and targeting them accordingly.\n\nKZNI 181200 18510 P10K CLRUNL\n\nTarget Area: Border of M11,M12 sectors\n\nMission Notes: Watch for friendly tanks.
