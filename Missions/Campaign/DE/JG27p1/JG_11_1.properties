Name 01 June 1940
Short Ju-88 escort over Dunkirk\n\n\n\n
Description 1 June 1940 1030\n\n     An all out effort is being mounted today to prevent the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force. Port facilities, Airfields and shipping will feel the full weight of our assault. It will be a difficult task for the Jagdgeschwadern to defend the Kampfgeschwadern, but it must be done.\n\n     Our piece of the puzzle will be to escort the Ju-88's of II.KG3 in their effort to render the Port facilites in the area of Dunkirk unuseable. There will be many attacks and patrols underway at the same time, so aircraft and target ID will be of the utmost importance.\n\nBriefing:\n\nSTOM 010600 28030K 5K OVC0.9K\nTO: 0700\nREC:0750\n\nEscort: II.KG3 to and from target area Grid K10.\nEscort Altitude: 5000m\n\nMission Notes: Visibility near the ground is bad.
