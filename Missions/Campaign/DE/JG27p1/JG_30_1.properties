Name 06 Oct 1941
Short Combat air patrol of the Tobruk area.\n
Description 06 Oct 1941 0500\n\n     We have been in Africa only a couple of days, and already some of you have been scoring well. It seems that we were not destined for the frigid Russian winter after all. I Gruppe has been here since April getting the most out of their old Emil's. One of the benefits of our arrival is that I Gruppe is being able to rotate back to Germany, staffel by staffel to take delivery of their new Friedrichs.\n\n     This morning we will fly another patrol over the area of Tobruk, which has been under siege by the Afrika Korps for some time. A schwarm from I Gruppe will lead the patrol as they are still much more familiar with the area than we are. Our morning flight will be further accompanied by a schwarm from 6.Staffel.\n\nBriefing:\n\nAIEG 060600 33010 P10K CLR\n\nPatrol altitude: 3500m\nPatrol area. Tobruk Garrison.
