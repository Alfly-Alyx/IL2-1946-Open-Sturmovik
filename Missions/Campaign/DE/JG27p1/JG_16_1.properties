Short Freie Jagd\n\n\n\n
Description 20 Aug, 1940 0530\n\n     On the 18th, it was decided that due to the importance and heroic success in battle of our Stukageschwadern, that the Ju-87 Gruppen will undergo a period of rotation to be at maximum strength for operations to come.\n\n     Due to this tactical change, today we have enough aircraft on hand to conduct an early morning Freie Jagd over British territory. We will clear the airspace in our assigned area for the mornings later strike aircraft. We will fly in low, and be over the target early so that we can destroy the British fighters on the ground.\n\nBriefing:\n\nCHBG 220000 20525K 5K OVC1.0K\n\nTO: 0600\nREC: 0650\n\nFighter Sweep: Low altitude H10.\n\nMission Notes: AA will be heavy over the target area.
