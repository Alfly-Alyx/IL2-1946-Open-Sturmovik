Description 26 May 1942, 1430\n\n     The attack has begun! The Afrika Korps and Gruppe Cruewell have begun their drive east. With the ultimate aim of securing the Suez canal, and further isolating Allied forces in the Mittelmeeraum. The English seem to have limitless resources. And with Malta still continuing to hold out, our supply situation becomes worse by the day.\n\n     Much like the other missions we have flown recently, this will be a patrol.  JG27 will cover advancing elements of the 21st Panzer Division as they engage British forces  to dislodge them from positions overlooking the Via Balbia.\n\nBriefing:\n\nMTBA 261200 08515K P10K BKN0.5K\n\nPatrol Altitude: 3500m\nPatrol Area: C2,C1\n\nMission Notes: We continue to see enemy fighters in the air day after day.
