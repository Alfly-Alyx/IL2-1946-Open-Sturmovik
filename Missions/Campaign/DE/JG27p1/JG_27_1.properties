Description June 25 1941 1500\n\n     A great piece of intel has just come through. As you might have expected, the Russians are doing everything that they can to slow our advance. They are attempting to reinforce the Shumilno area with more men and ammunition. One of our Ju-88 recon flights has spotted two trains on the Vitebsk-Shumilno line and has placed them between Zaranovo and Blizhnee at 1430. Your aircraft shold be refueled and rearmed by about 1500.\n\n    A Staffel of Stukas and a Staffel of Ju-88's has been dispatched to intercept these two trains and destroy them. We will fly a loose fighter sweep for the Stukas prior to their arrival. And then we will continue our patrol until the trains are destroyed. The train depot at Blizhnee is their secondary target. This is a high priorty target, so other friendly aircraft may happen upon it. Keep an eye out for ground fire, which is expected to be heavy to say the least.\n\nBriefing: \n\nBZKI 251200 26510 P10K CLR\n\nTake off: 1500\nRecovery: 1550\n\nPatrol Altitude: 2000m\nPatrol Area: D14\n\nMission Notes: A schwarm from 5.Staffel will fly with us today.
