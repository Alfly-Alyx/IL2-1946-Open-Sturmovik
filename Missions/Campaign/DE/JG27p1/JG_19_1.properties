Name 20 Sep, 1940
Short Geschwader Strength Free Hunt.\n
Description 20 Sep, 1940 1400\n\n     The weather today is bad. The bombers are grounded for now, so we all know what this means. Freie Jagd. The first two outings of the day were unsuccessfull in the attempt to bring the RAF up to fight. Due to accidents and other attrition, most Staffeln can only provide 6 or 8 aircraft. Because of this, it is of the utmost importance that you bring your aircraft back. In any case we will mount a patrol over the channel, and see what we can come up with...\n \n    Our free hunt today will include all three deployed Gruppen of JG27. Our Geschwaderstab is burdened with administrative duties and will only fly two operations today.  We will meet our other Gruppen over France, climb to our patrol altitude and make our way over the channel.\n\nBriefing:\n\nCHBG 201200 12520K U5K SHW0.6K\n\nTO: 1400\nREC: 1450\n\nCombat Air Patrol: Patrol Altitude 6000m\nPatrol Area: I10 to F10 East to West.\n\nMission Notes: Weak enemy air action is possible, but not likely.
