Name 1 Feb 1942
Short Move to Martuba, and escort Stukas as they attack supply points behind Allied lines.\n
Description 1 Feb 1942, 1100\n\n     On the 29th of January, Rommel's forces recaptured Benghazi. At this time, the Afrika Korps is making its way to consolidation positions on the Gazala frontier to solidify our position in the area.\n\n     While all of our Gruppen and the Geschwaderstab are all together and operating in the same area, most of our Staffeln are only functioning at about %50 due to operating conditions, supply issues and combat losses. As a Geschwader, however, we can still field quite a force.\n\n     Today, A Schwarm from each Gruppen will participate on an escort mission with the Stukas of I.StG3 to destroy enemy supply positions in the Gazala area. While the size of our recent engagements with the English have been in comparison, smaller than those in the past, most of these engagements are fought at a high level of intensity by the best pilots that both our sides can muster. So, do your best to keep your wing men alive, as they are the only ones are working to keep you alive.\n\nBriefing:\n\nMTBA 010600 08515K P10K BRK1.5K\n\nEscort Altitude: 3000m\nTarget Area: Gazala supply points (C4)\n\nMission Notes: Expect heavy AAA and enemy fighters over the target area.\n\nPlayer Skin: TunF4Blank.bmp\nMarkings: On\n\nTemplate by Sierraxray.\n
