Name 12 May 1940
Short BARCAP\n
Description 12 May 1940 0930\n\n     Today is a busy day.  Our job will be to fly air patrols over a set of bridges over the Albert Canal that were captured by 6th Army this morning. The enemy will no doubt mount a desparate effort to dissable these bridges. We must keep the bridges intact. The amount of traffic we can get over these bridges will shorten the amount of time it takes to advance to the Meuse considerably. Fighting is still going on in the town, but snipers have succeded up to this point in keeping sabateurs off of the bridge.\n\n     Due to the heavy flight schedule and aircraft  maintenance, our patrol will be augmented by members of 5.Staffel and the Geschwaderstab. Oberstleutnant Ibel will lead.\n\nBriefing:\n\nKRFD 120600 35015K P10K BKN1.5K\nTO: 0900\nREC:0950\n\nPatrol Area: Grids E2 and E3\nPatrol Altitude: 3500m\n\nMission Notes: These bridges are expected to be a point of effort for the enemy. \n\nPlayer Skin: Bf109E_JG27_V2_Blank.bmp\nMarkings: On\n\n
