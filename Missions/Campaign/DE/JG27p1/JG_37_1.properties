Name 9 July 1942
Short Convoy escort from Quotaifiya dispersals\n
Description 9 Jul 1942 0800\n\n     We have barely managed to keep pace with Rommel's armor. The Afrika Korps has managed to rout the British halfway across the Egyptian frontier, and has paused now at El Alamein. \n\n     Our Gruppen have been dispersed at a recently acquired piece of prime real estate in the dunes at Quotaifya. Not much there except a runway, but hopefully our supply system will catch up to us in the coming days. To help the supply system, we are tasked with providing aircover for a sea convoy as they make their way to one of our newly occupied harbours.\n\nBriefing:\n\nQTFA 090600 34510K P10K CLR\n\nMission Notes: Conserve fuel on this mission. Be sure to keep an eye out for submarines. Subs are the primary threat to our convoys.\n\nPlayer skin: TunF4Blank\nMarkings: On\n
