We will begin at dawn, with a scale of destruction the likes of which was heretofore, inconcievable. All Luftflotten will be engaged in battles up and down the English coast, and far inland. The coming operations will surely destroy the RAF in a week maybe less.\n\nHail victory!! " \n\n     Our mission has been postponed by the High Command due to the weather.

A Schwarm from 6.Staffel is coming along to add a few guns to the mission. \n\nBriefing:\n\nCHBG 131200 17515K 7K BRK1.5K\n\nTO: 1500\nREC: 1550\n\nEscort: II/StG 77 to and from target area H10.\nEscort Altitude: 3000m\n\nMission Notes: Also participating in this raid are two Staffeln of Stukas from I/StG 77 escorted by members of I Gruppe and the Geschwaderstab.\nAA will be heavy over the target area.
