Short Combat Air Patrol\n
Description 16 June 1940, 1800\n\nOn 6 June you were transfered to the newly arrived II.Gruppe of JG27. You are now assigned to 4.Staffel.\n\n     Our effort to expel the British from Europe was successfull. Paris was occupied on the 14th and we continue to push further to the south. \n\n     At the end of the month, we are scheduled to return to Germany to re-equip with the new Bf-109 E-4 model. It is no secret that our E-1's and E-3's are due for an overhaul. After today's earlier actions, it is even surprising that we are able to field seven aircraft for todays final event.\n\n     This evening we will fly cover for a staffel of Stuka's as they support Hoth's Panzer Corps' movement through Normandy.\n             \n\nBriefing:\n\nCRPQ 161200 13505K 10K SCT1.1K\nTO: 1800\nREC: 1850\n\nPatrol Area: Area surrounding St. Lo, (C6)\nPatrol Altitude: 3000m\n\nMission Notes: You will meet the Sturzkampfflieger in sector F5 and fly a loose escort to their target area.
