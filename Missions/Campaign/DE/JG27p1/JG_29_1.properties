Name July 7 1941
Short Move to foreward airfield at Bogushevsk\n
Description July 7 1941 1630\n\n     The Soviet 153rd Rifle Regiment is in total retreat down the road east toward Vitebsk. The 20th panzer division has sent elements in pursuit to assure the destruction of the Soviet unit.\n\n     We have a long mission ahead of us. I know that some of you have flown two and three sorties today, but hopefully this new order that just came down from the Jafu will get us through one more. On return from this sortie, the Gruppe will make it's way down to the newly captured forward airfield at Bogushevsk (F10). There, we will turn over our aircraft to our III.Gruppe. Tomorrow, we will board Ju-52's back to our previous field, pack up our things and equipment, and head back to Germany to begin conversion on the new F model Bf109.\n\n     First, we must provide cover for the 20th Panzer as they make their way down the Vitebsk road. Prowling Sturmoviks have been reasonably common in this area, though they have only been escorted by dated aircraft, I-153's, I-16's or maybe one or two MiGs. Still, I don't want to pack up your things as well as mine the night before we leave, so don't die. To your planes!...\n\nBriefing: \n\n071200 26510 P10K SCT1.0K\n\nTake off: 1700\nRecovery: 1820\n\nPatrol Altitude: 2000m\nPatrol Area: Vitebsk road (D14)\n\nMission Notes:  ID before you fire.
