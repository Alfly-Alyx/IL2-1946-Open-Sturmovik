Name April 21 1941
Short Jabo Raid on Airfield\n
Description 21 April 1941 0600\n\n      On the 19th Ioannina was captured, cutting the final supply line to the 1st Greek Army in Albania. Refusing to surrender to Italians (understandably), 1st Greek surrendered to an SS division on their flank the next day.\n\n     We have moved to an airfield near the port town of Arta. Our objective this morning is to destroy aircraft and defenses around the coastal town of Mesolongion. Our ground forces are moving down the coast to occupy the town. Word has it, that at the end of the month, IIGruppe will be headed back to Germany for another rest and refit. This is great news, hopefully the war is winding down.\n\nKZNI 210000 25015 7K BRK01.5K\n\nTarget Area: Airfield at Mesolongion, O8\n\nMission Notes: We will be one of many strike groups, coming from many directions.
