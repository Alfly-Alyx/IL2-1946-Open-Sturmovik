Name 10 Oct 1940
Short Harbour Attack\n
Description 10 Oct, 1940 0530\n\n     The last couple of weeks have seen a good bit of action,and due to losses we have been working hard to accomplish the assigned missions. More of the same today. Ever since the Stukageschwadern were rotated, the Jagdwaffe has had to participate more and more in Jabo operations. We will go in a relatively small formation at high altitude and high speed to maintain the advantage that the performance of the Bf109 provides us.\n \n    One of our staffeln in IIIGruppe have reiceved their new Bf109E7's with integrated bomb attachments and an uprated engine. We will escort them to their target area, and after they have released their weapons, we will all engage in a free hunt as ammunition and fuel permit.\n\nBriefing:\n\nCHBG 090000 20530K 7K OVC1.5K\n\nTO: 0600\nREC: 0650\n\nEscort: 9.JG27 As they conduct a Jabo raid against English port facilities. \n\nMission Notes: AA will be heavy over the target area.
