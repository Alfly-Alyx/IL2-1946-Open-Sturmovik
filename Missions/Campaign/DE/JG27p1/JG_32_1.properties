Short Evacuate airfield\n
Description 07 Dec 1941 0600\n\n     Our Gruppenkomanndeur Hauptmann Lippert was shot down on 23 Novermber, though he was seen to have bailed out of his stricken craft and there were witnesses to a good chute, we fear for his safety and hope that he will return shortly. In the meantime, let us continue our trend of excellent performance for our new Kommandeur, Oberleutnant Rodel.\n\n     The siege of Tobruk has been broken, and the Afrika Korps is in the process of an orderly withdrawl in a westerly direction. As a result of this change in fortune, and a large English armored force that is amassed to the east of us. We will be evacuating our current airfield for a new base to the Southwest at Tmimi.\n\n     This morning, elements of I and II Gruppen will perform a covering patrol for the airfield's remaining aircraft that must still evacuate. A flight of Ju-52's that are carrying members of our maintenance crews and a pair of recently repaired machines from III Gruppe will depart when they are able. See that they reach Tmimi. When they are safe, make your way to the airfield at Tmimi.\n\nBriefing:\n\nAIEG 070000 35510 5K  BRK1.5K\n\nPatrol Area: Gazala airfield (B3)\nPatrol Altitude: 2500m\n\nMission Notes: You will most likely sight the approaching enemy armored group in the east.
