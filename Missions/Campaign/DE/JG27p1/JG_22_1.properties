Short Fighter sweep\n
Description 9 April 1941 0800\n\n     I hope that you enjoyed your period of leave and conversion training on our new aircraft back in Germany. Now it is time to get back to work. II and III Gruppen have moved into Bulgaria. We are going to support a movement South through Yugoslavia and into Greece. I Gruppe is preparing to deploy to North Africa to help the Italians down there, while we help the Italians up here.\n\n     The 2nd panzer division is in action near the mountain town of Monastir. It is their intention to breach the defences at Monastir and push south through the gap in the mountains to their objective of Vevi, Greece. This will open a door down the Vardar valley to the south of Greece.\n\n     Our mission is to patrol the area over the axis of advance, to ensure that neither the 2nd Panzer or our Stukas are bothered by enemy aircraft.\n\nBriefing:\n\nBLCA 090000 08510K P10K CLRUNL\n\nPatrol Altitude: 3000m\nPatrol Area: Area surrounding GridT9\n\nMission Notes: Varied and intermittent opposition is expected. Do not stray from the patrol area. Heavy partisan activity in unoccupied areas will almost assure your capture if you are shot down.\n\nPlayer Skin: Mangas_Bf-109E-4_Lippert_nm.bmp\nMarkings: On\n\n\n
