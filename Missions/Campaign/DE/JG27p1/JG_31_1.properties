Name 23 Nov 1941
Short Operation Crusader.\n
Description 23 Nov 1941 1400\n\n     The British 8th Army has begun an offensive with the apparent goal of reaching the besieged garrison at Tobruk. It would be to our ultimate benefit to keep this from occuring as we do not want to fight the same force twice, as this would occur if the surrounded garrison was relieved or resupplied. We have seen heavy combat in this area in preparation for the coming offensive and as a result our Gruppen's ground crew have been hard pressed to supply us with serviceable aircraft. We must keep up the pressure on the British, and to that end, we must continue to fly.\n\n     This afternoon's mission will be a Combat Air Patrol over the Southern approaches to Tobruk. There will be Stukas and other Schlachtflieger in the area. They don't need escort, however they do need to have the area cleared of enemy fighters before their arrival. There seems to be a faucet that is spouting American-built fighters, so be prepared for combat that rivals if not exceeds the previous days.\n\nBriefing:\n\nAIEG 231200 03005 P10K CLR\n\nPatrol Area: D3\nPatrol Altitude: 3000m\n\nMission Notes: While this is a CAP, do your best to keep friendly Schlachtflugzuegen from being shot down.
