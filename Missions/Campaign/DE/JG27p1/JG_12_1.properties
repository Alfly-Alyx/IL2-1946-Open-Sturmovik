Name 3 June 1940
Short Combat Air Patrol\n
Description 3 June 1940, 0630\n\n     The BEF is on the verge of defeat due to our successes in the Dunkirk pocket. While the destruction of the fighting ability of the retreating British is important, we are still heavily engaged with French forces to the South. \n\n     To that end, 2. JG27 has been assigned a Combat Air Patrol over a flight path that has frequently been used by the British Bomber Command to rendezvous with fighter escorts to conduct raids on our assets in this area. This has a twofold benefit. We will thin the ranks of bombers before they reach the target area, and strip them of their fighter escort so that aircraft defending the target itself will have a much easier time.\n\nBriefing:\n\nSTPL 030600 27010K 10K SCT1.5K\nTO: 0700\nREC: 0750\n\nPatrol Area: Airspace over Vire (E3)\nPatrol Altitude: 5000m\n\nMission Notes: Mind your fuel state on these long patrols.
