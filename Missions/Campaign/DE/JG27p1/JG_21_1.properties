Description 30 Oct, 1940 1500\n\n     This has been a difficult campaign for all units involved. You have all given alot, and the Geschwaderkommodore is proud. In two weeks we will be rotated back to Germany to refit and rearm. But now, we have more business to take care of.\n \n    This Afternoon, we will patrol the Channel to report on shipping or the presence of enemy aircraft and their location. Conditions are bad today, so we must be careful to return with everybody and their aircraft intact.\n\nBriefing:\n\nCHBG 301200 20540K U5K SHW1.0K\n\nTO: 1500\nREC: 1550\n\nPatrol Area: G9 to D9 East to West\nPatrol Altitude: 500m\n\nMission Notes: If you must ditch, Sea Rescue is on station in G9.\n\nPlayer skin: IIJG_27_BoB_V6.bmp\nMarkings: On\n \nTemplate by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n
