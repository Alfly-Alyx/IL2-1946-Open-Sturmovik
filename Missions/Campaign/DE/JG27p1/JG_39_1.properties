Description 19 Aug 1942 1730\n\n     A lull has set up over the fronts in the El alamein area. The last couple of weeks have seen no major movements on either side, on the ground, or in the air. It is now keenly felt by our side, the failure of our forces to capture Malta. The tanker that had the fuel for the next armored offensive, as well as our fuel was lost on the 13th of this month en route to Tobruk.\n\n     While our fuel situation can best be described as critical, and there has been little enemy armored movement, we must continue to employ our resources to the greatest offensive effect. To this end, we will escort a Schwarm of Stukas as they continue to disrupt the enemy's ability to resupply.\n\nBriefing:\n\nQTFA 191200 26505K P10K CLR\n\nMission Notes: The enemy's supply columns are expected to be well defended.\n\nPlayer skin: TunF4blank\nMarkings: On\n\n     \n
