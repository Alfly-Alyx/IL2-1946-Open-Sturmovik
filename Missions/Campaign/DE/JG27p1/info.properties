Name JG27p1
Description A semi-historical campaign featuring you, as a JG27 pilot, trying to make it through WWII alive. \n\nI recommend starting this campaign at the rank of Oberfeldwebel or Leutnant. Also, make sure that the "No instant success" option is turned off in the difficulty settings. \n\nIn this Campaign, you will find yourself tested on nearly every front, and against every enemy that JG27 faced in the first two years of WWII. \n\nAbove all, thanks for taking the time to download and fly this B50 campaign. Keep an eye out for JG27partII in the coming months. 1943-1945 on version 4.08 \n\n~S~,\nB50
