Name 15  Feb 1942
Short Evening patrol, strafe supply columns.\n
Description 15 Feb 1942, 1800\n\n     The Afrika Korps is positioned on the Gazala line, and is in a resupply mode after the last few months of intense battles. This reduction in the pace of operations will help us as well. We should be able to replace losses in equipment and personnel, so we will be ready for the next big push into Egypt over the coming months.\n\n     This evening's mission is a medium altitude armed patrol over the enemy's rear supply lines between Tobruk and Gazala. You are directed to harass and destroy if possible any supply vehicles that you come across in your patrol sector.\n\nBriefing:\n\nMTBA 151800 08515K P10K BRK1.5K\n\nPatrol Altitude: 1000m\nPatrol Area: D3\n\nMission Notes: We will fly with a Schwarm of Italians that will be our cover, as our eyes will be low searching for vehicles.
