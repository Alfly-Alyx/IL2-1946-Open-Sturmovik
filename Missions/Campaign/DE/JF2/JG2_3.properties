Name JF23
Description 27 August 1942\n\nWe have a new enemy! In recent weeks, we have started to encounter a new shape in the skies over France... a very large shape! The American 8th Air Force have begun flying their B17 four engine bombers on sorties over our territory. Reports say these "dicke autos" are heavily armed and pack considerable defensive fire. \n\nRadar reports a formation of high flying aircraft returning across our sector. Try and knock one of these heavies down, but beware, as they may have their Spitfire escort with them.\n
