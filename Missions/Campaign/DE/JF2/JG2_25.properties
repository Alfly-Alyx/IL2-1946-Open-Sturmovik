Name JF43
Description 5 May 1943\n\nThis morning the heavies of the American 8th Air Force are back on their high altitude excursions over our Airfields. \n\nOur experience against these formidable opponents suggests the best chance of success results from head-on attacks rather than the standard attacks from astern. This is how we will be making our attacks from now on. In addition, the last few months has seen the increasing occurence of a new shape in the skies high over Normandy... the American B24, which they call the Liberator.\n\nTogether with elements of II/JG2, we are to intercept these intruders.\n
