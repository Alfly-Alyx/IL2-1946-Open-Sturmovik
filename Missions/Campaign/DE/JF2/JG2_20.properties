Name JF40
Description 16 March 1943\n\nIts looking like we will be spared the final battles here in North Africa as we have just received word that soon we will be transferring back to Normandy to rejoin the rest of the Geschwader. \n\nToday, however, we are assigned to escort a group of the huge Me323 transports in to Kairouan airfield. Make sure they arrive safely!\n
