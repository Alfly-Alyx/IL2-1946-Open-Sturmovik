Name JF21
Description 30 July 1942\n\nWelcome back to France! Your high scoring exploits in the East have earned you recognition in the higher echelons of the Jagdwaffe, and now you have been rewarded with command of your own Staffel.\n\nAs Staffelkapitan of 7./JG2 you will be flying the new Fw190 against the RAF. Whilst our pilots still enjoy a technical superiority over the enemy's Spitfire MkVb's, the RAF are well organised and a much more formidable foe than the Russians, so be careful!\n\nYour first mission in command will be an evening sweep along the Normandy coast.\n
