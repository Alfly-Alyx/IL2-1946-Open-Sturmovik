Name JF22
Description 19 August 1942\n\nThe Tommies have had the audacity to try and land an invasion force on the beaches near Dieppe, but the Luftwaffe has been bombing them back into the sea all morning. The RAF has assembled a massive air umbrella to support the operation, however, our colleagues from JG26 have exacted a heavy toll on their fighters. Now it is our turn!\n\nYour Staffel will join the rest of II/JG2 and elements from I/JG2 on a Freie Jagd to the invasion area. Beware, however, as on our last mission we encountered a new Spitfire variant which showed much improved characteristics.\n
