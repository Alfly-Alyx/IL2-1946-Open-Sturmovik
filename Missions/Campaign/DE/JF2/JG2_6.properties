Name JF26
Description 21 November 1942\n\nAfter a short stop-over in Sicily, we have arrived in Tunisia to re-inforce the Afrikakorps who, after the Anglo-American landings in North West Africa a couple of weeks ago, are now under attack from both sides by the combined might of the Allied 1st and 8th Armies. Operating under the command of JG53 flying from Kairouan airbase, our objective will be to protect our forces on the Battlefield from Allied fighter and bomber attacks. As the only Fw190 unit operating in this theatre, we should enjoy advantage over the Allied P40's, P39's, Hurricanes and Spitfires.\n\nThis morning you will lead your Staffel on a familiarisation flight alongside our fellow Jagdflieger of 2./JG53 who will fly top cover.\n
