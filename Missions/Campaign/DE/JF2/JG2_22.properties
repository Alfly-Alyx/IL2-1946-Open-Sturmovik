Name JF41
Description 21 April 1943\n\nWelcome back to Normandy... again! Tunisia may not have been the frying pan, but proceedings here on the Channel Front are not so much a fire but fast assuming the proportions of a full scale conflagration! In addition to having to deal with the RAF's many Circuses, Rhubarbs, Ramrods, Rangers and Roadsteads, we are encountering the American heavies on a more and more frequent basis. \n\nYour successes in Tunisia have not gone un-noticed, however, and you have been offered the post of Gruppen-Adjutant with III/JG2.\n\nThis morning the RAF are returning from another Circus operation, and our Gruppe, together with elements of your old II Gruppe, recently converted wholly back onto Gustavs, will rise to the challenge.\n
