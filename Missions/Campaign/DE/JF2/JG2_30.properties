Name JF50
Description 16 August 1943\n\nCongratulations! You have just received a telegram from the General de Jagdflieger informing you of your promotion to a staff position in light of your excellent leadership in these hard times we are facing. You are to leave for Berlin tomorrow morning by train to receive your orders.\n\nThe Americans are attacking our airfields again, however, and this may be your last chance for a while to bag yourself a kill! Try and intercept them before they reach their targets. The Gustavs of II Gruppe, with their superior high altitude performance, will again tackle the fighters leaving our Gruppe free to concentrate on the bombers.\n
