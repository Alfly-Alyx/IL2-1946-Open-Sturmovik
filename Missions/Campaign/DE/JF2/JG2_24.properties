Name JF48
Description 14 July 1943\n\nThe Americans have begun operating several Groups of fighters recently. Our fellow pilots report these P47's as being heavy, unwieldly aircraft, however, they do apparently posses excellent high altitude and dive characteristics, so think twice before split S-ing away from this enemy!\n\nThis evening's patrol over the Normandy bocage has so far been uneventful. With fuel running low, ground control has ordered us to return to base.\n
