Description All or Nothing at All.\n\nDate: July 19, 1944\n          1232\nWeather: Good\nCloud Base: 1,100 m\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\n\n"Hauptmann."\n\nI turned around and saw the glossy face of General Seidemann, the old war fox, with career dating back to the Kondor Legion in Spain. This was the sixth time we've met this month. \n\n"Herr General."\n\nI snapped at attention and saluted the man. He smiled and saluted me back.\n\n"Can we talk somewhere?"\n\nWe walked out of the mess hall together. The place was empty, all of the fighter pilots stationed here scrambled to intercept Boeings up north, so no one stared at the sight of the Kommandierender General of an entire Fleigerkorps talking to some Hauptmann.\n\nWe went into a small park on the airfield grounds, and stopped under one of the trees.\n\n"Is your group ready to support us when the need comes?"\n\nI dreaded this moment.\n\n"Herr General... I have the support of three pilots, the three of my best friends. The rest of the squadron is still unaware, and I'm not sure I could..."\n\n"How many planes do you have?"\n\n"I've only ordered four Arados to be assembled, for the four of us. The others will have nothing to fly, even if they oppose us."\n\n"Hmm, four is quite good, better than I expected... We are trying to approach Goering, but it is difficult. He may be much easier to convince once the Fuehrer is dead."\n\n"Yes, Herr General... Do you know the date now?"\n\nSeidemann smiled and put his gloved hand on my shoulder.\n\n"Tomorrow."\n\n"Herr Hauptmann! Herr Hauptmann!"\n\nWe both jumped back and turned around. A young NCO ran towards us from the HQ building. \n\n"Herr Hauptmann!" The kid stopped and bent in half, trying to catch his breath. "You're a fighter pilot, right?"\n\n"Me? No. I do ground attack. Those are my Arado jets parked in the blastpens out there."\n\n"Oh..." The young man looked desperate. "Why did I think you were with a fighter squadron? Damn! There's a damaged Boeing flying over there, and we have no fighters left to scramble! Maybe, are any of your other pilots former fighter pilots? We still have an old Focke-Wulf..."\n\n"Why a Focke Wulf?" The General smiled. "Hauptmann, If I were you, I'd take my Arado up there and show those Amis what a pair of 20-mms and a jet could do."\n\n"Well, of course, but... Sir, those cannons are in the tail, not in the nose..."\n\n"They are?" Seidemann looked stunned. "But I thought..."\n\n"No. They're in a stationary tail stinger. They're worthless, only useful to give the enemy a scare, nothing more."\n\n"Hmm." The General rubbed his chin. "Why don't you try it anyway? I haven't flown in a long time, but I imagine this can be done. Get on his six, fly right under him, and as soon as you pass him, bob your nose a bit and press the trigger. Should hit him right in that glass nose. It's a big bomber, he can't maneuver."\n\nI didn't know what to say. The NCO stared at us with his mouth wide open. I smiled.\n\n"All right, Feldwebel. You have a car? Take me to my plane." \n\n
