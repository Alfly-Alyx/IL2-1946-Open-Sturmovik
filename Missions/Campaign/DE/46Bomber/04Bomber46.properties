Description Ludwigsfelde.\n\t\nDate: July 20, 1944\n          2110\nWeather: Good\nCloud Base: 1,200 m\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\n\nAirfield personnel surrounded our airplanes after we landed.\n\n"What's going on out there? Is the Fuhrer really dead? Is there going to be peace?"\n\nEveryone in the crowd had their own questions. I waved at them to be silent, and climbed up on the wing of my plane.\n\n"My fellow Germans!" I yelled. "Please, quiet down. My name is Hauptmann Schlammer. I'm the commander of these new fast bombers. Me and my friends have been flying missions in support of Germany's government, trying to prevent civil war from breaking out."\n\nThe crowd murmured.\n\n"Please listen! Friends, we need all of your help. Do not listen to provocation. Do not believe the rumors. General Beck and Dr Goerdeler are in full control of Berlin, and of most of the rest of the country. General von St\u00FClpnagel in Paris is negotiating for a peace with the Western Allies. We never wanted war with those great nations, and now is our chance for peace. If the negotiations are successful, then we can shift our entire might to the East, and crush the communist beast! In this, we'll need your full support."\n\nThe crowd was strangely quiet, and I was running out of words. I couldn't imagine what those men felt. Did they believe me? Were they happy? Were they about to revolt?\n\n"Friends! In my capacity as the representative of the new government, I would like to lead you all in pledging an oath of allegiance to the new government, and to the new Germany. I, state your name, do hereby pledge..."\n\nI made up some grand-sounding pledge on the spot. When only a few voices began to repeat the first part, my heart sank; but after a few seconds the voices grew, and soon the entire crowd was chanting the oath with me.\n\n"Long live Germany!" I yelled.\n\n"Long live Germany!" the crowd boomed in unison, and then broke out in cheering. I could barely control myself as I climbed off the wing. I was shaking, and my heart was just about jumping out of my chest.\n\nWe spent the rest of the afternoon sitting by the telephone. The rest of my pilots now joined us, asking about our involvement with the new government. No news came from the radio, which played the same Wagner record over and over again, occasionally intermixed with the recording of General Beck's speech. As the sun began to set, I began to hope that we'd need to kill no more Germans. Just then, the phone rang.\n\n"Hauptmann Schlammer here."\n\n"This is General Beck. Thank you, Hauptmann, for your help today. It was more than invaluable. However, it appears that your strike on the SS headquarters did not hit its mark. The Reichsfuhrer is still alive, and is attempting to organize resistance."\n\n"I see, sir."\n\n"Now, I know that it's getting dark, but you need to take off immediately and fly to Ludwigsfelde. We've just received a report that the SS is bringing in tanks and heavy artillery to that village just outside of Berlin. We are sending tanks into the area, before the SS can fully organize, and we'd like to precede it with an air strike. I have full confidence in you. Bring the largest bombs your wonder plane can carry. Their staging area appears to be the railway station. I'm sure you can find it on the map."\n\nThe old general hung up the phone without waiting for my answer. I looked at my friends, and then unfolded the Berlin map. The town was close enough. The mission should be quick. I looked up at them.\n\n"Friends. We have one more mission today. Traitors from the SS are using this village as a staging area. We must prevent them from attacking Berlin. Just like the last time, we'll send two planes 30 seconds ahead of the main strike at low level for flak suppression. Since we're not sure where the flak is located, you will have to improvise. If the flak is light, hit the main target. Myself and a wingman will be right behind you, and we'll dive bomb the railway station for greater accuracy."\n\nVictor Kuffner, one of my younger pilots, looked at me with his eyes wide open.\n\n"Sir... My family is in Ludwigsfelde. I grew up there. How..."\n\n"I'm sorry, Victor. You understand that I cannot abort this mission, or make any promises. We'll try to be as precise as we can. Killing my fellow Germans is hard, but if we leave them be, soon they'll start a full scale civil war, and the casualties will be much higher."\n\n"I understand, sir. But please... They're the large white house with a red roof on the East side of town. On Taubenstrasse..."\n\n"We'll be careful, Victor."\n\n
