Description Brother against Brother.\n\nDate: July 20, 1944\n          1600\nWeather: Broken Clouds\nCloud Base: 700 m\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\n\nAs we landed, I saw the other two Arados towed onto the airstrip. The cockpits were empty; trying to get them on the radio would be useless. I taxied towards the refueling area and motioned for the mechanics to start readying my plane. Then I jumped out of the cockpit and ran towards the flight line. Kirschner and Brandt were getting ready to fly.\n\n"Franz! Erich! What's going on?"\n\n"A lot of sporradic resistance. Unorganized so far. We're ordered to bomb an airfield to the south that's launching attacks all over the place."\n\n"We've heard some 190s on the radio getting attacked by the Me-262 jets."\n\n"That would be them. Are you coming with us?"\n\n"If you'll wait an hour or so for my plane to be readied. I think you should wait. If those guys also control the flak guns, things can get very hairy."\n\nKirschner nodded. I called Werner over and we drove back to the headquarters, where we became our own intel. The maps of all airfields in the area were easily available, and we studied the plans of the target airfield. The runway ran almost exactly east-west, and there were two prepared flak positions, to the south-east, and to the north-west. Kirschner and Brandt gave each other long looks after seeing that; they almost ran into that flak head-first.\n\n"I wish we've had more planes." I told them. "Unfortunately, with just four, we have no room for error. Franz and Erich will attack the flak guns, and me and Werner will hit the flight line. We'll go in at low level to delay detection, and minimize the chances of an air attack. We obviously won't have any escort. The flak suppression flight will go 30 seconds ahead of the strike group."\n\n"From which direction?" Erich sounded gloomy, unhappy with getting the more difficult task. \n\n"Good question. If we go from the north, it'll be easier for you and Franz to hit the guns; but then myself and Werner will find it more difficult to hit the flight line. If we go east-west, then we can bomb along the parked planes, destroying more of them; but that we'll increase your exposure to the flak guns."\n\nFranz nodded. "I think we should go east-west. If we don't destroy the flight line, we may have to go back there again. I'd rather be done with it now. If we fly fast enough, those flak gunners will have no chance."\n\nI could see that Erich didn't like the suggestion, but he remained silent. At least tactically, the plan seemed sound.\n\n
