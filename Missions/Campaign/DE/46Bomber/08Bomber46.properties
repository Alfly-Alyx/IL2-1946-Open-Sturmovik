Description The End.\n\nDate: June 22, 1946\n          1915\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Base: ---\nLocation: Memel\n\n\nI relaxed in an old chair outside the landing strip. The air smelled of jet fuel and meat stew. Our mechanics had just arrived, and they were finally giving our planes some long-needed maintenance. Other pilots were having dinner, but even though my stomach was growling, I did not feel like eating.\n\nA staff car drove by, returning my pilots back to their quarters. It screeched to a halt right after passing me, and reversed towards me.\n\n"Hey commander!" Somebody yelled. "You speak Russian, right?"\n\n"A little."\n\n"Come meet our friend."\n\nI walked towards the car, and suddenly stopped. My hand jerked towards my holster. A man was sitting inside, jammed between my guys, wearing a dirty khaki uniform. A Russian.\n\n"We've got ourselves a guest, Oberst. He don't talk much, but he sure can eat!"\n\nI was furious. After the losses our squadron has taken, after those bastards attacked us after pledging everlasting peace, these idiots were fraternizing with the enemy! I stepped forward and grabbed the grinning Ivan by the collar. His grin thinned, but he continued to look me straight in the eye.\n\n"You!" I said in Russian. "Which squadron are you from? Where's your base? What are your objectives?"\n\nThe Russian continued to look straight at me, as though deaf. I raised my hand to slap him, but something stopped me, and I turned around and began walking away.\n\n"Idiots!" I yelled. "Take your guest to HQ, and hand him over to the proper people."\n\nI went back to the chair, fuming, and sat down. It no longer seemed comfy. I tried to relax, but all the misfortunes of the day, and the Russian's grinning face kept bugging me. He knew they were winning, and so did I.\n\n"Herr Oberst? Phone call for you."\n\nMy heart sank even lower. I had no desire to speak to anyone at Luftflotte HQ. Those idiots would find something else to scream at me about.\n\n"Hallo?" I heard the familiar voice of Generalfeldmarschall Seidemann. \n\n"Generalfeldmarschall! I'm so glad to hear your voice..."\n\n"This is no time for pleasantries, Oberst. You are to take everyone, all planes and equipment, back to Koenigsberg immediately. There you will hand yourself over to the troops that are waiting for you. "\n\n"Sir?"\n\n"The Koenigsberg airfield has been carpet-bombed an hour ago, and most of your planes have been destroyed. I understand that you've never made arrangements to camouflage them for war time, and they remained lined up in parade rows all day. You are all that remains of KG 30."\n\nI felt weak, and began grasping for a chair. I couldn't reach one, so I just leaned against the table.\n\n"Moreover, Oberst, the reports of your squadron performance have been reviewed, and they are absolutely unsatisfactory. Bombing accuracy is ferocious, and results are virtually nil. I had to personally intervene, because Holle was ready to have you shot on the spot. You no longer have command of the squadron, and, frankly, I think you're out of the war. I wanted to call and tell you personally. I think, Festungshaft is... Oh, dear. I'm really beside myself. Just tell me, how could you have been so reckless? How... No matter. Oberst. Please get the remains of your squadron back to Koenigsberg safely."\n\n"Ja wohl, herr General. I will do so at once. Can we expect fighter cover?"\n\n"Ah, fighter cover? Yes, sure, of course. I'll have Holle arrange one for you. But don't wait for them. Begin preparations now."\n\n"Of course, sir."\n\nI hung up the phone and sat down on the floor. How could... This was... But... It took me several minutes to regain composure, and by the time I stood up, I knew I was not going to be arrested, I was not going through a trial. I took a deep breath, and everything became clear.\n\nI calmly told the mechanics to fill up all planes except mine, and headed towards the HQ building. The sentry at the door snapped at attention.\n\n"Is the Russian POW being held here?"\n\n"Yes sir, in the basement. He's awaiting transport to the rear."\n\n"Thank you."\n\nI headed in, and went straight to the basement. The POW was being questioned by a young leutnant. The Russki had a cigarette in his mouth, and looked smug and comfortable.\n\nI knocked the cigarette out of his lips with a well-placed punch, and before the pain in my knuckle registered, followed it up with a good uppercut. Ivan grunted and fell off the chair. The leutnant gasped.\n\nI yanked my pistol out of my holster and jammed it between the Ivan's teeth. \n\n"Where's your base? Who's your CO? Where's the headquarters of your air army?"\n\nThe Russian began shaking.\n\n"Leutnant!" I yelled in Russian. "Remove his shoes. We'll see how many of his toes we can shoot off before he begins talking."\n\n"Wait." the Russian said quietly. "Why all the fuss? I can tell you. The air army headquarters are at Schrunded airfield. It's the U-shaped building right next to the main tower. They're preparing a paradrop for later tonight. You can find lots of transport planes being prepared; but the flak is very heavy, and there are fighters everywhere."\n\nHe blinked and looked me in the eye. I looked away, took the pistol out of his mouth, and wiped the blood off the muzzle. I stood up and stumbled outside. My Arados were already lined up on the airstrip, and most of the squadron were in the cockpits, waiting for me to lead them back to Koenigsberg. They didn't know I'd be taking a detour.\n\n
