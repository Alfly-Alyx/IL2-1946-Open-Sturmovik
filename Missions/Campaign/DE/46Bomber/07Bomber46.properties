Description Wainoden.\n\nDate: June 22, 1946\n          1330\nWeather: Broken Clouds\nCloud Base: 800 m\nLocation: Memel\n\n\nI was dead tired. The mission to Libau was too hairy, and the experience of being shot at too unfamiliar. How easily I got used to peacetime... After returning I vented by calling somebody at Luftflotte HQ.\n\n"Ja, this is Geschwaderkommodore Schlammer of KG 30. Who am I speaking with?"\n\n"This is Oberst Dahlen, Chef des Stabes."\n\n"How did you get that job, Oberst? By licking lots of boots? Do you have any idea who to run the units under your command? Idiot! Have you ever heard of fighter escort?"\n\n"What?" The Oberst sounded indignant.\n\n"Who prepared this mission to Libau? My entire group was almost shot down over target. What, did the peacetime get to you? You forgot about the little issue of enemy fighters on the other side of the border? You..."\n\n"Enough! Listen up, Schlammer! Next time you need fighters, you ask for them. Understood? That's how we run things here, and that's how I ran them since the first war. And if you call me here again and speak in that tone of voice, you will be relieved of command immediately. I still need to speak with you about abandoning your assigned airfield at Koenigsberg. These things need to be cleared with me! Not that I'd ever give you permission for a stunt like that, but you call me first! Understood?"\n\nI was silent.\n\n"Stay by the telephone, Schlammer. You'll get your orders soon enough. Now I don't have time for you. I have to worry about the Ivan. Auf wiedersehen."\n\nHe hung up the phone, and I slammed down the receiver, nearly breaking it. I never wanted this damn command anyway. I would have been much happier being a simple pilot.\n\nThe orders came a little after lunch. The Russians made a breakthrough near the village of Wainoden, and were apparently digging in while waiting for reinforcements. Out troops regrouped outside the village and were initiating a quick counter-attack before the Ivans could catch their breath.\n\nI spent some time looking over the maps, and called my pilots in.\n\n"Listen up, everybody. We're going to this little border village called Wainoden. This time, we'll have fighter cover. Lead group of two planes will go first, search for any flak positions, and take them out of action. The main package will follow led by me. We'll fly very lose formation, separated by up to 1 km, to make detection and intercept by fighters less likely. My group's targets will be enemy tanks or artillery, whatever we find there, preferably whatever's clustered together. Good luck, friends."\n\n
