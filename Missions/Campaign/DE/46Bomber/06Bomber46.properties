Description Libau.\n\nDate: June 22, 1946\n          1015\nWeather: Broken Clouds\nCloud Base: 600 m\nLocation: Memel\n\n\nThe orders didn't take long to arrive. The new commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, and my old friend, again called me personally.\n\n"Good morning, commander. I can't say I quite agree with you abandoning your squadron behind, and rushing into the action."\n\n"My apologies General, but I stand by my decision. In the time it'd take us to fly to the frontline from Koenigsberg, I can fly three bombing missions from Memel. I can command the squadron perfectly well from here. And if the entire squadron is needed, the Memel group can join them on the way. I strongly believe that being close to my entire squadron is not as important as being close to the frontline..."\n\n"Fine, fine." Seidemann sighed. "I just fear that soon the front line may be close enough to Koenigsberg to warrant your return... For now, report to General Holle at Luftflotte 3. You'll get your future orders from him."\n\nHolle took over an hour to get in touch with, and by the time I got him on the phone he was furious. Apparently they've been trying to reach me at Koenigsberg at the same time.\n\n"Oberst! If you value your rank and your post, you will immediately proceed to Libau! Soviet navy is harassing our shipping, and their presence near the Prussian coast is extremely heavy. Libau is one of their main bases. Attack it immediately. You hear me? Immediately, Oberst! That means  now!"\n\nI hung up the phone and went to the briefing room. The excitement of battle quickly drowned out the anger I felt after being screamed at. We've practiced for this kind of attack for almost two years, and everyone had their role perfectly memorized. Two planes would fly ahead, get the attention of flak guns, and hit them. I'd follow with the main package, and dive bomb the ships. \n\n
