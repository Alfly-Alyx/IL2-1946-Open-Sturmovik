Description The Fuhrer's Death.\n\nDate: July 20, 1944\n          1247\nWeather: Broken Clouds\nCloud Base: 1,500 m\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\n\nIt was Thursday. The rebellion was scheduled for today. Last night I gave everyone extended weekend leave, except for Werner Haller, Franz Kirschner and Erich Brandt, my three co-conspirators. Since 5 am we sat around the telephone, waiting for the call, waiting for our orders. Our four Arados stood next to the runway, bombs strapped to them, supposedly ready for another trip to the bombing range.\n\nThe phone rang at 12:42. \n\n"Hallo? Hauptmann Schlammer here."\n\n"This is General Fellgiebel speaking. Are you the commander of the Arado Blitz group?"\n\n"Yes, herr General."\n\n"How many planes are ready?"\n\n"Four, sir."\n\n"Are you capable of a precision strike?"\n\n"We can dive bomb."\n\n"Good. Send two of your best dive bomber pilots to Postdam. Their target is the Reichsfurer. He's visiting the SS Potsdam headquarters in the main square, across from the railway station. Proceed immediately at top speed. We cannot afford to let Himmler leave the building and hide."\n\n"Only two planes, sir? With four..."\n\n"Postdam is a fair distance away. We may need more strikes before you return from this mission."\n\n"Understood, sir. We're on our way... But before we go, can you tell us? Is... Is the Fuhrer..."\n\n"Dead. Now, don't waste any more time. Good luck."\n\nI placed the receiver carefully back on the hook and sat down. My legs felt like I was on stilts. \n\n"What is it?" Werner asked.\n\nBefore I could answer, the loudspeakers outside began blaring. \n\n"Achtung! Ahctung! This is General Ludwig Beck speaking. Attention all German troops. The Fuhrer is dead. I repeat, Adolf Hitler is dead. I have been temporarily appointed head of state. All armed forces of Germany are currently under my control. Our main priority is to maintain peace and order in the towns and cities of Germany. I am therefore activating Operation Walkuere. The Reserve Army is mobilized effective immediately. They are to take full control of all aspects of government. Anyone resisting the Reserve Army is to be treated as an enemy of the state and dealt with according to martial law. There will be more detailed broadcasts in the coming hours. Long live Germany!"\n\nWe were already outside, getting into our Kuebelwagen. I signaled to the mechanics to start preparing our Arados for take-off.\n\n"My dear Germans!" a familiar voice began booming from the radio. "This is Reichsmarshall Goering. I have just heard the saddest news, and can confirm that our beloved Fuhrer has indeed perished at Wolfschanze in a bombing raid. General Beck and Dr Goerdeler are assuming temporary control of the Reich. In my capacity as the commander of the Luftwaffe I order all airmen to remain on the ground..."\n\nWe were already getting into our cockpits.\n\n"Sir?" Hans-Ullrich, my mechanic, looked scared. "Shouldn't you abort..."\n\n"I have direct orders from the new government. Please stand back."\n\nHans-Ullrich backed away slowly. The radio began to hiss.\n\n"Achtung! This is General von St\u00FClpnagel, the commander of the German armed forces in France. With the changed situation in Germany, I am moved to request an immediate cease-fire on the Western Front. All armed forces of the United States and Great Britain are asked to..."\n\nI put my flying helmet on and the external noise disappeared. The headphones crackled.\n\n"The thing's really moving ahead, isn't it?" Werner sounded tense. "Where are we going?"\n\n"Potsdam. SS headquarters. Our mark is Himmler himself. Just stay on my tail, and don't miss. Let's go!"\n\n
