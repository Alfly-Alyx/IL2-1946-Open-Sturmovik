I was now an Oberst, a famous hero of the new Germany. My country was once again ruled by a Kaiser. The world was at peace. There was a lot of rebuilding to be done, but neither us nor the Russians were disbanding our armies. My new squadron, KG 3, reformed around me and other July 20th veterans, continued training as if during wartime. Jets no longer seemed new or exciting. Our own Arado Blitz, two years ago a wonder machine, didn't even seem all that fast next to the new generations of fighters serving alongside us - and on the other side of the fence.\n\nBy early June of 1946 it was becoming obvious that the Russians were up to something. Training intensified, and many of the units were moved closer to the German-Soviet border. Two days ago, on June 20st, KG 3 was moved to a base near Koenigsberg, as close to the Soviet-occupied Latvia as we could comfortably get. There were many other airstrips in Lithuania, but none of them were repaved since we were received control of the country two years ago, and our bombers needed a hard, flat, smooth runway to operate.\n\nI was awakened at 4 in the morning on the 22nd of June. Willi, my adjutant, was pale as a ghost.\n\n"Herr Oberst! There's a phone call for you."\n\n"Yes. Thank you Willi. Ah, bring me my boots..."\n\n"Sir! I think it's war. I can hear artillery to the North!"\n\nI rubbed my eyes and began to listen. Indeed, very faintly in the distance, I could hear a rumble. All sleep immediately evaporated and I ran towards my office barefoot.\n\n"Hallo? Hallo?" somebody's voice was yelling in the receiver.\n\n"Ja, Oberst Schlammer here."\n\n"Morning, Oberst. This is Generalfeldmarschall Seidemann. Ready your squadron. The Russians attacked us all along the border. We're unprepared, but we must stop their offensive at all costs! Detailed orders to follow."\n\nI sounded the air raid siren and began to think. We were too far from the border, and we were the closest bombers to it. If we wanted to provide any kind of a decent support, we needed to be closer. If a pilot was experienced enough, and if the runway long and wide, we didn't need concrete. I didn't even need to look at the personnel file. By the time the squadron was lined up outside my office, I knew exactly who I would be taking up with me.\n\nWe took off at dawn and flew towards Memel. Our planes were fully fueled and carried heavy bombs. Our mechanics wouldn't arrive at Memel for many hours, and this way we'd be ready for a sortie without them.\n\n
