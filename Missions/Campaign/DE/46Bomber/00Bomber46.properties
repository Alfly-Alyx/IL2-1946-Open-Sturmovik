Description The Plot\n\nDate: July 17, 1944\n          1816\nWeather: Poor\nCloud Base: 1,400 m\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\nAs the Gruppenkommandeure I had my own train compartment. I could hear bursts of laughter and loud talking through the walls, but the sheets were clean and the pillow was soft, and those sounds could be tuned out even easier than the rumble of artillery and roar of engines that accompanied my sleep for the past five years.\n\nMy pilots must have been very confused. We had just arrived at Sch\u00F6nfeld-Seifersdorf in Poland three weeks ago to convert to the new Ar-234 jet bomber. Most of the guys didn't even get to fly the Blitz, and suddenly all of them were loaded onto trains and ordered to Berlin. No one understood why they were needed at the capital. The Allied landing in Normandy failed a month ago. Everyone wondered whether another one was expected, or if the situation was so bad that a Russian breakthrough could reach Berlin itself. All of those crated Ar-234s we were taking with us mystified the squadron even more. \n\nI needed to speak to a few of my friends and explain the situation to them. The time was running out, but I couldn't get myself to get up. \n\nSomebody knocked on the door.\n\n"Yes? Come in."\n\nThe door slid open, and Werner Haller walked in. He looked slightly drunk, and his usually rosy cheeks we full-on blushing.\n\n"Ah, just the man I was thinking of. Please have a seat."\n\nWerner nodded, and sat on the bed bunk opposite mine. He looked criminally messy, and any other day I would scream at him to button his shirt and to fix his hair, but today none of that mattered.\n\n"Enough of this drinking!" Werner grinned. "Figured I'd come talk to you. Would you please enlighten me and explain this unexpected leave? What's going on?"\n\nI barely heard him speak. My own thoughts kept twisting in my head, and it took me a while to realize that the room grew silent, and Werner was beginning to look confused waiting for my answer. I took a deep breath.\n\n"Werner. You're one of the few people I can trust, and so I hope you'll treat everything said between us as highly confidential."\n\nHe blinked.\n\n"What would you say if I told you there was a movement of high-ranking German officers designed to replace German leadership, and to end this war?"\n\nWerner's mouth flew open, and for a moment it looked like his eyes would pop out of his head. \n\n"A conspiracy?" Werner said slowly. "I would say, herr Hauptman, that the traitors all need to be swiped up and shot... And if I could personally..."\n\n"That's not what I mean."\n\nWerner's mouth opened again, but no sound came out. Realization began to dawn in his eyes.\n\n"Werner. We've been friends for a long time. We served together for four years. I know how you feel about this war. I know that you're a patriot. I know you want the best for your country. Germany is heading for a catastrophe. We are fighting a war that cannot be won, and the main reason is not our army, but our leadership. The Russians can be beaten, but our commander in chief is running the war into the ground. If he is removed, we can hope to plead for peace with the Western Allies; then use the western front troops to reach an impasse on the Russian Front, and conclude a favorable peace with the Soviets."\n\n"This is a plot against... the Fuhrer? You're blaming everything on... Hitler?"\n\nWerner looked so shocked, and pronounced Hitler's name with such reverence, that I knew this entire thing was a mistake. I was finished. I exhaled and wiped the sweat off my forehead. \n\n"Werner. You cannot be that blind. He's the commander in chief. He makes all the decisions. Remember Stalingrad? Hitler's a madman, a corporal running an army. Of course he's losing the war for us. Our squadron was sent to Fuerstenwalde because once he's removed, we will need all the troops we can get to help the rebellion take hold. At least the SS is sure to refuse to accept our orders."\n\n"I... I swore an oath. This... You're asking too much of me."\n\nThe stubble on my face was beginning to itch. I looked away, and closed my eyes.\n\n"I don't ask for your answer now. We're on this train until tomorrow. Please think this over; make a decision in the morning. And please don't let my trust in you be misplaced. I know you'll see the right thing to do. And if you won't..." I patted the leather holster on my hip. "I won't let them arrest me. My death wouldn't change the inevitable... Now, good night." \n\nI got up, saluted and pushed the door open. \n\nWerner stood up, dazed, and stumbled out of the room. I half-expected the door to fly open, and a bunch of soldiers to rush in and arrest me. But I could hear nothing unusual outside. I laid back in my bunk, and shut my eyes.\n\nThe train came to a stop so suddenly that I almost fell off the bunk. Damn, why didn't anyone wake me up? Were we here already? I grabbed my shaving utensils and started whipping up the lather. The door into my compartment slid open just as I began applying it to my face.\n\n"What about the rest of the squadron?" Werner stood in the entrance, holding the door open.\n\n"I don't know. We'll have to convince the people we trust. As for the others..."\n\nWerner slammed the door shut.\n\nI spent the rest of the trip in a daze. Quarters were already prepared for me at Fuerstenwalde. I shook hands with a lot of officers, and then got away and asked for a bomber and the route to the bombing range. I needed to be alone with my thoughts.\n\n
