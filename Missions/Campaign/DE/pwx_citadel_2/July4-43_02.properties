Description ###############################\ndate : 04 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 11:00\nweater : Hazy\n###############################\n\nOkay Gentlemen,\n\nI hope you have found the previous mission of some good use because I have received orders from Major Leie.\n\nRecon has learned us that the enemy is flying many defensive missions above Ponyri. \nWhen the enemy would do this above their bases near Stalingrad this would be normal. But Ponyri? What's there? As far as I know nothing of essence to the Russians. \n\nOr do they have something there.\n\nI want you guys to fly a patrol above Ponyri and find out.\nIts a fighter - sweep , recon mission so you are free to go after enemy fighters.\n\n.. Sebastian : Sir, but I assume we can only do that after we have reached target right?\n\nIf you mean going after enemy fighters, yes.\n\nOkay any questions?\n\n..Rainer : , well not to major importance to us right now but still I am curious. When is the big offensive planned to take off?\n\nWell, I cannot say anything to you about that right now. I do have some dates. Except for the fact that I am not allowed to tell you when it will happen. I don't even know for a hundred percent sure if these dates are correct.\n\nWell any questions on topic?\n\nNo?!\n\nDismissed.\n
