Description ###############################\ndate : 04 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 15:25\nweater : Blind\n###############################\n\nTwo Ju-52's are heading this way. They are stuffed up with fresh troops for the front.\n\nNow fifteen minutes a go they were attacked by a LaGG fighter. They managed to score several hits on it and it broke off.\n\nHowever the aircraft stayed near for at least five minutes after that it moved away probably back home.\n\nSpotters on the ground report a group of at least four enemy aircraft heading in the direction of our Ju-52's.\n\nSo our soviet friend allerted his family.\n\nNow take off asap and escort Tante Ju to base.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNo questions?\n\n..Sebastian : what direction?\n\nYou are paying no attention as usual. See the paper I gave you.\n\n..Sebastian : Whoops, by the way sir, looking up at the sky. The clouds are that dense the Ju's can easily hide in there.\nSo actually no reason for us to set out.\n\nIf they get killed you will hang!\n\nThe answer is no!, I won't take the risc.\n\n\n
