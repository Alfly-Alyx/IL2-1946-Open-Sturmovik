Description ###############################\ndate : 12 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 08:00\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nWaky waky!!!\n\nA day full of action lies ahead!!\nDuring the entire night the Soviets have been attacking our forces located in Shlisselburg.\n\nWe need to hold this town.\n\nTherefore your A4's have been equipped with bomb racks and SC 500 bombs.\n\nYour task will be to destroy the enemy artillery positions near im. Morozova.\nExpected enemy oppostion is light.\n\n... : Why do you expect it to be light sir? Yesterday it was pretty heavy to my opinion.\n\nIt was heavy yesterday and it will be today but as I expect the Luftwaffe to open the day in regard to air combat I assume not many Communist fighters have taken off yet.\n\n... : Ah in that manner. What exactly makes Shlisselburg that important to us?\n\nWell it is important in two ways. It is a large harbour so the occupieing force can use it to bring in new supplies.\n\nSecond, Shlisselburg is the last facet remaining blocking the Soviets from accessing the Soviet besieged forces in Leningrad. If they can reach them it will be impossible to keep on the Siege.\n\nDo you understand your task?\n\n... : Yes sir!!!\n
