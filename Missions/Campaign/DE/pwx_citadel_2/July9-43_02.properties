Description ###############################\ndate : 09 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 11:20\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nFatezh has been reached.\n\nWe have taken only minor losses.\n\nAs I speak to commanders in the field it looks like the new PanzerKampfwagen VI is of incredible value in the field.\n\nIt's mighty 88 gun takes out about any tank the Soviet enemy can bring forward from more than one Kilometre away.\n\nThat's way out of reach of the Soviet guns.\n\nThe Soviet T-34 has to come close as even a hundred meter to be sure to do any serious damage.\n\nWhile 1,5 Kilometres is more than close enough to take it out with a Tiger.\n\n... Sebastian : That's good to hear sir. But we are airman not tankers.\n\nThat's true.\n\n... K\u00FCrt : unfortunately we still don't have that invincible airplane.\n\nMaybe it will come. Several new types of aircraft are under developement.\n\nBut like I said the Soviets have dug in themselves in Fatezh. \n\nA group of Schlachtflieger will go in to raid the village.\n\nOur Panzers are encircling the village at the same time.\n\nYou know what to do.\n\nGet them safely back home.\n
