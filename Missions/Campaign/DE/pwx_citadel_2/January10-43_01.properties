Happy I am rid of this job. Some gotta love it some gotta hate it. Though I am curious what my new Staffel will look like. And what plane I will fly.\n\nK\u00F6nig said something about a FW-190. Looking forward to fly that crate. It is claimed it has huge firepower. Though others told me that my new JG is also flying older G2's so I don't know what plane I will fly.\n\nLooking at the seemingly endless landscape covered with snow it pleases me that I will be home again this summer. At least if the Fuhrer is right. He told that there was something big to happen very soon that would ensure total German victory.\n\nWe do have the Japanese empire at our side but  I don't see anything of it. Of course I do not expect Japanese planes to fly along side but I do not see the enemy scattering and getting weaker by the minute.\n\nWell lets hope that will change.*\n
