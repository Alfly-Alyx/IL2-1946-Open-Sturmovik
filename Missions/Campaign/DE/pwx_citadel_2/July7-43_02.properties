Description ###############################\ndate : 07 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 08:00\nweather : Average\n###############################\n\nWelcome back at base.\n\nWe haven't send in a spotter yet to confirm the effect of last mission.\n\nRight now I have received orders to patrol the Livny area.\nI know it is pretty far from here. It is a mistery to me why you should patrol it.\n\nBut it is an order. And an order is an order. Except if it is not humane but that's just me.\nThat's not an issue right now.\n\nA flight of 109's will join you.\n\nIf everything is correct I will recieve another reeinforcement for our staffel this afternoon.\n\nAlso some other news I have got for you.\nWe will move to another base located closer to the front this evening.\n\nThis in regard to be closer to the action and be at the place of action in less time.\n\nOkay I hear some aircraft engines that sound like German to me. Now go!!!\nCatch that flight.\n
