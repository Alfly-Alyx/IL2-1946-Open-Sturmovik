Description ###############################\ndate : 05 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 20:30\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nWe are going to move. Just had a call with high command and I am authorize to fly our staffel to the airfield above Orel.\n\nIt is not that far from here but it should definetly give us some more cover then this airfield does.\n\nIts main disadvantage however is that this airfield is closer to the front and therefore we are able to support our ground troops more directly and quicker.\n\nThat advantage is now gone.\n\nAnyway a reasonable use of this airfield is gone too.\n\nSo right now what we can do is ready yourself for a flight towards your  new airfield.\n\nIn the meantime I want four fighters to patroll our front and the airspace enemy bombers have to cross when they would attack our airfield.\n\nBy the way, Sebastian, I got you a new aircraft.\nYou crashed your last one and this is all we got right now.\n\nIt is composed out of spare parts. Yes I know you are amazed but we have them.\n\n,,, Sebastian : True, the Wermacht boys are really begging for spare parts. But they don't get any. \n,,, Sebastian :  Disabled tanks have to be send back all the way to Germany for repair.\n\n,,, Sebastian : Instead of fixing their tanks on the front they have to wait until new tanks arrive.\n\nYeah I know, our Fuhrer loves numbers. The more new tanks that go to the front the better. He doesn't pay any attention to the actual number of available tanks at the front. Don't even think of the servicable tanks.\n\n... Rainer : So it is a miracle we even have spare parts?\n\nYes.\n\nSebastian, your aircraft is composed out of spare parts and elements from another aircraft you crashed during landing a couple of days a go.\n\nIt looks strange but it should be airworthy.\n\nLarge parts of your new aircraft aren't even painted but it should work great.\n\n,,, Sebastian : Hehe, well I should do with it isn't it?\n\nYes.\n\n,,, Sebastian : Besides, now I am unique.\n\nTrue, but cut the crap and board your kite for another routine patrol.\n\nHave a nice flight.\n\n... : Thanks, see you within an hour.\n\nI hope.\n
