Description ###############################\ndate : 06 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 21:00\nweather : Average\n###############################\n\nGot some good news and some bad news.\n\nWich first.\n\n... : Bad news, it can only get better then.\n\n... Rainer : Nah, good news.\n\n... Sebastian : just tell who cares the order.\n\nOkay, first, we gained some terrain and our forces will soon take Ponyri. \nThe bad news is you are asked for another escort mission again.\n\n... : Well if it is another zero contact mission like the last one I am fine with it.\n\n... : A month a go I would have said please give me some action. But now I have seen enough and I am dieing to see my bunkbed again.\n\nYou will see soon enough.\n\n... Sebastian : Why us and not the nightfighter squadrons?\n\nThey are assigned to other tasks right now and as our airforce is slowly scattering over the front we should use all we have.\n\nIts another raid on the pocket again.\n\nThe resistance is fading slowly but we want to perform another raid in an attempt to let them surrender on their own initiative. So we will not have to take any more casulties.\n\nThe bombers are already on their way and should soon reach the meeting point. \n\nFrom there on you should escort them over target.\n\nThen after Zmievka you loose formation again and head back home.\n
