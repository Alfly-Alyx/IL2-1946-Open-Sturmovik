Description ###############################\ndate : 11 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 09:00\nweater : Hazy\n###############################\n\nGoodmorning Lads!!\n\nHope you enjoyed your flight.\nWelcome at your new base.\n\n... : Thank you. It is quite big. And bigger then the based I have served from.\n\nAh well everything has  to be experienced once isn't it?\n\n... : Yeah sure!\n\nCome on a bit more optimism is required here.\n\nLets tell a  bit about our base. You are near Siverskaya a new pilot of the JG 54 Stab I.\n\nA cold base close to Stalingrad. And I underline cold because if you thought you knew what having cold feet meant you're wrong!!\n\nI heard you have some flying experience in the FW-190 or have you flown just the Ju-88?\n\n... : No sir!\n... : When I got back to Germany in August last year I was called to officers mess and I was told that I would be trained to fly fighters and the same day I would start taining. Initially I learned to fly the Me 109E and in November last year I flew a Focke Wulf 190A1.\n\nAh one of the older 190's. \nSo you have some experience in it?\n\n... : I think so sir?\n\nDo you think you would sill need some more flying hours to start flying in it for real?\n\nBecause we can use fresh pilots here. But dead fresh pilots are useless. So if you're of opinion you could use some more flying hours without flying actual combat missions just say so. No big deal.\n\n(* What does that guy think?? Man it wasn't the Soviets that nearly killed me. It was my superiors that nearly bored me to death having me to fly just cargo missions in a Ju-88!! That was designed to be a dive bomber. Well I can tell you I haven't flow a single bombing mission in my life!! *)\n\n.... : No sir!! I think I can handle it.\n\nOkay that's nice!\nYou sound quite convinced and that's promising.\n\nLive after that expectaion I have from you.\n\n... : I will try to sir.\n\nOkay, I read on your file you are reccomended to be the flight leader as you seem to be very skilled and a tallented pilot.\n\nIs that correct?\n\n... : Of course sir the best you can have.\n\nYou know you are stretching my expectations do you?\n\n... : Eehr, oops!\n\nGood choice of words.\n\nWell lets go to business.\n\nWithin ten minutes you will have your first flight at the eastern front.\n\n... : Have been there before sir. Last year I flew near Stalingrad and Smolensk.\n\nOkay, well at the Norhern front then.\n\nIt will be a zero contact mission at least probably just to familliarize yourself a bit with the environment. And in case you get off mission and you need to find your way back home without a map.\n\nI have written your flight path on the map I will hand you before you leave.\n\nAny questions?\n\nNo?\n\nOkay enjoy your flight.\n\n
