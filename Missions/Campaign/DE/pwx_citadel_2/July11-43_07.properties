Description ###############################\ndate : 11 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 16:15\nweather : Rain and Thunder\n###############################\n\n... Kurt: There's a positive side on this weather sir.\n\n(* Kurt stands for the window, while the lightning flash lites his face like it is white as milk. But only for a second. He makes a bit of a move like he was scared by the flash. *)\n\nWhy do you think that Kurt?\n\n... Kurt: Well, we cannot fly in this weather. At least it is far from safe.\n\n... Kurt: And as the Soviet planes work no different from ours they probably won't fly too.\n\nI would not bet on that Kurt, the Russians have taken risks like that before. I have seen captured Soviet pilots standing in front of me. DRUNK!!\n\nI have once even seen a Soviet IL2 crashing in a lake. Well crash landing. Near the Shore though.\n\nI stood near as some soldier noticed movements in the plane. We ran towards the Soviet wreck. Although wreck. Its prop was molested but the plane was mostly in-tact.\n\nWe could not open the canopy the regular way so one of the soldiers started bashing against the canopy with his Mauser Karabine 98.\n\n... Sebastian: With the muzzle sir?\n\nOf course not you idiot. With the butt-plate!!\nWe managed to get the pilot and the gunner out alive and without a scratch. However they were as drunk as a fish that swam in alcohol.\n\nNo wonder the Soviets sometimes don't know any fear.\n\n(* The radio scratches!!!, The Hauptmann walks towards the wireless and ... *)\n\nGentlemen, bad news,,\n\nUnlike Kurt said we still have to fly.\nHeavy Soviet tank formations are breaking through South -  East from Fatezh.\n\nWe will send in a group of Ju-87G1 tank busters to support our ground troops.\n\nThey require escorts.\n\nYou are the chosen ones.\n\n... Sebastian: As usual!!\n... Sebastian: Don't forget I am about to marry sir!! I want to get through the war alive!\n\nEveryone wants that.\n\nNow GO!!\n
