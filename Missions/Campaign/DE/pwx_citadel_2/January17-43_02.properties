Description ###############################\ndate : 17 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 09:35\nweather : Snow\n###############################\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI have just received an urgent message from high command.\nThey intercepted a radio message from our communist friends that they will raid our supply depot in Krasnoe Selo.\n\nIt is near the frontline and it was already planned to be evactuated soon.\n\nBut the Soviets were on the initiative.\n\nWe are not a 100% sure about the reliabillity of this information so therefore we only send in eight fighters. This should be enough to repel a small scale raid.\n\nHowever when you are airborne you can request for back-up anytime.\n\nAny questions?\n\n... : Flight altitude?\n\nApprox 2500 Metres.\n\nGood luck\n
