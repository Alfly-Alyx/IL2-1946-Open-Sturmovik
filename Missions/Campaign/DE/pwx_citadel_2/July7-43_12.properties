Sebastian : WOW!!! staggering!!!\n\n... Rainer : When hearing that I would almost think we already won the war.\n\nFar from it.\n\nWe are facing ever growing numbers. 9 to 1 at some places.\n\nSame for our Panzers. They do great but the number of enemy tanks is just too sheer.\n\nLook at the terrain we gained.\nIt is only very little in comparison to the effort we have put into.\n\nIt is almost like someone is setting us up.\n\n... : What do you mean with that sir?\n\nWell like the Soviets know our orders given earlier than we do.\nI mean like someone is spying on us.\n\n... : Could be, but who?\n\n(* Rainer is mumbling something about Lucy spy ring etc etc... *)\n\nWhat about Lucy, Rainer?\n\n... Rainer : Well I heard a lot about it but they cannot track him nor get any clues of his contacts. It is starting to annoy me a lot.\n\nYeah, they should catch the d*** bastard. He is killing many of his own men with his ridiculous actions.\n\nBut okay you guys are ordered to patrol the Ponyri area in an attempt to stop any enemy fighter or bomber to reach our positions.\nWe already intercepted some recon crates and this suggest that the enemy will try to attack our positions soon.\n\nAny questions?\n\n... : About that Lucy ring what is it exactly?\n\nNot to business during this mission. Back on topic please.\n\n... Rainer : No further questions.\n\nOkay go then!\n\n###############################\nHistorical background :\n\nThe Lucy Spy ring was a spy group against Germany.\nLead by a German refugee who had high placed friends in the German military command. They were of opinion that Germany was doomed by the Nazi regime and the only possibility to save Germany was to be conquered by the Communist. Therefore he set up a spy ring with a radio station in Switzerland sending continues information about German orders to Soviet high command.\n\nThe radio station was raided by the Swiss police in 1944 and the leading person was arrested. The Spy ring stopped.\n\n
