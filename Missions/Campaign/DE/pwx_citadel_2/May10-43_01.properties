Sebastian : Since last month.\n\nAaah, so you still have well over eight months to return to withness the birth of your son!!\n\n... Sebastian : Yes I do.\n\n... Rainer : Congratulations. Nice to hear that. And when will you be getting married?\n\n... Sebastian : As soon as I get back from the front.\n\n... Rainer : Congratulations m8! and a father and a groom!\n\nCongrats buddy!\n\n... : Congratulations, your Staffel is proud with you.\n\n... Sebastian : Thanks guys.\n\nOkay let's get back to the order of the day.\n\nYour Staffel has been equipped with the new FW-190A6.\nIt is basically an upgraded Focke Wulf A5.\n\nBut it has improved armour protection. A stronger yet lighter wing construction.\nTwo MG-17 machine guns and four MG-151 cannons.\n\n... Sebastian : Why still the MG-17's? I mean why didn't they upgrade those?\n\nBecause of the tracer rounds this gun can fire.\n\n... Rainer : What armour exactly has been increased?\n\nMostly canopy armour plates are added.\n\nAlso the new FuG 16ZE radio navigation system has been installed.\nThis radio system allows you to track enemy targets and send and receive radio messages at the same time.\n\nIts engine the BMW 801D-2 can bring up about 1800Hp.\n\n... : Impressive but still it looks like an almost equal version of the FW-190A5.\n\nAnyway the aircraft are standing outside ready for their first flight.\nStill in factory paint colors but that doesn't matter right now.\n\nI want you guys to take it for a little flight to get used to this kite.\n\nGood luck!\n
