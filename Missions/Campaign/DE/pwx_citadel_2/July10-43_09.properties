Description ###############################\ndate : 10 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 17:24\nweather : Poor\n###############################\n\nBad news gentlemen,\n\nI just received news from the Italian front.\n\n... Sebastian: Italian front?, is there any?\n\nNow there is. Last night British and US troops performed airborne landings on Sicily.\nThe airborne attacks were however rather fruitless for our opponents as they were facing strong wind scattering the paratroopers and gliders all over the island and some even landed in the sea.\n\nNevertheles lateron that morning sea landings were carried out. Due to low morale and poor training and lack of aquadate equipment our Italian allies did nearly nothing to oppose them.\n\nThe Luftwaffe is desperatly attempting to drive out the invadors but their number is just too large.\n\nThis is also adding to the bad mood of the Fuhrer that is considering the offensive on the eastern front as you are taking part of as a failed offensive.\n\nVon Manstein is trying to convince our Fuhrer we must go on but he seems to have given up all hope.\n\n... Sebastian: Do you mean he wants to call off the offensive?\n\nYes.\n\n... Sebastian: That's ridiculous!! All this effort, all those men!! For nothing??\n\nIn the end? Yes.\n\n... Sebastian: How insane!, The Soviets can recover their losses we cannot. So we have to achieve our goals in effort to not letting this offensive to become our doom!\n\nI think you are right but I have nothing to say in regard to that.\n\nBut it seems there is a big chance we will be withdrawn from the front.\n\n... Rainer: And then?\n\nWe will probaly fight Amis on the Southern front.\n\n... Sebastian: This is going wrong!!\n\nYes it is.\n\nBut for now I want you to head towards Maloarkhangelsk and return back base.\n\nAs a patrol.\n\nMost likely you will encounter enemy aircraft as the enemy air presence is high.\n\nGood luck.\n
