Description ###############################\ndate : 06 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 08:30\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\n(* One hour later at the base you are called to the mess for a briefing. : Now what? I and the rest of course have been on tour almost non stop since July 3rd . Had some hasty sleep last night although it was the first time in one week that I can say I really slept and I am fit again.  Hmmzzz, seeing the clouds comming from the repair workshop and our 190's in front of it says enought. Our krates are having a paint job. They needed it though. Eehr, aren't those our lend krates? With gun boats on it? that is not promising any good.\n( At that moment Mr Kiefer walks in. ) A mister Kiefer again. What's on his mind I wonder. *)\n\nGENTLEMEN!!\n\nListen up!!\n\nJust ten minutes a go our boys in the field spotted a large flight of Soviet transports above Novosil and three minutes later another unit spotted spotted the same flight again still heading in the same direction.\n\nThe flight is as far as we can see unescorted. In other words your next task will be a milk run.\n\nYour aircraft have been armed with 20MM Gun boats as you might have noticed. \n\nYour flight will head to Zmievka and and from there on you will head to Arkhangelskoe to face our Soviet friends.\n\nYou have no questions as I have been clear.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(* Hmmzz, how polite. Deciding for us what we think. I think I am starting to dislike some of the Ubermenschen!! Especially those with a small mustache. *)\n
