Description ###############################\ndate : 06 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 13:40\nweather : Average\n###############################\n\nGood to see you.\n\n... : I wish I could say the same.\n\n(* Rainer pokes you in the side *)\n\n... Rainer :  shhhhhhhhhhh!!!!\n\nWhat did you say?\n\n... : Nothing nothing.... just having some thea and relaxing a bit after flight.\n\nNo time to relax here.\n\nRelaxing and sleeping is something you do in Germany.\n\n... Sebastian : And all places available for that purpose such as your cockpit.\n\n...  Rainer : Hehehe.\n\n... Sebastain : By the way, what's the status of our own aircraft.\n\n... Rainer : Yeah, because I am dieing to have my MW50 back.\n\nDon't die, that won't speed up the process.\n\n... Rainer : By the matter of speaking.\n\nI think your crates are done this evening.\n\nFor now you are going to fly your A4's for a couple of more missions.\n\n... : Okay, speak up what's our next goal.\n\nWell, we have a large formation of Panzers a couple Kilometres South of Tagino.\n\nThey already endured several air raids.\n\nBut we expect some more IL2's to close in to deliver their deadly package soon.\n\nSo to prevent this you must patroll the area.\n\nAny questions?\n\n... : Expected opposition?\n\nDon't really know. Most likely IL2's but about enemy fighters I don't know.\n\nYou could encounter a whole squadron.\n\nBut also just two.\n\nJust hope for the best and if things really get worse request back-up.\n\n\n
