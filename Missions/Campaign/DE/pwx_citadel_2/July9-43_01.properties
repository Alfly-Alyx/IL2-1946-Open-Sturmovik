But I mean I would prefer zero losses.\n\nYes definetly.\n\nBut that ain't my choice.\n\nThe fighting has reopened and the Tigers are rolling further into enemy territory.\n\n... Rainer : That's impressive talk but they gained only a few kilometres.\n\nDon't interrupt me like that.\n\nYou are about to escort a group of Ju-87 G-1's and Hs-129's towards target near Fatezh.\n\nMake sure they all return in one piece.\n\nYou will most likely encounter plenty of enemy ground attack aircraft.\nIf possible try to destroy as many as possible before they start their run.\n
