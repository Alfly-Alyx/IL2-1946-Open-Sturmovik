Description ###############################\ndate : 09 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 16:22\nweather : Hazy\n###############################\n\nWelcome back at base,\n\nBTW, Sebastian, your windscreen has been repaired, and Rainer yours has been replaced.\n\n... Sebastian : Thank you sir, but the damage was quite severe. Wouldn't it have been better to replace the thing too?\n\nNo, not at all. Only your frond screen has been replaced. The other was just a scratch. It has been polished and now you only see a tine small wite line. But it isn't such a big deal.\n\n...  Kurt : Sir, my aiming device?\n\nHas been fixed, its light was dead. It works again.\n\n... Rainer : Don't want to interrupt but we are here for a reason. What's it?\n\nAh, yes indeed.\n\nOur armour continued their march South of Fatezh.\nThey have run into a huge enmy mechanized unit.\nSo a very, but very large and heavy battle is taking place right now.\n\nWe expect the enmy will try to raid our forces from the air so I want you to go in for top cover.\n\nAny questions?\n
