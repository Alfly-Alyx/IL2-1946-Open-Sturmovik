Description ###############################\ndate : 12 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 14:45\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nSo far so good.\nOur forces have been sucessfully evacuated.\n\nThis is a real bummer by the way. The ring has been broken for the first time since two years.\nSo Lenindrad is no longer besieged.\n\nHitler however promised many new tanks and also new Schwere Panzer abteilungen to arrive at the front thus giving us a numerical and also technical advantage over the communist enemy.\n\n... Sebastian : Hehehe!!! Yeah!! sure!! of course and according the Fuhrer we have won the war two weeks a go.\n\n..... No comments on that but shut up!\n\nHeavy frontline fighting is taking place and slowly our forces have to give away metres of terrain.\n\nWe have been ordered to patrol the perimeter in an effort to stop or at least slow down Soviet air operations.\n
