Sebastian : Ohw well back to usual. So average.\n\nWell as long as you keep your aggressiveness in the air I have no problems with it.\n\nAlright. as you know the Soviets are increasing in strength the last couple of weeks.\n\nAnd we are now loosing ground fast.\nTherefore our forces are trying to build up a new line at the height of Gorelovo.\n\nThis has not gone unnoticed by the enemy as well. They are almost continuously trying to destroy our forces from the air.\n\nSometimes just a lone Sturmovik waggles but other times as this occasion you will have to intercept a larger group of IL2's attacking our artillery positions.\n
