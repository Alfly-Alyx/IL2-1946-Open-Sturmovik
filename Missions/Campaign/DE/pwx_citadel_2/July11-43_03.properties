Description ###############################\ndate : 11 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 11:00\nweather : Poor\n###############################\n\nThe rain has stopped.\n\nI guess its just for a moment because it is like that all the time.\n\n... Kurt: I am afraid I don't quite get what you mean sir.\n\nI mean the weather, one moment it is raining cats and dogs. And the other it is dry again.\n\nTerrible weather for flying though.\n\nOkay, does anyone remember Arkhangelskoe?\nSure you should.\n\nWe have advanced only till Turovka but we have been forced to halt and our forces have dug in.\n\nAt the moment of speaking the Soviets have launched a massive armoured offensive in the area of Arkhangelskoe.\n\nWe have not yet send in any Jabo mission but I can assure you it won't take long until we do.\n\nFor now we have orders to patrol the area as Soviet attack planes are harrassing our forces in the area non-stop.\n\nAny questions?\n\n(* Collective no *)\n
