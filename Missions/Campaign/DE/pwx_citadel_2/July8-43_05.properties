Description ###############################\ndate : 08 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 17:15\nweather : Poor\n###############################\n\nIt looks like the weather is getting better.\n\nYesterdays statistics :\n\nOverall we lost about 22 aircraft.\n170 enemy aircraft shot down.\n\nThe press reports the following :\n\n"The enemy forces lost at least 862 tanks. This also includes the heavy enemy KV tanks. In the air we have also managed to cause hevay losses to the enemy. 846 enemy aircraft have been officially confirmed to be shot down. This during only three days of fighting.\n\nThe Soviets have thrown in almost all of their reserves in an attempt to smash our superior Panzer army. This resulted in heavy fighting along the entire front."\n\nTo get back on the daily topic.\nWe have only had only marginal gains in terrain. Although the press reports different it's only to push moral.\n\n... K\u00FCrt : How about the kill claims are those false?\n\nNo they are true. However the communist enemy seems to have loads and loads more.\nThey don't seem to care about one man more or less.\n\nI think the hardest battle is still to come.\n\nAt the very moment we are the side that is throwing in desperately more forces to get the offensive going.\n\n... Rainer : Isn't it yet then?\n\nWell little.\n\nBut we didn't quite achieved the planning.\nActually we are lacking behind.\n\nAt the moment of speaking a huge formation of panzers is heading towards Fatezh.\nRecon already showed us that the Soviets are prepared for this.\nThe count shows at least 200 tanks on one photograph.\n\nNone can tell how much their real number is.\n\nThe same aircraft yo have escorted earlier today has been refueled and reloaded and is prepared for another sortie on Soviet armour.\n\n... Sebastian : Ju-87 G tank busters?\n\nYes the 37Mm Flak 18 equipped ones indeed.\n\nMake sure they get through alive.\nAt the same time ensure your own survival because I don't know who holds that sector at the end of the battle.\n\nBe prepared to face the biggest tank battle you might ever see.\n
