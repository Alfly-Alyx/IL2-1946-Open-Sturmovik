My feet stuck out of the blankets so I was woken up by very cold feet as someone left the door open.\n\n... Sebastian : Yaiks!!\n\nI suppose that someone to be you Sebastian.\n\n... Sebastian : oh??\n\nYou were the last to leave my cabinet.\n\n... Sebastian : oh, oops. Sorry.\n\nNever mind, just pay attention to it next time.\n\n... Sebastian: Will do sir.\n\nOkay, well I called you two over here for a hit and run mission.\n\nIntelligence has informed us that an ammunition train has just arrived at Leningrad.\n\nYour kites have been armed with SC-500 bombs.\n\nYour task will be to move in at full speed, drop your payload and get your asses out of there.\n\nYou will fly low and fast.\n\nEnemy flak is supposed to be deadly.\n\nTherefore speed and low altitude is of the essence.\n\nAny questions?\n\n... Sebastian : What is that intelligence exactly you are talking about?\n\nSome Russian informant.\n\n... Sebastian : Ah a nice bloke that radioed us some nice information.\n\nExactly!\n\nAny further questions regarding your mission?\n\n... Sebastian : No sir.\n\n... : Nope!\n\nOkay, good luck and stay low!\n\nOh and by the way.\nSet your bomb delay at 2 seconds or more.\n
