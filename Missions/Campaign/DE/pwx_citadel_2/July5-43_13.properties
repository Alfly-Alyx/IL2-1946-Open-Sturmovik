Description ###############################\ndate : 05 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 11:20\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nAllright, Sebastian,\n\nWelcome back to your squadron.\nWhat the heck you were doing there man!!!\n\nIt could have cost you your life!!!\n\n... Sebastian : Sorry sir, I got a bit too enthusiast and I just wanted to get them.\n\nWell they got you.\nJust don't do it again!!\n\nRight now you might see your airplanes are readied for the next strike and probably you will be wondering what the target will be.\n\nMost airstrikes agains our airfields and positions are launched from the Kursk airfield.\n\nIts quite a distance into enemy territory but for the Soviets this is a relative safe airfield. Until now of course.\n\nYour flight altitude will be low to avoid detection as long as possible. So the Soviets will have only a minimal number of aircraft airborne when you arrive at the airfield.\n\nSo, any questions?\n\n...Rainer : Yeah, just us? Or should we escort something?\n\nStupid of mine to forget that. \n\nMajor Leie told me we would have to escort 1 Schl Staffel HS129B's.\n\nWe have quite number of aircraft on this mission so we should be able to overwhelm the Soviets.\n\n... Sebastian : You have said that before.,,,,\n\nI know but this time is different.\n\n... Sebastian : I hope.\n\nLast questions before we leave?\n\nCome on, lets go.\n
