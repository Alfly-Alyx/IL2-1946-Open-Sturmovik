Description ###############################\ndate : 06 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 18:40\nweather : Average\n###############################\n\nThe pocket is closed.,\nUnfortunately we didn't manage to cut off the other element of the army we are facing now.\n\nThe Soviets are bringing up some stiff resistance now. Instead of what we expected their resistance when surrounded did not crumble but in grew even stronger. And heavy fighting is now taking place.\n\nIn an attempt to weaken their will to fight we have send in a group of Ju-88's of KG5 that will bomb the area.\n\nIt won't be a pin point accurate attack because we can't see a thing through the dense layer of trees.\nBut we should be able to hit something.\n\nWe have gotten some coordinates from our ground troops and we will use them.\n\nEscort the Ju-88's and make sure all return.\n\nGood luck!\n
