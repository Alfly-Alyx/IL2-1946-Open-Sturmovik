Description ###############################\ndate : 06 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 07:30\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\n(* You are in your barrak and your staffel leader walks in. Not for a briefing but just a social chat. *)\n\nGood morning,\n\nI hope you like your new base.\n\n... : Yes sir, very large. Many but many aircraft.\n\n... Sebastian : Yeah, it is impressive.\n\n... : By the way sir, is this the airfield wherefrom our bombers fly when we e.g. have to escort He-111's or Ju-88's?\n\nYes it is.\n\n... Rainer : Funny to see our barraks build into our aircraft protection blastwalls.\n\n... : You call that funny?\n... : When you are sleeping and a Fw-190 engine starts next to you?\n\n... Rainer : It are our own aircraft remember? So if they start you should be awake anyway.\n\n... : Allright, but what if your aircraft is under repair and the mechanics start your kite to test it?\n\n(* A funny looking small guy with a small mustache shaved exactly the same way as Hitler's mustache.\nIt looks ridiculous but still it is a populair way to shave your mustache.\n\nYou really wonder why because of this way of shaving it rather looks like he had a very long Mexican mustache,  and he had a fight with his wife and she grabbed both ends of his mustache and pulled it off. \n\nAnd the tiny strip beneath his nose is all that is left. *)\n\nGentlemen,\n\n(* Silent *)\n\nLet's introduce myself to you. My name is Hans Kieffer!\n\nI am in charge around here.\n\nIf I am correct you belong to JG-54 Stab I?\n\n... : Yes sir!, that's correct.\n\nYES IS all I need to know!!\n\n(* Ah someone with a great sense of humour. *)\n\nThis base will probably be your new home for the next couple of weeks. \n\nI have seen some of your aircraft and they are in a terrible state.\n\nTherefore you must use some older Bf-109G2's for a short period.\n\nIn the meantime your current aircraft will be cleaned, repaired and repainted.\n\n(* How nice..... *)\n\nJust spoke to Major Leie, and he wants you to fly a patroll over your old airfield.\n\nWe still have some personell running around there to clean up everything of value.\nAnd they just reported through a field wireless that the enemy even though the airfield is almost abandoned they keep harrassing it.\n\nQuestions?\n\nNo??!!\n\nLeave!!.\n\n(* Right!!! We didn't even had a chance to ask any questions. *)\n\n\n
