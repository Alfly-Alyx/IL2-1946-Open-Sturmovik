Description ###############################\ndate : 11 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 19:00\nweather : Poor\n###############################\n\nI am getting crazy of that smell. Have a terrible headache due to that gasoline smell.\nWe are flying approx 200 a 300 sorties a day ans still it isn't enough!!\n\n... Sebastian: I don't want to be rude sir, but what are you mumbling about?\n\nNah nothing, just getting sick of this dead end road situation.\n\nWe are doing the max we can but all efforts seem to be in vane.\n\n... Kurt: It is not sir!! We have stopped enemy air operations almost every time again!!\n\nAh man shut up. You don't know what you are talking about. You haven't read the confidential reports.\nAnd to make things worse we do have a spy hanging around at high command office.\n\n... Rainer: What do you mean sir?\n\nOrders reach the Soviets earlier than they reach our own command posts in the field.\n\n... Sebastian: Yaiks!!\n\n... Kurt: What's that castle on that picture sir?\n\nThat's the castle our Schlachtflieger are about to attack.\nEnemy forces are trying to cross the river South of Stanovoe.\nAnd our ground troops are desperately trying to stop them.\n\nThis castle is located just at the other side of the river. The hostile side to be precise.\nIt offers the enemy a perfect view at our positions and therefore they are well able to direct their artillery with pinpoint accuracy. And with deadly results.\n\nThis castle will be flattened. Or at least we will do an attempt to do so.\n\nYou guys will escort.\nOnce again.\n\n\n\n\n#############\nNote:\n\nMission based on facts, however exact location, date and look are fictional.\n
