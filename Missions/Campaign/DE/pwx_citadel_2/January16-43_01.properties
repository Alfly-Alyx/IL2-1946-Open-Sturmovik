I sure hope it will get better because otherwise we would have to postpone our air operations.\n\n... Sebastian : Well I could use some rest.\n\nYou will get all the rest you need when Germany has won the war.\n\n... Rainer : IF we WILL win the war. That's the question.\n\nDid I ask you for comments?\n\nNo!\n\nAnyway heavy fightings have started at the front near Nikolskoe.\nAnd enemy recon planes flying in and out repeatingly indicates us we should be prepared for an air raid on that area.\n\n... : Ah well, so that means we are going in again?\n\nExactly!\n\nYou are not hired to play snow fight like you did most of the day yesterday.\n\n... : Well it was fun though.\n\nWell war ain't fun and you are not hired for fun.\n\n... : Come on man, give me a break. Be a tiny bit less serious. We are serious enough already.\n\nShut up and head for Nikolskoe.\n
