Description ###############################\ndate : 13 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 12:00\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nI don't think you are pleased to see me back again because it means you have to go back up again.\n\nYou are all aware of the painful situatiion we are are in now.\nYou know we lost Shlisselburg and Kirovsk.\n\nThe Soviets are trying to ressuply their troops located near Otradnoe with fresh supplies by the air in an attempt to increase their resistance.\n\nCausing them to become ever more dangerous to the troops stationed at Mga.\n\nThe battles around Mga are already very intense but if the Soviets keep on pushing like they do now they will split us up by nightfall.\n\nSpotters have detected a group of Soviet supply planes taking off that are probably heading towards Pavlovo.\n\nTake off now and intercept those transports.\n\nMake sure their payload won't land where intended.\n\nGood luck.\n
