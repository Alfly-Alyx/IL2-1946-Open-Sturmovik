Description ###############################\ndate : 09 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 18:09\nweather : Hazy\n###############################\n\nDespite your efforts our Panzers have suffered major losses.\nFor the first time the Soviets made use of their new SU-152.\nA major sluggish monster. Ugly to look at. Ugly in design.But equipped with a low velocity yet powerfull 152.4-mm ML-20 is proving effective against our Tigers and Panthers. Although only from the side from short and medium range our tanks have been ambushed.\n\nYet again one of our own mechanized units is falling in to keep our advance going and is moving forward to face the Soviet armour.\n\nRecon already showed us that the Soviet SP guns have been withdrawn and a batallion of medium tanks is now facing our spearhead.\n\nBefore you ask Sebastian. You will most likely face enemy attack planes as those have been used almost constanly today during every armoured attack we have launched. \n\nThough you won't be alone. We have also send in a group of Hs 129 Schlachtflieger to attack enemy armour from the top.\n\nWe expect the chaos to be big enough to let them get away unharmed but you have to keep an eye on them in case enemy fighters spot them.\n\n... Kurt : Allright, let's go then!!\n
