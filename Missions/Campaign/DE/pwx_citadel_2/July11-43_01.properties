Description ###############################\ndate : 11 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 07:00\nweather : Rain\n###############################\n\nWeather is terrible again.\n\nGood morning by the way.\n\nOur forces are harrassed throughout the night by enemy planes.\n\nThis is causing big difficulties because our tanks do not reach the front in time.\n\nA big pros though is that the front has stabilized and it looks like the Soviet offensive has halted.\n\nThe bad thing is you have to go in once again.\n\nEnemy air presence in sector K-12 is quite dense. You are ordered to patrol the area.\n\nGood luck\n
