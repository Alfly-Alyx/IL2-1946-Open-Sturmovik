Description ###############################\ndate : 12 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 11:30\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIt looks like we will have to abandon Shlisselburg soon.\n\nThe Soviets are pressing very hard.\n\nTo make things worse the Soviets are trying to pocket in our forces in Shlisselburg by trying to overrun Kirovsk.\n\nHeavy bombardments are taking place from artillery positions located in Dubrovka.\n\nTherefore our forces will strike Dubrovka in any minute.\n\nYour orders are to escort the Ju-88's safely in and out of the target area.\n\nThat doesn't require any further questions nor answers I assume.\n\nHave a good flight.\n
