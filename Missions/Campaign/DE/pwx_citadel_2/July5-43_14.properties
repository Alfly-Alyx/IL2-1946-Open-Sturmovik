Description ###############################\ndate : 05 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 12:15\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nAllright good to see all of you.\n\nUnfortunately some of the 1 Schlacht Staffel did not make it.\n\nThey fell into Soviet hands and I doubt if they will ever return.\n\nRight now we have to take again as a Soviet recon plane has been spotted above our main withdrawal line.\n\nWe have just reeinforced it so the Soviets should have spotted that.\n\nIn other words I expect an air raid.\n\nReady yourself for the next flight to patroll the area.\n\nSee you in five minutes, but fully ready.\n
