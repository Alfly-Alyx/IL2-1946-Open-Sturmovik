Description ###############################\ndate : 11 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 13:00\nweather : Hazy\n###############################\n\nWell that was your first combat mission.\n\nNo kills though.\n\n... : Yeah!! Before I could line out my guns my wingmen were already firing at them and at the moment I wanted to open fire the IL2's bursted into flames and tumbled down.\n\nWell you still get plenty of chances to score a kill during your stay here at Krasnovardeisk.\n\nBTW have you met your wingmen yet?\n\n... : No sir.\n\n... Sebastian : Hi my name is Sebastian. I am 23 years old but already in active service for the Luftwaffe. I am from Westfalen Germany.   My father is high ranked so he could do a good word for me as I always have been facinated by aircraft.\nNever joined the Hitlerjugend and the young fliegeniers but still I managed to get in.\n\n\n... Rainer : My name is Rainer, Rainer Br\u00F6der. I am 25 years old and I am from Nordheim am Main.\n\nOkay enough social chat.\n\nJust received an order to patrol Dubrovka.\n\nHeavy enemy air activity has been sited in that area.\n\nIt is no specific goal except for trying to gain air dominance.\n\nGood luck.\n
