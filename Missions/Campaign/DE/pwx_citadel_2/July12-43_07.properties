Description ###############################\ndate : 12 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 17:10\nweather : Rain\n###############################\n\nAh fringing weather!!\n\nIts summer!! In sake of peace can't they have normal weather in Russia for once?\n\nIce cold winters, so you would expect hot summer!! But no RAIN nothing but RAIN!\n\n... Rainer: What's the status on Sicily sir?\n\nSicily, not very good. It was mostly defended by Italian forces. low on morale, training and equipment. Some have defected some have been fled some just surrendered and some are still defended.\n\nWe had some luck though. Enemy forces launched an airborne assault at the center of Sicily. However it looks like the already present Allied ground troops were not aware of this airborne troops and thus mistaken them for us. We assume at least as they opened fire upon their own paratroopers and causing heavy losses amongst their own transport planes.\n\nJust read that, An informal telegram.\n\nAll right for now.\n\nThe Soviets are attempting to demolish our bridges and stagnate our supply and war effort. \n\nThe actual result is not that great but rather annoying. However it does cost time and time is precious. Therefore we must prevent these raids on bridges mostly performed by outdated fighter-bombers such as the I-16 Rata and P-40's.\n\nMostly unescorted.\n\nSee the map for the pre-plotted flight route.\n\nGood luck.\n
