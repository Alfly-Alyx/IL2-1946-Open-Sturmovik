Description ###############################\ndate : 05 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 13:25\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nWe got the train.\nThe losses we sustained however are not acceptable.\n\n... Sebastian : Sir, what else would you expect?\n... Sebastian : We had quite some opposition.\n\nYes I know but we should minimize our losses.\nOtherwise this offensive might fail.\n\nI have heard that the Fuhrer is getting nervous alread.\n\nAnd all previous times the Fuhrer gets nervous it ends in a drama.\n\n... Sebastian : I have a feeling that our Fuhrer gets a pain in the ass.\n... Rainer : Correction, he is a pain in the ass. He is trying to control everything to the smallest detail.\n... Rainer : If he could he would even fly our aircraft and drive our tanks and trucks.\n\nPerhaps but now.\n\nA huge formation,,,,,,\n\nDo you hear that??\n\n... Rainer : Geez!!!!!!!!!!!!! how many??\n\n20+/- or something like that.\n\n... Sebastian : I am impressed!!\n\nHehe, well thank your lovely Fuhrer for that.\n\n... Sebastian : Thanking our Fuhrer? My ass!!\n\nOkay cut the spitting on our Fuhrer and do your job.\nThose Ju-87 Tank busters need to be escorted to Kamenka.\n\nLike your previous missions expect some serious opposition.\n\nThis won't be a milk run.\nAnd keep our losses as low as possible.\n\nGood luck\n
