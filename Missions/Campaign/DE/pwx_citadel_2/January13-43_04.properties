Description ###############################\ndate : 13 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 14:00\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nLight tanks mostly armoured recon vehicles are attacking our positions.\nAlthough our forces are equipped with heavier and more powerful tanks such as the Panzer IV Ausf G and the later types even have side sch\u00FCrzen attached.  Although equipped with the mighty  KwK 43L they have great difficulties to withstand the massive number of enemy light vehicles attacking our positions simultaneous.\n\nTo make things worse they have to operate in dense forrest.\nAnd the difficult terrain is causing our vehicles to bog down almost continuously.\n\nAlso we have another problem. Enemy fighters are harassing our forces around the clock.\nSo you are tasked to keep them away.\n\nYou have support from a schwarm G2's that has already taken off.\n
