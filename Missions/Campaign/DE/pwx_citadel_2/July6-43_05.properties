No other words for that.\n\nWhile I never seen that many planes airborne at a time since the Battle over Britain in 1940.\n\n... : Sir, do you have any reports on the progress of our offensive?\n\nNot yet. Should have in in a few hours.\n\nRight now our Panzers clashed with very strong enemy forces near Tagino. Expected the Russians will bring in air support in large numbers.\n\nTherefore you guys are ordered to patroll the Tagino airspace in an attempt to keep it clear.\n\n... : Will try if it goes like yesterday it has a good prospect.\n\nYes indeed. Live after it and perhaps you'll get a medal.\n\n... Rainer : Ah cool then I have something to brag about. A piece of metal that could be very usefull.\n\n...
