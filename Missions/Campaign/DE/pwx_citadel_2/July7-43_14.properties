Description ###############################\ndate : 07 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 16:39\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nThe enemy is try to breech our lines with brute force.\nThe mass of tanks and weapons they are throwing into the battle is getting critical.\n\nDuring the entire day heavy tank battles across the entire front have been taking place.\n\nAt the moment of speaking the enemy is trying to breech our lines at sector O 14.\nAlthough we previously had Arhangelskoe we had to abandon it again due to heavy enemy pressure.\n\nI just received orders to support our forces just across the river by air.\n\nYou will lead a flight of eight 190's that is backed up by a Schl 7 geschwader in an attempt to stagnate or destroy the enemy forces.\n\nGood luck\n
