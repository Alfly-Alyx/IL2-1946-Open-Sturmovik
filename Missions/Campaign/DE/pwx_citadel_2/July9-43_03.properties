Description ###############################\ndate : 09 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 12:45\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nFatezh has fallen, but we are still lacking behind on schedule. A lot.\n\nWe should have linked up with army group south already and we are not even at 50% of our goals.\n\nBesides that the Soviets are ever growing in strength. Every day we attack it doesn't look we are decimating the Soviets but it rather looks like we are supplieng them. Just the the two headed dragon in Chinese myths. Every head you cut off two head's grow in its place.\n\nThe Soviets are the same. Every Soviet tank you destroy is replaced by two new tanks.\nSame in the air and same by the army.\n\nWe have been ordered to patrol the Fatezh air sector.\nIt is most likely you will encounter enemy aircraft.\n\n... Sebastian : In what strength?\n\nStrong!\n\nWe send in four flights.\n\nLook at the map I have here for your exact flight path.\n\nGood luck.\n
