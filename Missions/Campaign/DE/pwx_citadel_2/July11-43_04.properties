Description ###############################\ndate : 11 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 12:00\nweather : Rain\n###############################\n\nLike I said, it is raining again.\n\n... Rainer: Sir, I don't want to sit on your back but do you happen to have yesterday's statistics?\n\nYes I have.\n\nThey were somewhere on my desk.\n\n(* whipes a lot of papers from his desk. *)\n\nAh!! Here it is.\n\nYesterday \n_____________________\n\n74 enemy aircraft shot down\n10 aircraft lost to enemy fire. Including AA.\n\nThe amount of aircraft shot down yesterday is considerably less than the previous days.\n\nNevertheless it is a good score.\nEspecially when comparing to our own losses.\n\n... Sebastian: Nevertheless sir, you should not forget the Soviets can recover their losses.\n... Sebastian: Even though we lost only ten aircraft. Those ten aircraft are ten aircraft for that we will only receive five new aircraft.\n\n... Rainer: If only we get new aircraft.\n\n... Sebastian: Exactly!\n\nOkay guys, lets cut the chat and keep it for later.\n\nWe have launched an attack to protect our Eastern flank.\nWe assume, and mostly that's correct that the enemy will raid our forces by air.\n\nTherefore once again you guys are tasked to patroll the area in an attempt to prevent enemy air raids on our panzers.\n\nGood luck!\n
