Description ###############################\ndate : 20 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 09:30\nweather : Poor\n###############################\n\nGoodmorning guys,\n\nYour target for today will be Seskar.\n\n... : Seskar???!! What do we have to do there?\n\n... Rainer : Can't the Fins attack that AF?\n\nThey can but you won't attack it. Just an offensive patroll.\n\n... : ........ Right!\n\nIt won't be a long flight.\n\n... Sebastian : But a risky one.\n\nYou can walk back to shore when you get downed.\n\n... Sebastian : Sure, there's ice but do you have any clue of the risks of doing that?\n\n... Sebastian : The ice isn't everywhere strong enough to support human weight.\n\n... Sebastian : If the ice breaks and you fall through you are dead!\n\n... Sebastian : And even IF you have the luck to climb out you are frozen to death within minutes.\n\nWell I'd reccomend to take your cellphone with you in case you fall into the cold wather so you can call 911.\n\n... Sebastian : Okay we'll do.\n\nWell no questions just go.\n\nMake sure I see you within one hour.\n
