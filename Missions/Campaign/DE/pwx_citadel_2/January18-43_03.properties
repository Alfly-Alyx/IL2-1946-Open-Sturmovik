Description ###############################\ndate : 18 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 14:00\nweather : Snow\n###############################\n\nA desperate struggle is going on along almost the entire front line.\n\nSix days have passed by since the breaking of the besiege of Leningrad.\n\nAlmost continues supply vehicles have been spotted driving in and out Leningrad.\n\nWe must stop them, but the main question is how?\n\nOur own forces are under an almost constant attack by the Soviet air force who is flying almost non-stop. Snow or no snow they go on.\n\nThey have heavy losses but they don't seem to care about it.\n\nOne plane more or less who cares, one more of their men dead? Who cares.\n\nStrange attitude, sad but true.\n\nLately we even downed an IL2 who crash landed upon and its pilot survived.\n\nWhen our guys approached the crashed plane they noticed the pilot to be still alive because he was moving and having a bottle in his hands wherefrom he was drinking.\n\nWhen we opened his cockpit he mumbled something in Russian and took another drink.\nHe was a 100 percent drunk.\n\n... Sebastian : A drunk pilot??\n\nYes.\n\nWe took him away and in the truck he fell asleep. \n\nHe has slept almost 10 hours and when he was awake he had not even the slightest clue where he was and how he got there.\n\nTranslators told us he said the last thing he could remember was he stepped into his aircraft. Anything else he couldn't.\n\n... Sebastian : If their fighter pilots would do that it would be great!!\n\nOr it could also be they have great resistance to alcohol.\n\nAnyway your current mission is to protect our newly arrived Panzers near Sologubovka.\n\nDeserters have informed us about plans to raid it.\n\nHopefully he speaks the truth.\n\nBut because we have not a slightest clue about the reliability of this man we only send in four crates.\n\nYou amongst it.\n\n... : Great!\n\nDon't mourn you only had two flights today and this is your third. After that you probably have about sixteen hours you can spend to your own liking.\n\nHave a good flight.\n
