Description ###############################\ndate : 05 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 19:00\nweather : Good\n###############################\n\nGood evening,\n\nWhen looking back at this day I am sorry to report we have not gained the terrain we were hoping for.\n\nThe number of enemy aircraft we shot down however was staggering.\n\nThe day is not yet over but already we destroyed nearly 200 enemy aircraft.\n\n... Sebastian : Well I assume we are about to fly another mission so if the Soviets dare to show up that number might even increase.\n\nYes you are correct. But it might be just a very boring patrol mission.\n\nThree FW-190's will fly a regular patrol over our frontline.\n\nFirst flight target : Zmievka.\nSecond flight target : North East of Glazunovka.\nThird flight target : North West of Buzuluk.\nThen in a circle movement you fly towards Lubjanki and then head back home.\n\nShould be easy isn't it?\n\n... Rainer : Sounds like.\n\nIt is.\n\nNow have a good flight.\n
