Description ###############################\ndate : 06 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 16:30\nweather : Average\n###############################\n\nFront is getting a little quiet now.\n\nHowever I expect that we will launch a final push for the day during the evening.\n\n... : Why do you expect that?\n\nWe got a momentum last morning, but we gained only ver little.\nEspecially if you look at the effort we have put into it.\n\nTherefore I assume they want to throw in some more to keep it going.\n\nBut for now,,,,,\n\nA group of Soviet Stormbirds is approaching and their assumed target is Mokhovoe.\n\nWe have just failed to intercept an enemy recon aircraft above it and now a group of bombers is heading in that direction.\n\n... Rainer : What do we have there that's worth bombing it?\n\nA large group of Panzers. They are refueling and refitting for the next battle.\n\n... : That explains.\n\nYes, but you have wide support. Two groups of Bf-109's will join you so you shouldn't have to worry about enemy fighters.\n\nAny questions?\n\n... : No,\n\n... Rainer : When are our aircraft ready?\n\nThis evening.\n\nAnyone else?\n\n..... (* collective silence *)\n\nWell, have a nice flight.\n
