Description ###############################\ndate : 11 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 13:00\nweather : Poor\n###############################\n\nWe are going toi raid Troitskoe airfield.\nThis airfield is being used very actively by the Soviets.\n\nWe should have raided this airfield much earlier but high command refused this as it would cost us too many losses.\nThe initial plan was to take the airfield while our groundtroops would advance in that area.\n\nIn other words they wanted the ground troops to take the airfield.\nBut as it looks now it is only a minor chance this will happen so therefore we will raid the airfield in an attempt to soften up enemy air operations.\n\nGood luck!\n
