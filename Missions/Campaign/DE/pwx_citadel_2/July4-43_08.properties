Description ###############################\ndate : 04 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 19:45\nweater : Thunder\t\n###############################\n\nWelcome back at base.\n\nHave a funny news item for you.\nA Soviet pilot landed at our base.\n\nIt was one of the aircraft that was attacking this base.\n\nOur translators tell us that he was frightened by one of our AA guns that struck him and he wanted to put his aircraft on the ground as soon as possible.\nBut his aircraft doesn't even has a single scratch and is fully airworthy.\n\nSo it now has a bunch of quickly painted German markings.\n\nReady for testing.\n\nAnyone to volunteer?\n\n... Yeah let me do it.\n\nOkay follow me.\n\nAs you see its a pretty rugged aircraft. Not a beauty like most of our planes but its aquadate for the job it has been designed for.\n\n.. Yeah I can see that.\n\nOur translator who... ah there he is. Hubert, have you had a nice chat with our Soviet friend?\nYeah but it is one of the silent types.\n\n...Aha, well as long as he tells us how to fly that Stormbird.\n\nYes he did.\n\nCome with me so he can tell you how to do it.\n\nAfter he explained you how to fly that thing we will take him away in a lorry.\n\n.. You won't kill him I hope?\n\nNo way, why should we?\nFor certain he will live through the war now.\n\nI have been ensured that there's taken good care of POW's.\n\nBy the way before I forget to mention.\nWe have set up some targets along your route.\n\nI have been told as I have not seen it myself that its a circle with a bunch of captured and useless ZIS trucks inside.\nAlso a bunch of fire's to lite up the target a bit.\n\n.. : ZIS trucks, weren't that Russian trucks?\n\nYes that are Russian trucks.\n\n
