Description ###############################\ndate : 31 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 11:00\nweather : Clear\n###############################\n\nGood news,\n\nOne of our spotter planes has sighted the damaged enemy sub.\n\n... Sebastian : Damaged enemy sub? I have been missing something.\n\nYesterday a group of Bf 110's spotted the sub. They were only equipped with Mg's and 20mm canons but they attacked the sub anyway.\n\nIt was forced to dive but appearently it  was damaged as it seems to have no intentions at all to dive when our spotter approaches. Instead it opens fire with its dek guns.\n\nYour aircraft have been equipped with SC-500 bombs.\n\nTry to sink that sub.\n
