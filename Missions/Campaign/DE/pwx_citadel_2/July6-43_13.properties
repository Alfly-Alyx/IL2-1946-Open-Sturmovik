Description ###############################\ndate : 06 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 17:20\nweather : Average\n###############################\n\nYour aircraft are ready now.\nThey just need to dry so I insist you to use your lend planes once again.\n\n... : So the flying zebra's continue again?\n\n... Rainer : Zebra's????\n\n... : Yeah I mean the different colors we are flying. Not just one scheme for all aircraft but two or three different schemes.\n\n... Rainer : I don't know how you resemble that with a zebra.\n\nDoesn't matter!!\nListen up.\n\nThe enemy is resisting heavily.\nThe positions we have attacked one hour a go have fallen. However they withdrew to a new fline in the forrest.\n\nNow its a bit of tree to tree fighting.\n\n\n... Sebastian : Yaiks!!!!, glad I am 1000 meters higher!!\n\nYeah I understand. But you have to go there again.\n\nThe enemy is harassing our boys almost constant from the air.\n\nTherefore you must patrol the area and make sure no enemy fighter, fighter bomber or bomber gets through.\n\nGood luck!\n
