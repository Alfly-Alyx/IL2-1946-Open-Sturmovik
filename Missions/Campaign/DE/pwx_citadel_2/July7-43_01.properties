Description ###############################\ndate : 07 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 07:00\nweather : Average\n###############################\n\nGood morning,\n\nI am sorry to say I do not yet have yesterday's statistics.\n\nAs I see you already had breakfast?\n\n... : Yep.\n\nHmm, well I didn't so when you are gone that's the first thing I will do because I am starving.\n\nI have some good news for you. During the night the pocket has fallen.\n\nAround five o clock the Russians came walking to our troops with their hands up.\n\nSo our effort has payed off.\n\nI want you to meet someone. \nSome of you have met him already. He arrived yesterday with the Ju-52's you had to escort to base.\n\nHe will be your wingman Rainer.\n\nHis name is Kurt Merx.\n\n... Rainer : Nice to meet you Kurt.\n\nMore good news, you got your aircraft back.\n\nThey now have as you requested their own individual markings.\n\n... : Yeah I noticed the black nose on my kite. Pretty unusual paintscheme.\n\nYeah well it was as Rainer suggested to paint all leading aircraft this way.\nBut I don't think this will become a standard.\n\nOkay, on topic.\n\nLast morning a recon plane pictured many tanks located at "Verhnesmorodino". ... What a name, can't they just call it Frankfurt or Berlin or Schwartzwald or some other more obviousname?\n\nA large group of dive bombers is set out to attack this Veros... town.\n\nYou are ordered to escort them.\n\nKurt,, this will be your first mission with your new Staffel.\n\nGood luck!\n
