Description ###############################\ndate : 14 / 5 / 1943\ntime : 11:20\nweather : Poor\n###############################\n\nHas any of you ever encountered a British Mosquito?\n\n... Sebastian : Had enough mosquito's in Russia. Still hear the annoying buzz near my ear.\n\nNo not that mosquito.\nThe Mosquito is a British aircraft made entirely out of wood. So very hard to see on radar.\n\nIt has excellent range so it can penetrate deep into our motherland and get out again also.\n\n... Rainer : What do you call deep?\n\nBerlin.\n\n... Sebastian : WOW!!\n\nWell those buggers are approaching the Bremer U-boat werf right now.\n\nGet your ass over there asap.\n\nRemember they fly low and VERY fast!!\n\n... Rainer : Sort of IL2's?\n\nYeah sort of but a heck lot faster.\n
