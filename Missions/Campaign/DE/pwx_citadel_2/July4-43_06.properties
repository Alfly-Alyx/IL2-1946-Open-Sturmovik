It were only small holes.\nDon't think it will bother me too much.\n\nThat's not where its about. Small holes will cause a crack and your windscreen has to be replaced.\n\n.. Rainer : I know I just drop in but I heard about the Sebastian's windscreen. I just polished mine and in the meantime the ground personell has replaced his cockpit. So to give you an answer. yes it is fixed.\n\nOkay, that's great. I need two guys to do a regular patrol above enemy lines. Probably a zero contact mission.\n\nI want to know if there's any enemy activity in the air above the Kursk region.\n\n..Sebastian : I smell that the offensive is not far away sir.\n\nNo you are right. but when?\n\n.. Rainer : I'd say tomorrow.\n\n,,,\n\nLets get to business. Your flight will be nothing else then a flight towards kursk then to Konyshevka and then to Pervoavgustovskiy.\n\nThat's it.\n\nAny questions?\n\n..Sebastian. : No sir. None.\n\n... : No sir.\n\nOkay, see you at dinner.\n\n\n\n
