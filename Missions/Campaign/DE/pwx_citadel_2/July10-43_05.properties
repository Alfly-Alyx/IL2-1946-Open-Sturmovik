Description ###############################\ndate : 10 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 11:00\nweather : Rain\n###############################\n\nGents,\n\nThe rain has stopped and that means we will start performing riads on the enemy.\n\n... Rainer : At last.\n\n... Sebastian : It's about time.\n\n... Kurt : What is it we are about to escort?\n... Kurt : As that is why we are here I assume.\n\nYou are correct.\n\nA gigantic group of Schlachtflieger has taken off and is heading towards Kostino.\n\nThere they will attack enemy reserves waiting to take part in the battle.\n\nThey will fly overhead in any minute so I suggest you to go to your aircraft asap.\n\nBTW expect heavy resistance because I assume this is the long awaited Soviet counter offensive.\n
