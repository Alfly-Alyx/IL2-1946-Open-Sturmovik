Rainer : I'll go.\n\n... : Great!! thanks buddy!\n... Rainer : you're welcome, but we need to go now before ..\n\nYeah I forgot to mention. The Russians will try to look for him as well so loiter around in the area and cover our ground forces.\n\nThey will retreat within an hour again.\n\nWhen you found him let us know by radio.\n\nDestroy any Soviet truck nearby.\n
