Description ###############################\ndate : 05 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 07:15\nweater : Good\n###############################\n\nGlad to be back,\n\nAnd glad to see all of you again.\nNever seen that many airplanes attacking in one row. Especially not on the Eastern front.\n\nThe last time I saw such numbers was in 1940 but they were on the good side. Our side.\n\nAnyway, we have managed to gather a large number of \tfighters large enough to overwhelm the Soviets and we will perform a fightersweep.\n\nIts a joing JG 52, 54 fightersweep. Should do it I think.\n\n,,, Rainer : Can't the boys of JG 51 just join us?\n\nDon't know but sure could I think. But  it wasn't my decision.\n\nOkay, we'll head to Zheleznogorsk and back. That should do it.\n\n,,, Sebastian : That's not far??..\n\nIts just behind enemy lines but we cross the frontline. And as it is active we'll surely run into something.\n\nHave a nice flight/\n
