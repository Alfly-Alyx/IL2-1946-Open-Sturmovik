Description ###############################\ndate : 04 / 7 / 1943\ntime : 09:00\nweater : Good\n###############################\n\nGood morning,\n\nStill sleepy I see,\nWell to those that have arrived yesterday,\n\nWelcome to your new home. And to those new to this Geschwader, welcome to Jagdgeschwader 54.\n\nOkay, lets get to business we'll do the social talk after your flight.\n\nYour first mission will be nothing cool nor exciting. Just some regular patrolling over the frontline. \n\nYou will head to Turova and Zmevka and then return to base. I know it is not too far away but it is just to familiarize yourself a bit with this area.\n\nWhen you return you might notice some more FW-190's heading this way. They belong to I./SchlG 1.\nThey too will share this base with us.\n\nHave a nice flight.\n\n\n\n\n
