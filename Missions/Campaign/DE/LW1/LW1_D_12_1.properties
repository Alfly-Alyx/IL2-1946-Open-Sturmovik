Staffel / Jagdgeschwader 77\n\n7. Oktober 1941\n\n==============================\n\nLage:\n--------\n\nThe war in Russia is making very good progress.\n\nPropaganda is telling that the russians will be beaten soon.\nYou're not so sure.\n\nAllthough the Wehrmacht achieved great victories the war is much harder than \nforeseen. The Russian soldiers are fighting stubborn even at the worst circumstances. \nCut off units often refuse to give up and even small pockets have to be erased by \npower. \nThe Soviets are willing to take huge losses. \nThis behaviour inflicts also greater losses on our forces. \n\nOnce titled as 'Untermenschen' the Russian soldier as a combatant is a much harder \nopponent than ever thought. \n\nAnother surprise is the quality of the russian weapons.\nAlthough often regarded as simple it's battle worth is astonishing. The T- 34 tank came \nas a total and bad surprise to our tank and anti tank troops. It can only hardly be \nstopped. \n\nThe war in the north to take Leningrad didn't went as intended.\nNow Hitler wants Moscow!\n\nYour Staffel was ordered to transfer to the airfield Syschewka.\n\n\nEinsatzbefehle:\n---------------------\nLand at the airfield Syschewka.\n\nStartzeit: unterwegs\nEinsatzflugh\u00F6he: 500m\nEinsatzmuster: Bf-109F-2\nZusatzbewaffnung: n/a\n\nWetterlage:\nBlind.\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\n\n
