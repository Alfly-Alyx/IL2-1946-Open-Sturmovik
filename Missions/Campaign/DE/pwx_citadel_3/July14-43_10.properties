Description ###############################\ndate : 14/ 07/ 1943 \ntime : 12:55 \nweather : Poor\t\n###############################\n\nIn the battle that is taking place between Belgorod and Orel our army have reached their goal to encircle and destroying many Soviet troops and weaponry. Also many pow's have been taken.\n\nStreams of prisoners of war can be seen everywhere. Almost like the opening months of this war.\nOn June the 11th the statistics of pows is at 28.000 enemy men.\n\nThe losses in tanks is 1654 and 1484 guns.\n\nAround Belgorod alone we already knocked out 129 tanks at the seventh day of the offensive.\n\nThe day before that at June the 9th we succeeded in destroying almost 220 enemy tanks and at least 70 enemy aircraft. \nA big number of tanks destroyed is due to this Geschwader. I think you can be proud of yourself.\nRight now you have a chance to increase that score.\n\nA huge number of Soviet tanks is moving towards the frontline.\n\nThey are already under a bombardement of Howitzers but air cover is preffered.\n\nGood luck.\n\n
