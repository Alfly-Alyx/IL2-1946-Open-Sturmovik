Description ###############################\ndate : 20/ 07/ 1943\ntime : 05:00\nweather : Good    \n###############################\n\nHuge losses have been suffered in men and machine the last couple of days.\nMuch of the terrain gained during the offensive has been lost.\n\nMany tanks have been destroyed by mines or Soviet ground attack aircraft.\n\nIt looks like a doomed situation. The amount of Soviet tanks destroyed exceeds our own losses by far. Estimated they have lost more than three to four times the number of tanks we have lost. The fifth Guards tank army has been decimated by 50 percent.\n\nHowever the Soviets have a great number of production facilities located in the Ural mountains. We are not able to reach them and allowing them to produce a top number of at least 2000 T-34's a month.\n\nOur own factories don't even manage to reach a 50 Tigers a month.\nAnd out of that a large number doesn't even make it to the front due to heavy enemy air activity, railway sabotage and technical problems.\n\nYour current mission should not be suppressed by these statistics. I want you to give all you got and try to stop the massive hordes of Soviet tanks.\n
