Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description August 27, 1940. \n\nThe attacks continues without pause, only interrupted by spells of bad weather. \n\nWe in the Luftwaffe consistently vary our tactics in our attempts to break through the RAF defences. Previously we launched many free-roving fighter sweeps, "Freie Jagd", to draw up RAF fighters. RAF fighter controllers, however, have often been able to detect these and position squadrons to avoid them, obviously attempting to preserve fighter strength for the bomber formations. \n\nWe also try using small formations of bombers as bait, covering them with large numbers of escorts. This has been more successful, but escort duty ties the fighters to the bombers' slow speed and makes them more vulnerable.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday bombers will hit another RAF airfield, Manston, outside Margate.\n\nOur task is to protect them, flying close escort: it's not too fun, but orders are orders.\n\nGood Luck!\n
