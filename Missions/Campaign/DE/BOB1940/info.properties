Name Storm over England
Description The date is July 1940. Following the French surrender less than two weeks ago, most of us believed the war was practically over and the British (defeated on the continent and without European allies) would see reason and quickly come to terms with us. But no. Well, then we must force them! There is talk of invasion. But first the RAF must be crushed!\n\nYou are a German fighter pilot, flying the Bf109E, and the aerial attacks on Great Britain are just about to start.\n\nThis is a semi-historical campaign, 22 missions long, covering the Battle of Britain from the German side, starting in July 1940, with the battles over the Channel, and ending in October, with the fighter-bomber sweeps over the southern coast of England\n\nPlease select a low starting rank, like Leutenant. Regarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option.\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have the AAA Mod UI 1.1 installed!
