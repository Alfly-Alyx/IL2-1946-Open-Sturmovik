Name Fighter Sweep
Short In order to draw enemy fighters away from the Luftflotte 3 effort against a new British convoy going through the Channel, we are doing a big Fighter sweep over the area Margate - Dover - Folkestone.\n\nYour Staffel will participate in that sweep. Good luck!\n
Description October 8, 1940. \n\nThe Battle of Britain is over. At least for us. \n\nThe night-time bombing of London and other cities continues. As many as 250-300 bombers hit the enemy capital every night. (This tactic has greatly reduced the losses of the bombers.) The aerial bombing is partly aimed at the destruction of industrial targets, but the main objective is the breaking the morale of the civilian population. Terror bombing, if you will...\n\nNow in hindsight, it is clear that we in the Luftwaffe have been ill-served by lack of good military intelligence about the British defences, especially the RAF. \n\nThere has therefore been a mindset among us that the Engl\u00E4nder would soon run out of frontline fighters. Our Intel seems to have seriously oversestimated the enemy losses. Many times we've heard that Fighter Command was about to collapse, only to discover that they were able to send up big defensive formations at will.\n\nIt has now been confirmed that the invasion of England is postponed. \n\nA number of Fighter units have already been withdrawn, and also - as tellingly - most of the big transport units that were waiting to ferry paratroopers over the Channel.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe fighter-bomber sweeps over the south of England continues, though. \n\nThe target this time is outside Canterbury, one of those big radio units - we understand they are called "Radar" - that the British use to controll their fighters with such perfection. (We should have knocked them out earlier...)\n\nThis is your last mission!\n\nOur unit is leaving the Channel Front, going back to Germany, to requip and rest. Say goodbye to the French ladies, to nights in Paris and to Kanalkrankheit! \n\nLet's start hoping for a REAL war.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the final mission in this campaign. Thanks for playing it and congratulations for completing it!\n/Peter K a.k.a. Poltava\n
