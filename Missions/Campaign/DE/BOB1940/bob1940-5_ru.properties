Name Fighter Sweep
Short Yes, another "Freie Jagd" - Free Hunting - over the Kanal, in the area south of Dover. As usual we want to lure the British Fighters into combat over the Sea, thus slowly bleeding Fighter Command to death.\n
Description July 13, 1940.\n\nWe are now about to step up the aggressive sweeps over the Channel. Which is good, as the clashes over the British convoys has continued. And we are coming out as the victors, at least most of the time. (The Stukas has taken a beating, though.)\n\nWe've had a Top Secret briefing with the head of Luftflotte 2, Generalfeldmarschall Kesselring, and the estimates are that it will take four days of concentrated, all-out fighting to defeat the RAF Fighter Command in southern England. Which sounds a bit optimistic to me...\n\nAnyway, this is to be followed by a four-week offensive during which the bombers and long-range fighters will destroy all military installations throughout the country and wreck the British aircraft industry. \n\nThe campaign against Britain is planned to begin with attacks on airfields near the coast, gradually moving inland to attack the ring of sector airfields defending London. \n\nHowever, it is important that we in the Luftwaffe preserve our strength in order to be able to support the land invasion of England, Operation Seel\u00F6we. \n\nThe only alternative to the goal of air superiority is a terror bombing campaign aimed at the civilian population, but this is considered a last resort and is expressly forbidden by the F\u00FChrer.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYes, another "Freie Jagd" - Free Hunting - over the Kanal, in the area south of Dover. As usual we want to lure the British Fighters into combat over the Sea, thus slowly bleeding Fighter Command to death.\n\nGood Luck!\n
