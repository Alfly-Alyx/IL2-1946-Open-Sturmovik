Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description September 7, 1940. \n\nThere has been a surprising change of strategy: today we will start attacking LONDON!\n\nIt all started when, on the night of 23 August, bombs were accidentally dropped on London, and the Engl\u00E4nder answered in kind.\n\nMore RAF raids on Berlin in retaliation led to the F\u00FChrer withdrawing his directive forbidding attacks on civilian targets, and in a speech delivered on the 4 September, he threatened to obliterate British cities if British bombing runs against Germany would not stop. \n\nThey haven't.\n\nSo four days ago Reichfeldmarschall G\u00F6ring gave the go-ahead to bomb London, having received reports that the average strength of RAF squadrons is down to five or seven fighters out of 12 and their airfields in the area is out of action. \n\nSo as well as retaliating for their attacks against Berlin, we think that a direct attack against London will force them to use their last fighter reserves.\n\nThis could be the decisive blow!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nMassive waves of bombers will attack London. You will fly detached escort, i.e. fly a bit in fron of the attack units and draw off enemy interceptors.\n\nThis shouldn't be too hard. We think that Fighter Command is about to break any day now!\n\nBut be careful! London is JUST at the extreme limit of the Bf109's maximum range. If you dog-fight to much on max throttle up there, you will not make it all the way home! \n
