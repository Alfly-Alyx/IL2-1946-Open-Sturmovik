Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description September 23, 1940. \n\nThere is no need in denying it: the big raid of September 15 was a BIG failure. \n\nThe RAF fighters rose in bigger numbers than ever before. The total casualties on this critical day were 60 of our aircraft shot down versus only some 25-30 RAF. That's really, really bad!\n\nWe have to face it: Fighter Command is NOT knocked out. And in the face of mounting losses in men, aircraft and the lack of adequate replacements, our bomber units will have to switch from daylight to night-time bombing.\n\nThere are also rumors that four days ago the F\u00FChrer ordered the POSTPONEMENT of preparations for the invasion of Britain. Operation "Seel\u00F6we" is off. At least for now.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday we will mount a big Freie Jagd around the Thames Estuary. \n\nBoth our unit and a unit of Bf 110's will participate. The mission is mostly symbolic, if you ask me, to prove to the Engl\u00E4nder that we still have overwhelming power. (Their propaganda is already telling the world that they have won the so called Battle of Britain - what cheek!)\n\nWith a bit of luck the RAF will rise to the occasion, even though there are no bombers involved, and we will have a bit of old-fashioned dog-fight! (And no more of this boring close escort!)\n\nGood luck!\n
