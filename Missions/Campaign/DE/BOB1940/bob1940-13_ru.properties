Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description August 24, 1940. \n\nDue to our many casualties August the 18th has been dubbed "The Hardest Day". After the grinding battles of that day, exhaustion and bad weather has reduced operations for most of a week.\n\nIn the meanwhile we have received a number of new directives from Reichsmarschall G\u00F6ring.\n\nTheir very heavy losses has proven that the Ju 87's are too vulnerable to fighters to operate over Britain, and they have been withdrawn from the fighting. \n\nThe Bf 110 has also proven too clumsy for dogfighting with single-engined fighters, and its participation is scaled back. It will only be used when range require it or when sufficient single-engined escort can not be provided for the bombers.\n\nMany are grumbling over another order: the Fighters will from now on perform more close bomber escorts at the expense of free-hunting sweeps. We will be chained to the slow bombers! \n\nFinally, Reichsmarschall G\u00F6ring has stopped the attacks on the chain of radio location stations. These has been seen as unsuccessful. That's ok. We know that they provide some sort of early warning of raids, but most of us fighter pilots believe that anything bringing up the "Tommies" to fight is to be encouraged!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday several waves of bombers will once again hit the RAF airfield at Biggin Hill. (It has already been pretty badly torn up.) You will give them close escort, and protect them from British interceptor!\n\nDon't mess this one up! We don't want to disappoint Reichsmarschall G\u00F6ring again. \n\n
