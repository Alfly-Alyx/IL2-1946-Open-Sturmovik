Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description August 13, 1940. \n\nAdlertag! Day of the Eagle!\n\nToday, after long an frustrating delays due to masses of rain and bad weather, the aerial onslaught on the British mainland will finally start!\n\nThe first probing attacks took actually place yesterday, when the guys in that specialist fighter-bomber unit, Erprobungsgruppe 210, attacked four of those mysterious radio stations, which actually seems to be used to spot our aircraft from afar. Three of the stations were briefly taken off the air but were back working within six hours. They seem to be hard to knock out...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAdlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to participate in a big Fighter sweep towards the Canterbury area, that we hope will draw away all defending fighters from a big attack by Stukas on Detling airfield, that will follow shortly after. \n\nIt is time to break the back of Fighter Command! And, eventually, Britain.\n\nThis is a historical day. Good Luck!\n
