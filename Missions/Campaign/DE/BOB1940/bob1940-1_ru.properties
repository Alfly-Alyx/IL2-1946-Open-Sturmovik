Name Bomber Escort
Short A small convoy has been sighted off Dover. Bombers will attack them, and our task is to escort those bombers, see that the enemy fighters cannot stop them.\n
Description July 4, 1940\n\nFollowing the French surrender less than two weeks ago, most of us believed the war was practically over and the British (defeated on the continent and without European allies) would see reason and quickly come to terms with us.\n\nBut there are no signs that the British are giving in - to the contrary. \n\nWell, then we must force them!\n\nThere has been little sense of urgency among our commanders, and among ourselves, when it comes to the task of subduing England. We are all a bit dizzy over all our recent triumphs, I guess, enjoying the warm summer weather and all the pleasures of France. Besides, we have to regain our strength after the Battle for France: victory came at a cost...\n\nYOUR ASSIGNMENT\nA couple of days ago came orders from G\u00F6ring and Luftwaffe HQ. We must prepare for an aerial campaign against England. \n\nThe first phase starts NOW! \n\nThe goal for this first phase is to gain and maintain air superiority over the Channel, and deny the coastal waters to the British cargo shipping that is constantly plying these sea routes with coal and other types of cargo from north to south.\n\nThree days ago the very first attacks took place! Stukas attacked a convoy near Plymouth. Today we will step up our effort. Already the naval base at Portland has been hit by Stukas.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nA small convoy has been sighted off Dover. Stukas and Ju 88's will attack them, and our task is to do a fighter sweep well in front of those bombers, and draw any enemy fighters away from them.\n\nToday your "Kanalkampf" starts! Halz- und Beinbruch!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1. Special thanks goes of course to Canon_UK! Without his map-making skills this campaign would never have been made.\n2.
