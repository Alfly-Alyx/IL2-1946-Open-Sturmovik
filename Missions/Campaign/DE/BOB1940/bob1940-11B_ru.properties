Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description August 16, 1940. \n\n"Adler Tag" was not a complete success. Some bomber units were recalled, other never found their escorts etc, and the targets hit were not knocked out. Also, our celebrated Stuka unit have suffered unexpectedly high losses.\n\nAlso, the heavy "Zerst\u00F6rer" are having unexpected problems. Although the Bf 110 is faster than the Hurricane and almost as fast as the Spitfire, its lack of manoeuvrability and acceleration means that it can't really function as a long-range escort fighter. On 13 and 15 August, 13 and 30 aircraft were lost, the equivalent of an entire Gruppe!\n\nBut our offensive will go on!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nTo draw away the RAF fighters from our bombers, on their way to pound several of their airfields, we will today do a big fighter sweep in the area Margate - Ashdown - Folkestone.\n\nOne of your favourite assignments, eh? You know that twenty downed enemy aircraft means the Ritterkreuz! Good luck!\n
