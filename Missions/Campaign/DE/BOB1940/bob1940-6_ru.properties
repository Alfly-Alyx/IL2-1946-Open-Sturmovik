Name Fighter Sweep
Short Another "Freie Jagd" - your favourite task - over the Kanal. This time you are about to patrol the area south of Folkestone. Attack all enemy Fighters that you can see.\n
Description July 19, 1940.\n\nThe Kanalkampf continues, unabated.\n\nAbteilung V, commanded by Oberstleutnant "Beppo" Schmid, has produced a report on the RAF and on Britain's defensive capabilities. Read it! \n\nThere is one problem: it doesn't mention the British fighter control system, which seems to be very, very good, with the "Indianer" almost always being on the right spot in the right time.\n\nWe know through intercepted radio transmissions the RAF fighters are being controlled from ground facilities, and that there also is some completely new radio system fully operational, not used for transmissions of meassages, but for some other purpose - you have seen the gigantic antenna array at Dover, haven't you?\n\nIt is somehow linked to the control system, but how we don't know yet. Strange.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAnother "Freie Jagd" - your favourite task - over the Kanal. This time you are about to patrol the area south of Folkestone. Attack all enemy Fighters that you can see.\n\nAs mentioned before Intel is already stating the British have problems, not with planes, not yet anyway, but with PILOTS. There is simply not enough of them. \n\nGood Luck!\n
