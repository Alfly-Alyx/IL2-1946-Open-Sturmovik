Name Fighter Sweep
Short This is not a escort mission, but another "Freie Jagd" - Free Hunting. You will do a Fighter sweep over the area between Dover and Folkstone, and hopefully the Britishers will rise to the occasion. \n
Description July 11, 1940.\n\nThe fighting over the Kanal continues. The weather hasn't been too good. Much rain and low clouds. A pretty bad summer, I must say.\n\nSomething about the British tactics: as you have seen RAF fighter pilots fly in vee-shaped sections of three. These restrict squadrons to tight 12 aircraft formations composed of four sections in another tight "V". With this formation, only the squadron leader at the front is free to actually watch for the enemy; the other pilots have to concentrate on keeping station.\n\nSome of our pilots talked about the RAF formations as Idiotenreihen ("rows of idiots") because they leave squadrons vulnerable to attack.\n\nOur system of the four aircraft "Schwarm" is much better. We will surely win this. As well.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis is not a escort mission, but another "Freie Jagd" - Free Hunting. You will do a Fighter sweep over the area between Dover and Folkstone, and hopefully the Britishers will rise to the occasion. \n\nBefore we move in, we will form up properly this time, and fly in one wave, ok?\n\nLater Stukas, escorted by Bf110's, will strike at a convoy that we know is coming up through the straits. We want to make way for these guys, ok? This is our usual brand of tactics: sweeps are better than close escort.\n\nGood luck!\n\n
