Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description August 30, 1940. \n\nOn the night of August 24, some areas in London were bombed, one release hitting central parts of the city. It appears to have been a mistake, done by a group of Heinkel He 111s, unable to find their target, releasing their bombs and returning home, unaware they were dropping them on the city.\n\nIn retaliation, the RAF bombed Berlin four nights ago, quite deliberately! Everyone is furious over this, not least, have we been told, the F\u00FChrer himself.\n\nWhat will come of this we don't know, but we will keep up the pressure on the enemy, attacking their airfields again and again! \n\nBetween you and me I have to tell you that our own losses have been bad: serviceability rates are running at 75% with Bf 109s, 70% with bombers and 65% with Bf 110s. All units are well below established strength. \n\nThe attrition is beginning to tell, particularly among us fighters. But we will stick it out, because our Intel is telling us that Fighter Command is on the brink of collapse. \n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday a detachment of Bf 110's from Erprobungsgruppe 210 will perform another precision raid, this time against Manston airfield.\n\nYour task is to escort them, and shield them from enemy interceptors. Good luck!\n\n
