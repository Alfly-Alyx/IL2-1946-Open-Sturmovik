Description August 8, 1940. \n\nWe have moved to a new airfield just outside Calais, much closer to the coast. There is evidence of a big buildup everywhere. And on this airfield there is a new outfit equipped with both Bf109's and Bf110's, called Erbrobungsgruppe 210. Not to mention all bomber units...\n\nNo, something really BIG is in the works! It can only be a matter of days before the big assault on Britain proper starts. If only this bad weather would clear up.\n\nRegarding our aircraft and the ones used by the Engl\u00E4nders: our Bf 109E is superior to the Hurricane; it has a better climb rate and is faster. The performance of the British Spitfire over Dunkirk came as a surprise to us, although we still believe that the 109 is the superior fighter.\n\nYou have to be aware of that the Bf 109E has a larger turning circle than either the Hurricane or the Spitfire. Both British fighters are equipped with eight Browning 303 machine guns, while the Bf 109E has two machine guns and two 20mm wing cannons, a clear advantage with us. Don't waste the cannon ammo, though: you only have some 60 rounds!\n\nIn truth the differences between the Spitfire and the Me 109 in performance and handling is only marginal, and in a combat they are almost always surmounted by tactical considerations: pilot skill, altitude, numbers, amount of fuel remaining, etc.\n\nEnough on that. Now let's get down to business.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWould you believe that the Brits are still trying to push convoys through the Channel, despite our pounding! Early this morning another British convoy was spotted - it has the codename "Peewit". Elements from Luftflotte 3 are attacking it as we speak.\n\nIn order to draw enemy fighters away from the Luftflotte 3 effort against that convoy, we are doing a big Fighter sweep over the area Margate - Dover - Folkestone.\n\nYour Staffel will participate in that sweep. Good luck!\n\n
