Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description September 15, 1940. \n\nThis is our third big daylight raid on London since September 7. \n\nI'm sad to say that none of them was the success we anticipated. Our first major raid on Londin, on 7 September, involved nearly four hundred bombers and more than six hundred fighters (you of course only saw a small part of this). We targeted docks in the East End of London, and RAF rose to meet us, in greater numbers than we expected.\n\nFighter Command seem to have more life in them than we expected. Strange.\n\nWe still hope to deliver a real knock-out blow to London, although many have started to have doubts.\n\nTo be honest, morale has begun to suffer, and that special combat fatigue called Kanalkrankheit has begun to appear among our pilots. \n\nOur replacement problem are even worse than the British. Though the Luftwaffe maintain its numerical superiority, the slow appearance of replacement aircraft and pilots put increasing strain on the resources of us remaining attackers. As of yesterday our Bf 109 units possess only 67 percent of their operational crews against authorized aircraft. For Bf 110 units it is even worse: 46 percent; and for bombers it is 59 percent. If this is a war of attrition, who is winning it?\n\nPerhaps it was a mistake to start attacking London?\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAgain big numbers of bombers will attack London. And again you will fly detached escort, i.e. patrol a bit in front of the bombers units and shield them from enemy interceptors.\n\nBut take care, and watch your fuel gagues! \n\nGood luck!\n\n
