Name Bomber Escort
Short No "Freie Jagd" today, I'm afraid. But a straight-forward escort mission. A bomber unit is going to attack Dover, and we are to provide cover for them.\n
Description July 28, 1940.\n\nThere has been a lot of bad weather lately, rain just pouring from the sky, but now it's finally clearing up.\n\nWe wiped out an entire British Squadron, on July 19th. Intel says it was the 141st, just down from Scotland and pretty inexperienced. Like shooting fish in a barrel! \n\nBut those aircraft! You have heard of them before: they are called "Defiants", and the only thing they defy is reason - luckily for us. That must surely one of the dumbest ideas around - even sillier than the famous "Heavy Fighter"-concept that the Bf110-boys still swear to: giving a single-engined Fighter just a MG turret and no forward firing guns.\n\nAnd you saw the result south of Folkestone: massacre! Hadn't it been for those Hurricanes coming to the rescue surely not a single Defiant would have survived. Congratulations! You did very nice job.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nNo "Freie Jagd" today, I'm afraid. \n\nBut a straight-forward escort mission, that feels a bit like it. A bomber unit is going to attack Dover, and we are to provide detached escort for them. (It could have been worse, it could have been "close escort", that assignment we all hate.)\n\nGood Luck!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nAs you noticed, in the last mission the role of Defiants had to be filled with Su-2:s, as there are no Boulton Paul Defiants in IL-2 - not yet anyway, but you can never tell what the modding community can do!\n
