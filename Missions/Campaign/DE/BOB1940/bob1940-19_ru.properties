Name Fighter Sweep
Short In order to draw enemy fighters away from the Luftflotte 3 effort against a new British convoy going through the Channel, we are doing a big Fighter sweep over the area Margate - Dover - Folkestone.\n\nYour Staffel will participate in that sweep. Good luck!\n
Description October 3, 1940. \n\nStrategy has indeed changed. Every night between 100 and 200 bombers attack London. And during daytime we have the mission to extend and exhaust Fighter Command by staging fast hit-and-run mission over the coastal areas.\n\nFor this we have been given a new variant of our trusted Bf 109 "Emil". This new fighter-bomber type is called the E-4/B, has a DB 601Aa engine, and is capable of carrying either a one 250 kg bomb or four 50 kg on a special bomb rack.\n\nMany of the older hands and commanders thinks that this is a mistake, a misuse of resources. We are fighters and hunters, not bombers! Also the actual effect cannot be other than marginal: dropping a bomb here and there - what good can that make?\n\nStill, when the bombs have been dropped, the aircraft can function as a fully capable fighter!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe are doing a sweep towards Dover and Folkstone, but before reaching Folkstone, you will peel off, and hit Hawkinge airfield.\n\nOnly your Schwarm will carry bombs. The others fly their usual "Emils", and will escort you.\n\nGood luck - and stop grumbling!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nIf you want to fly in the same camo as the other planes in your "schwarm", switch to skin "BOB_12_ 1940 E4.bmp" by Canon_UK.\n\n
