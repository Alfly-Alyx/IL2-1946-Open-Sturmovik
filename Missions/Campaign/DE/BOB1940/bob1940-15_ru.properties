Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description September 1, 1940. \n\nThe last week we have concentrated all our strength on knocking out Fighter Command and made repeated attacks on their airfields. The key RAF sector stations have been hit repeatedly: Biggin Hill and Hornchurch four times each, Debden and North Weald twice each. Croydon, Gravesend, Rochford, Hawkinge and Manston have also been attacked in strength.\n\nWe think we have Fighter Command on the verge of breakdown now!\n\nBut I must mention this: the RAF has the advantage of fighting over home territory. Pilots who bail out of their downed aircraft can be back at their airfields within hours. For our aircrews, to bail out over England means capture, while parachuting into the English Channel often means drowning or death from exposure. \n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday we will once again attack the big RAF airfield at Biggin Hill. (It will soon be completely knocked out.) You will give them close escort, and protect them from prowling Hurricanes and Spitfuers!\n
