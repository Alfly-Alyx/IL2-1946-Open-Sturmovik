Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description August 12, 1940. \n\nMore bad weather, more delays.\n\nNow we know: the big air offensive to break the back of Britain is about to start any day now. We are just waiting for good weather.\n\nBetween you and me: it was actually slated to go in for two days ago, on August 10, but the torrential rainfall stopped that - for now. You have seen parts of the runway: it's a quagmire!\n\nLet me read to you from the F\u00FChrers War Directive No. 17, issued ten days ago:\n\n"The Luftwaffe is to overpower the British Air Force with all the strength at its command and in the shortest possible time. The attacks are to be directed primarily against flying units, their ground installations, and their supply organisations."\n\nSo there!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe first probing attacks will take place today, despite the weather. The guys in that specialist fighter-bomber unit that we are sharing airfield with, Erprobungsgruppe 210, will attack four of those mysterious radio stations (you know, the ones with those massive aerials) which actually seems to be used to spot our aircraft from afar. \n\nAs on August the 8th, you will participate in a Fighter Sweep, going in first, and designed to draw off the British Fighters. \n\nThen aircraft from the Erbrobungsgruppe will follow, four against each radio station, with pinpoint precision, using Bf110's or a new variant of our Bf109, designed to carry quite hefty bombs.\n\nGood Luck!\n
