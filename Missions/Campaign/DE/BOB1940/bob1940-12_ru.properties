Name Day of the Eagle
Short Adlertag will open with a series of bombing attacks against British coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, among them Lympne and Hawkinge outside of Folkestone, and Manston south of Margate.\n\nYour task is to randez-vous with one of these big bomber forces out over the channel, and then escort them to and back from their target.\n\nThe British will surely send Fighters against you. That's good: shoot down as many as possible.\n
Description August 18, 1940. \n\nI have a bit of bad news. A couple of days ago Luftflotte 5 attacked the north of England. Believing Fighter Command strength to be concentrated in the south, raiding forces from Denmark and Norway ran into unexpectedly strong resistance. Inadequately escorted by Bf 110s, bombers were shot down in large numbers. \n\nIt seems that we might have underestimated the British a bit.\n\nBut we will not give in! The last days we have bombed most of the enemy airfields and important communications centres. Action has been at a furious pace. After a short breather yesterday (when several high ranking officers were called to a meeting with G\u00F6ring himself) we are to attack again.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe task today is to perform another Free Hunt, now in the area around Hastings. The aim to sweep the skies free for a big Stuka attack that will knock out one of those mysterious big radio stations at the coast.\n\nGood hunting!\n\n
