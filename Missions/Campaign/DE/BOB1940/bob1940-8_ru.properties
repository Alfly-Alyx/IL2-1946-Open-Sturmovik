Name Helping a Brother in distress
Short This morning one of our Staffel Commanders was shot down in the Kanal, south of Folkestone. He was seen parachuting down in the sea, and later shooting starburst flares - so he obviously survived the descent. \n\nOur comrades in the Seenotdienst are very efficient, and they have a fair chance of picking him up.\n\nIf they get the chance, that is.\n\nSo, take a wingman, and fly to the location where he was last seen, see if you can spot them. Then provide cover for the sea rescue guys. Remember: you are doing this for one of your brothers in arms.\n
Description July 30, 1940.\n\nWell, that last escort mission wasn't too successful was it? When the bombers saw all those Spitfires swarming down they simply turned back, and we had a hell of a time of shielding their hasty retreat.\n\nStrategically speaking, we seem to have won the Battle of the Channel! The British shipping up and down the straits seems to have been more or less suspended. There's a bit of a lull now. Will the next phase follow soon? \n\nAnyway: more and more Luftwaffe units are arriving here in France, and rumors have it that a big number of Army dividions are being concentrated at the coast. The question seems to be not IF we will invade, but WHEN. \n\nWe are all very, very excited! After this mission, I'll buy drinks for everybody in the Officers Mess!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis morning one of our Staffel Commanders was shot down in the Kanal, south of Folkestone. He was seen parachuting down in the sea, and later shooting starburst flares - so he obviously survived the descent. (As you know, our aircraft are equipped with life rafts and pilots are provided with sachets of a chemical called fluorescein which, on reacting with water, creates a large, easy-to-see, bright green patch.)\n\nOur comrades in the Seenotdienst are very efficient, and they have a fair chance of picking him up.\n\nIf they get the chance, that is.\n\nFirstly: the Channel is very cold, even in summer, and if he didn't get into his little raft he may very well die of exposure in 3-4 hours.\n\nSecondly: the Britishers, with all their talk of fair play, have started to attack all our rescue planes on sight, even though the previously were painted white with big red crosses - now they are painted in camo, and equipped with MG's.\n\nSo, take a wingman, and fly to the location where he was last seen, see if you can spot them. Then provide cover for the sea rescue guys. Remember: you are doing this for one of your brothers in arms.\n
