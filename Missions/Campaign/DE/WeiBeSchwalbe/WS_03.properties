Short Your 1st real test. Get the British Reconnaissance Aircraft\n
Description Date: November 4th, 1944\nTime: 1044 Hours\nWeather: Good with clouds at 1100 meters\nLocation: Brandenburg-Briest\n\nGuten Morgen...\n\nThis is the last day we will be operating from the Berlin area as the group has been ordered to move further north. The Reichsmarshall feels that we are not effectively defending the area and we could be better utilized on the approach routes the American "Diken Autos" must use to reach their targets here in the Reich.\n\nBefore you make preparations to leave, we have another task for you. Reports are coming through from Division Area Headquarters that an Allied Reconnaissance aircraft is now entering sector "Caesar-Anton" at a height of 8000 meters.\n\nMost of our efforts to catch these intruders have been fruitless as our fighters are unable to reach the height and speed we need to catch them.... until now that is!!!!\n\nGo easy on your engines as it will be a long hard climb to catch him....\n\nGood luck!\n\n
