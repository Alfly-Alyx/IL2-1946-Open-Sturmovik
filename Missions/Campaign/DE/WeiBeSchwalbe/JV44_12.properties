Name JV44 ~ Mission 12
Short Galland's Last Stand\n
Description Date: April 26, 1945\nTime: 1300 Hours\nWeather: Scattered clouds at 1200 meters\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nI have some bad news for all of you today. I must inform you that the American and Russian armies joined together at the Elbe River yesterday and have effectively split Germany in half. We are now cut off from Berlin, but we will continue to operate as before.\n\nToday I will lead a mission to intercept the American bombers that continue to attack targets to our northeast near Munich. We will all be armed with R4m rockets and cannons. I expect all of you to press your attacks as close as possible and do not return to base with ammunition left in your cannons! That is all... Dismissed!\n\n
