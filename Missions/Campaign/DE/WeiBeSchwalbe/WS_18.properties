Name Diken Autos
Short Destroy the American "Fat Cars"\n
Description Date: February 9th, 1945\nTime: 1310 Hours\nWeather: Good visibility with scattered clouds at 1300 meters\nLocation: Hespe\n\nWe have just received reports from Division Area Headquarters that the Freya radar stations have picked up American Flying Fortresses heading towards Sector "Friedrich-Paula".\n\nGet your Schwalbes airborne and catch these "Diken Autos". They are currently flying at about 7000 meters so you should initiate your attack from 8000 meters altitude or higher.\n\nAfter takeoff set a heading of 336 degrees for the intercept. We have managed to get a few racks of the new experimental R4M rockets mounted on your jets as well, so fire these as you get near the bomber formations to break them up.\n\nI don't want any of you to put too much weight into this, but "The Fat One" has just sent an official communique stating that any pilots who return with ammunition left in their aircraft and no damage from enemy fire will be put on trial for cowardice and sent to an infantry unit on the eastern front! I am personally aware of how difficult it is for you to dive through the fighter cover and into the face of 50 machine guns, so I will not allow that to happen. Just do the best you can, and good luck up there!\n\n
