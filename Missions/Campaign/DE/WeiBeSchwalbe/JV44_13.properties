Name JV44 ~ Mission 13
Short The Final Blow\n
Description Date: April 27, 1945\nTime: 1000 Hours\nWeather: Scattered clouds at 1000 meters\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nGentlemen... Generalleutnant Galland was wounded yesterday during his attack on the American bombers when a fighter jumped him after his attack run. He survived an emergency landing right in the middle of the attack on our airfield, but he has been sent to the hospital to treat the schrapnel wounds in his leg. Therefore I, Oberstleutnant Heinz Bar, will lead you into battle until further notice.\n\nThis morning, we will take off and circle the field to wait for the American Jabos to return. Our Freya radar is still intermittenly functional and they have warned us of probable low level aircraft heading in our direction.\n\nWhen you complete this patrol, you must land and taxi directly into town to park your aircraft near the command post and reports today's action. If you do not taxi to the dispersal area, no one will drive out to the field and pick you up this time! \n\nGood Luck & Good Hunting!\n
