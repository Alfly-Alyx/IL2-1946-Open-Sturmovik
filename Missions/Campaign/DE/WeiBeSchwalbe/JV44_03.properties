Name JV44 ~ Mission 3
Short Catch the Jabos\n
Description Date: April 6, 1945\nTime: 1100 Hours\nWeather: Good with Clouds at 1000 meters\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nYou will take off this morning on a Frie Jagd fighter patrol. The Freya Radar located here just to the north of the field has noticed sporadic low level activity which we believe to be more enemy "Jabo" raids. Their fighter-bombers have been attacking our airfields at will for the last week and we can not continue to hide our own fighters in the trees while they fly overhead unhindered! The decoy aircraft we have placed on the ramp should prevent them from locating our dispersed jets, but we must not rely on that alone. They will eventually realize that they are fakes if their gun cameras are as good as we think they are.\n\nHurry and get your Ketten of 3 jets airborne before the enemy fighters arrive and do what you can to prevent any more damage to our airfield.\n\n
