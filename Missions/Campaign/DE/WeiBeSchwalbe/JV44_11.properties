Name JV44 ~ Mission 11
Short Base Defense\n
Description Date: April 25, 1945\nTime: 0800 Hours\nWeather: Hazy with scattered clouds\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nThis morning's mission is a Frie Jagd to protect our airfield from enemy fighters. The weather is clearing a bit so we would not be surprised to see roving bands of American Jabos looking for targets. They have started sending out large groups of heavily armed fighters well in advance of their bomber raids solely to attack our fighters before they can be launched. I assure you all that we will be ready for them when they get here today!\n\nAfter takeoff, climb to 4000 meters and circle back towards the airfield here. Stay in the vicinity of our field to watch for the enemy raiding flights as long as your fuel allows, and if we are under attack when it becomes necessary to land, you should divert to one of the smaller satellite fields.\n\n
