Name JV44 ~ Mission 5
Short A Thumb in the Dike\n
Description Date: April 16, 1945\nTime: 1500 Hours\nWeather: Hazy with Clouds at 1500 meters\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nIt was interesting to find out on our last sortie that the R4M rockets are so effective. With a blast like that, it is almost impossible to miss. This gives us great potential for breaking up the American bomber formations. It is unfortunate that we did not have these weapons earlier or the Allies would not have been able to continue their daylight raids that have caused so much destruction to our cities.\n\nToday you will be armed with rockets as well. The radar station has reported a large group of enemy bombers heading our way from the southwest, so we will send up a Kette of three jets to meet them. \n\nThe Diken Autos are reported cruising at 3000 meters so you should try to get above them before initiating your attack. Keep your speed up and it will be very difficult for the enemy gunners to judge the range. Use your rockets on the first pass and you may seperate their flights to minimize the return fire.\n\nGood luck and good hunting! \n
