Short Take your White Swallow aloft and do a test flight.\n
Description Date: December 9th, 1944\nTime: 1427 Hours\nWeather: Blind with low clouds at 900 meters\nLocation: Hespe\n\nWe need you to take a 262 up for a test flight. After the air battle a few days ago, our number of servicable aircraft is depleted is a "dud" that's just been given new engines after an overhaul. We need every aircraft we can get right now, so the mechanics have salvaged what they could from the damaged ones and managed to get this one running again.\n\nJust take her up for a quick test flight around the local area and give her a good going over to see that all systems are operational and that she'll be flyable for the next scramble. Be careful though, as the enemy is always around. Keep your eyes peeled - We've only just got her up and running!\n\nMake your departure quick, as the weather is starting to close in... we should see you back here shortly.\n
