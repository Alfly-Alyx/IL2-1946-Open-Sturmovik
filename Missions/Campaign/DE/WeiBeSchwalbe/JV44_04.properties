Name JV44 ~ Mission 4
Short Get The Diken Autos\n
Description Date: April 10, 1945\nTime: 1500 Hours\nWeather: Low Clouds at 500 meters\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nI have some good news for you today. We have fitted the new experimental R4M 5cm explosive rockets to your Jet fighters. You should be able to release your rockets at about 1000 meters distance while you are still out of range of the defensive fire from the bombers. All 24 of the rockets you carry will launch at the same time to provide a cone of fire about 15 by 30 meters. When you fire into the "Diken Autos" you should destroy one or more immediately. If you can break up the formation, then you can pick off the stragglers one by one with your cannons.\n\nWe are eagerly awaiting the results of today's operational test of our new weapon system and the Freya radar station has reported a flight of enemy bombers heading our way. Today you will launch a full Schwarm to intercept them. Watch out for your Katschmarek and keep an eye out for enemy fighters as well!\n\n\n  * Select skin Me262_JV44.bmp *\n
