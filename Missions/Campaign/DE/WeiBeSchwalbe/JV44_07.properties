Name JV44 ~ Mission 7
Short The "Grosse Gewehr"\n
Description Date: April 19, 1945\nTime: 1430 Hours\nWeather: Good visibility with clouds at 1300 meters\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nAs most of you already know, "Maki" Steinhoff was badly burned yesterday when his fighter crashed on take-off. He has been taken to the hospital, but we do not expect to have him back in the near future. This is an unpleasant reminder to all of us to watch out for the filled in craters on the runway, as this is most likely the cause of his crash.\n\nThe famous night fighter Experten, Major Willi Hegert has brought in a new aircraft for us to utilize, and one of you lucky ones will get to fly it today. It is armed with a 50mm Mauser cannon in the nose and should be quite effective in disabling the American bombers. The only disadvantage is that the single cannon is not well suited to dogfighting so I would suggest you make your run against the bombers and withdraw quickly before the fighter cover can catch you. We have lost many of our fighters due to the constant bombing of the airfield and we must use everything we have to stop the destruction of The Fatherland.\n\nYou will take up 3 jet fighters with the rocket armed 1As in the lead. If the first ones to attack can break up the formation, it will be easier for the "Grosse Gewehr" to pick off the stragglers.\n\n * Load skin Me262U4_JV44.bmp *\n
