Name JV44 ~ Mission 2
Short On Our Own\n
Description Date: April 4, 1945\nTime: 1400 Hours\nWeather: Hazy with Clouds at 1500 meters\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nTake off with a Kette of Jet Fighters and patrol the area to the west in search of enemy aircraft.\n\nAmerican Gabelschwanz Teufels have been strafing and harassing our fuel supply trains and if they are allowed to continue, we will have no fuel to fly.\n\nWe have arranged for a flight of FW 190Ds to cover your takeoff and landing from higher altitude so you will not be quite so vulnerable to enemy attack during these periods of your flight. The enemy is well aware that you cannot accelerate quickly and that it takes quite a while to slow down your aircraft for landing. The "Papagei Staffel" is painted in a bright red and white striped pattern on their undersurfaces so they should be easy for you and our Flak gunners to identify.\n\n  * Select skin Me262_JV44.bmp *\n
