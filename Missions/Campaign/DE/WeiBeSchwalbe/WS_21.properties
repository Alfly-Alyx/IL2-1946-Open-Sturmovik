Short Get your White Swallow aloft now!!!!\n
Description Date: March 10th/11th, 1945\nTime: 2333 Hours\nWeather: Good visibility with clouds at 1400 meters\nLocation: Hespe\n\nWe have just recieved a report of a group of twin engine "Mosquito" fighters entering Sector "Friedrich-Paula". All our other Nightfighters are engaged in other sectors so you'll have to go and do the job yourself.\n\nThe enemy aircraft are flying at about 5600 meters, so you should get above them where you can see the silhouette of their planes against the clouds. You will need to fly on a heading of 335 degrees for an intercept.\n\nOnce again, on the way home you will see two searchlights to help guide you to home base.\n\nGood luck and good hunting.\n\n **Select Skin Me262_Nacht**\n            Markings off\n\n
