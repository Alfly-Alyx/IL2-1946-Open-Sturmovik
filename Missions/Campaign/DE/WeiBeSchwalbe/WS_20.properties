Name Nacht Schwalbe
Short Stop the Drop\n
Description Date: March 7th, 1945\nTime: 0041 Hours\nWeather: Rain & lightning with cloud base at 500 meters\n\nLocation: Hespe\n\nGuten Morgen... time to wake up!\n\nReports are coming through from Division Area Headquarters that a slow moving aircraft is entering Sector "Karl-Lilo". Our best guess is that it is a supply drop of some kind, probably for the partisans in that area.\n\nThey are flying low down at around a 1000 or 1500 meters, but you will have trouble finding him in this weather. After takeoff, maintain a heading of 032 degrees for the intercept and the radar station will try to vector you in by radio.\n\nDon't forget to keep an eye on fuel and conserve your ammunition. Only fire when you KNOW you can get a hit and be easy on the throttles. If you are overtaking the slow moving transport too fast, you will be more likely to ram him than shoot him! The weather is bad and you may need all the ammunition you have.\n\nOn the way home you will see two  searchlights lit up to help you see home base again.\n\n **Select  Skin Me262_Nacht**\n                   Markings off\n
