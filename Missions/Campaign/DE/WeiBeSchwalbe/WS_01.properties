Name Jet Fighter Training
Short Check out ride in the Me262 jet fighter\n
Description \nDate: October 24th, 1944\nTime: 1000 Hours\nLocation: Achmer\n\nWelcome to Erganzungs Kamfgeschwader 2.\n\nYou have had sufficient time to study the manual on the Messerschmitt twin jet fighter, so it is time for your checkout flight. We do not have any 2 seat trainer versions as they have all been deployed as night fighters, so your first flight will be solo. You will take off and circle the airfield and then return to land.\n\nTakeoff procedure is as follows;\nYou will be lined up on the runway by the tow tractor. Set trim to 3 degrees nose up and flaps at 20 degrees. Start engine #1 with throttle at 0%, Wait for rpms to stabilize and then start engine #2. Select both engines and advance throttles SLOWLY to 7000 rpm. Release brakes and gradually open throttles to 90%.\n\nYou can lift off between 200 and 230 km/h. Retract wheels before 260 km/h is reached and retract flaps before 360 km/h. You should maintain between 7500 & 8000 rpm while cruising. If you overrev the engines, they will catch fire and if you are not cautious with the throttle, the engines will stall.\n\nTo land, throttle back below 5000 rpm and trim up to increase drag. You can lower the landing gear when your speed drops under 350 km/h and trim up to compensate for the increased drag. Reduce speed to 300 km/h and lower landing flaps. Do not let your speed fall under 260 km/h while turning or you may loose control. The Me 262 requires a long shallow glide in from 1000 meters altitude to land safely.\n\nWe have also placed some contaminated jet fuel in a few old rail cars at the location marked on your map if you would like to test fire your guns. It might be a good idea to see what it feels like to fire the quad 3 cm cannons. There is no doubt that you will be doing it quite often, but it would be best to know what to expect as early as possible. \n\nThat is it, good luck and we will see you back here shortly.\n\n
