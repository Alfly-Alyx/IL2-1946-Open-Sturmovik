Short Destroy the High-Flying British Recon Aircraft\n
Description Date: December 3rd, 1944\nTime: 1036 Hours\nWeather: Good with clouds at 1100 meters\nLocation: Hespe\n\nReports are coming through from Division Area Headquarters that a high-flying British Photo-Reconnaissance aircraft is now entering Sector "Dora-Eva".\n\nThe Gabelschwanz Teufel is at an altitude of around 8500 meters. Try your best to make this height, but a little higher would be better for the intercept. Remember the enemy is more agile than you are at that height!!\n\nAgain you'll have to be very careful with the throttle at this altitude or the engines will flame out from oxygen starvation. You know where the emergency airfield is: Grid Reference "R-6" in case you run into trouble.\n\nGood hunting and good luck!\n
