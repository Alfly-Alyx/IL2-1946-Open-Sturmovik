Name The Tempest Temper
Short Stop the British Fighter-Bombers from destroying the train.\n
Description Date: November 30th, 1944\nTime: 1532 Hours\nWeather Zero visibility with clouds at 500 meters\nLocation: Hespe\n\nAttention!\n\nWe have an Emergency Situation on our hands! Reports are coming in that a large group of enemy Jabos are now entering Sector "Anton-Paula" at very low level.\n\nThey are after a train carrying spare Me262 components for our other Gruppe just outside of Augsburg. I know the weather isn't the best for flying, but you'll have to make sure THEY don't get IT!!! I am sure I make myself clear... The Reichsmarschall already thinks we are a bunch of cowardly dogs who would not chase a free bone, and I will not accept failure this time!\n\nReports indicate that they are flying below 1000 meters, in and out of the clouds, so you'll need to be sharp to catch them. Get above them at about 2000 meters and keep your eyes peeled on a heading of 014 and you stand a good chance of spotting them as they run through the clouds.\n\nGood luck and good hunting....\n\n ** Select skin Me262_Winter**\n\n  \n
