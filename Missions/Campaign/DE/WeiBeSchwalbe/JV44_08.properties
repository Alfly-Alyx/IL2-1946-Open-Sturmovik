Name JV44 ~ Mission 8
Short The Return Trip\n
Description Date: April 20, 1945\nTime: 1700 Hours\nWeather: Heavy clouds at 1300 meters\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nA group of American twin engine bombers have been spotted just to the north of our airfield. It is most likely they are aiming for the fuel processing plants to our northeast. They are currently at 4000 meters altitude, but that may change if you can not catch them before they reach their target.\n\nWe will send up all six of our remaining flyable jet fighters and try to catch them. I would recommend making a turn to the west and gaining altitude before heading north. From there, the Freya radar station will try to guide you to intercept them when they come back within range.\n
