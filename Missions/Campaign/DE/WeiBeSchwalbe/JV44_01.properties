Name JV 44 ~ Mission 1
Short Berlin Patrol\n
Description Date: March 25th, 1945\nTime: 1000 Hours\nWeather: Clear with Scattered Clouds at 1000 meters\nLocation: Berlin\n\nGuten Morgen Gentlemen... This will be your first patrol with Jagdverband 44. You are now members of "The Galland Circus" as they are calling us and for those of you who may not know me yet, I am Generalleutnant Adolf Galland. I will not bore you with details of how we all arrived at this end, but it is now your duty to fly and fight until the very last.\n\nThis morning, we will patrol to the East of Berlin as a training exercise and hunt for Russians making strafing attacks against our positions.\n\nA Kette of 3 jet fighters will be led by your Head of Training, Oberst Johannes Steinhoff. Some of you already know Oberst Steinhoff from your days in JG7 together before you all came here with the rest of the outcasts. "Macki" and I are both of the opinion that the high speed of the Schwalbes will make it more practical to fly in groups of 3 instead of the normal Schwarm of 4 aircraft. For those of you who are new to the jet fighter... Good luck, and remember that once you take off and set your cruising speed at 8000 rpm, leave the throttle alone until you are ready to land. No hard turns until you are used to the handling qualities of the jet fighter & be careful not to ram the enemy aircraft!\n\n  * Select skin Me262_JV44.bmp *\n
