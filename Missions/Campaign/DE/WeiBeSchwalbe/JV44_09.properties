Short Relief on the Way\n
Description Date: April 21, 1945\nTime: 1000 Hours\nWeather: Clear with Clouds at 1000 meters\nLocation: Munich-Reim\n\nAs most of you are already aware, we have been selected as the destination for some other jet fighter units that have been forced to withdraw from their previous airfields. I/KG51 arrived earlier this morning with most of a full Staffel, and Major Heinz Bar is flying in with his III/EJG2 from Lechfeld. We expect them to arrive shortly, so you must get take your fighters up to altitude and provide some cover from the Indianers that have been hunting for them.\n\nThe inbound flight will be low on fuel, so they may not be able to retaliate if enemy fighters show up. I expect you all to make sure they are not shot down in the landing pattern. This has been happening much too frequently, and the Americans have learned to take advantage of us when we are low and slow. That is all.\n
