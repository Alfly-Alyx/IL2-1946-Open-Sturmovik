Name Melee
Short American Bombers are heading for our Sea Port\n
Description Date: November 5th, 1944\nTime: 0909 Hours\nWeather: Scattered Cloud at 1300 meters\nLocation: Lager-Lechfeld\n\nReports are coming through from the Freya Radar Station at Division Area Headquarters that a large formation of enemy twin engine bombers are entering Sector "Gustav-Anton" at sea level. It looks like they are heading for our Unterseeboot pens at Libau.....\n.....Stop them before they can do any real damage to the area!!!\n\nThe bombers appear to be unescorted so this should be the opportunity we have been hoping for to hit them hard. If you time your attack correctly, you should find some easy pickings for yourselves out there.\n\nGood luck....\n\n\n  \n
