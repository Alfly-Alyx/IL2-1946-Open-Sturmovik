Short Here they come again!!! \n
Description Date: March 15th, 1945\nTime: 1530 Hours\nWeather: Heavy clouds with base at 1400 meters\nLocation: Hespe\n\nWe have just received an urgent call from our local Freya radar station that a large formation of enemy fighters and Jabos are entering Sector "Gustav-Emil" and heading our way at high speed.\n\nThey are in 2 groups with the fighter-bombers at 1000 meters and the escorts above. This looks like what we have feared throughout the winter.... they have found us again!\n\nIf the enemy is still in the vicinity when you run low on ammunition or fuel and you cannot land back here, put down wherever you can. We are initiating the emergency plan now, so we will also have a temporary landing strip set up with refueling trucks in Sector "O-5". Report back to headquarters with your position after landing, and we will regroup at a new location as soon as possible.\n\nGood luck to all of you, and I hope to see you again soon!  \n\n ** Select Skin Me262_Splinter **\n
