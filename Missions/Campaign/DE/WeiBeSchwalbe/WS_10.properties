Short Catch and destroy the American F-5 Lightning\n
Description Date: November 28th, 1944\nTime: 1400 Hours\nWeather: Good with clouds at 1300 meters\nLocation: Hespe\n\nReports are coming through from Division Area Headquarters that a American Photo-Reconnaissance aircraft of the P-38 Type is entering Sector "Friedrich-Paula".\n\nWe only have one serviceable aircraft at the moment so I want you to get upstairs as quickly as you can.\n\nThe Gabelschwanz Teufel is at about 9000 meters altitude, and this is just at the limit for your aircraft. You will have to be very careful with the throttle at this altitude or you will flame out the engines from oxygen starvation. If you have trouble, there is an emergency airfield in Grid Reference "R-6" that has tools and supplies available to get you running again.\n\nOff you go now, we need to get this guy!\n
