Short Our airfield is about to be attacked.....\n
Description Date: November 5th, 1944\n\nTime: 1522 Hours\nWeather:  Poor with heavy clouds at 1100 meters\nLocation: Lager-Lechfeld\n\nGuten Tag, Herr Experten!\n\nReports are coming through from Division Area Headquarters that a large formation of enemy Fighter-Bombers are entering Sector "Gustav-Dora" and are heading our way.\n\nThey're flying at a height of 1000 meters with escorts above, but you'll see them as soon as you take off.... They are close so you will be lucky to get airborne before they arrive. Make sure you get some altitude and sufficient airspeed before making contact. Leave the Jabos alone and go after the escorts, then the Doras can deal with the rest....\n\nThe Focke-Wulfs are already airborne so that should give you some breathing space. Also if you have trouble landing back here, put your Schwalbe down on any airfield you can find and we will come for you in the Storch. Hurry now....\n\n
