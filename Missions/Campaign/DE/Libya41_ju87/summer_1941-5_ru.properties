Description June 15 1941.\n\nThe British attacks are continuing, and Fort Capuzzo might fall very soon. But despite repeated assaults our heroic defenders from the 15th Panzer still hold the strategic Halfaya Pass!\n\nThere are rumors about a counterattack being prepared, but it's imperative that the Halfaya Pass holds. They must get every available support, not least from the air. And yes, they are calling for the Stukas, the "Flying Artillery"\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis morning we want you to take out a British artillery battery south of Halfaya Pass. Also: strafe any targets of opportunity that you can see. \n\nYou will be provided with Fighter escort on this one as well: this time German 109's. Watch out for enemy fighters. They are using a new type, much deadlier than the Hurricane!\n\nGood luck!\n
