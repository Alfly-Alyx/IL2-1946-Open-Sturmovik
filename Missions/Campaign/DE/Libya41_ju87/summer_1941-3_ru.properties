Description Gazala, North Africa. June 14 1941.\n\nYes, as we suspected: the British has started another counter-offensive. Their main thrust is obviously aimed at the strategic Halfaya Pass, but at the same time they are making a thrust from further inland, moving towards the coast.\n\nThe situation is serious but not critical. Not yet.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe are throwing what we got against the enemys attacking units. Your task is to attack a big artillery battery behind enemy lines, that's plastering our front lines with grenades.\n\nIf you can get down on the deck and take out some enemy ground units, well, that will always be seen as a bonus! \n\nOur fighters will not escort you, but instead perform aggressive fighter sweeps, clearing the air in front of you. It should work. But anyway: look out for roving enemy fighters!\n
