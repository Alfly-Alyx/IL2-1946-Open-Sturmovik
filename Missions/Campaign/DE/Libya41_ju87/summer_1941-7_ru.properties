Description Morning, June 17 1941.\n\nWe are advancing!\n\nOur commander Rommel, who last afternoon personally witnessed several of the armoured engagements out on the western flank, has decided to attempt a full thrust against the enemy out there. \n\nAt 16:00 yesterday he ordered the 15th Panzer Division to leave only minimal elements at its position north of Fort Capuzzo and make all haste to the northern flank of the 5th Light Division which was pressing eastward to Sidi Suleiman and on to Halfaya!\n\nWe hope to completely cut off the majority of the British forces, encircling and then eliminating them!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe British are pulling back, towards the coast, and we want you to bomb and strafe the retreating columns. \n\nAs often before, Italian fighters will provide the escort.\n
