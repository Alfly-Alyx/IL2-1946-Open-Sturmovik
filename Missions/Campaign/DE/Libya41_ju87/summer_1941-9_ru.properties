Description June 18 1941. Dusk.\n\nThe enemy offensive is over, and it has been a stunning victory for the German and Italian arms!\n\nAlthough the big encirclement that our general Rommel played for did not materialise, the British are really beaten now! \n\nLet me mention only this: the British have lost some 100 tanks, either in action or by mechanical breakdown. It is correct that we have lost roughly 50, but we now control the battlefield and are therefore able to recover all disabled vehicles, Allied and Axis alike, for salvage and repair. In the end, our real losses will be minimal - while the Allies won't get any of THEIR tanks back.\n\nIn terms of aircraft, the British have suffered considerably higher losses than the Luftwaffe and the Italian forces. I have not the precise figures available right now, but for every aircraft we have lost, they have lost three!\n\nWith the British forces defeated and with no available reserves, Egypt lies wide open to us. \n\nIt is only our critical supply position - the panzers have exhausted most of their petrol - and the continuing threat in our rear from that damned Tobruk garrison, that prevents us from charging headlong towards Alexandria!\n\nOur unit has been transferred to an airstrip closer to the front, in preparation for the upcoming attacks.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYou are back to the old routine: attacking Allied shipping off the coast. We are trying to starve Tobruk into submission, and it is imperative that no enemy supplies reach that encircled city over the sea! \n\nOur recce aircraft has spotted another Allied convoy, trying to sneak into Tobruk under the cover of darkness. Attack them!\n\nYou will be carrying 500kg bombs on this one. You are free to change the payload, but this bomb will give you the best chance of sinking a Destroyer.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the final mission in this campaign.
