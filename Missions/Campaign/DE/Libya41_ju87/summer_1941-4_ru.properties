Description Gazala, North Africa. Evening, June 14 1941.\n\nThe British are driving deep into our flank, attacking towards Fort Capuzzo and Sollum, obviously trying to encircle the strategic Halfaya Pass, which is heroically defended by one batallion from the 15th Panzer, and some Italian Infantry.\n\nThe situation is serious, but we will soon move against them - have no fear. Rommel surely has some tricks up his sleeve. They don't all him the "Desert Fox" for nothing!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe defenders of the Halfaya pass needs all the support we can give them. \n\nThe British have made a small penetration near the sea, and now they are massing some tanks there in preparation for another assault. Your task is to hit them, and try and knock out as many of them as you can. With a little luck the whole attack can be halted before it has even begun!\n\nBecause of the experience yesterday, you will be provided with a Fighter escort: some Italian fighters!\n\nBut hurry, the light is failing!\n\nGood luck!\n
