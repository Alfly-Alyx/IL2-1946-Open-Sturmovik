Description Gazala, North Africa. Early June 1941.\n\nAs you have just arrived here in Libya, I think I must first brief you and the other newcomers on the general strategic situation.\n\nIn late March, soon after the arrival of our Afrika Korps in Tripoli, our commander General Erwin Rommel, though ordered to remain on the defensive (and against the express advice of our hard pressed allies the Italians) quickly captured the British front line position at El Agheila. \n\nWe then went on an offensive which, by mid-April, has reached as far as Sollum, Egypt. The sole remaining Allied position in Libya is the heavily fortified port of Tobruk, which we have surrounded and placed under siege. The Allied response has until now been restricted primarily to harassment by the RAF.\n\nWe are not ready to resume our offensive, not yet. The reason is logistics. We must first gather enough supplies to do so. I'm afraid we're having big problems getting them safely over the Mediterranean - it's that damned Malta! But just you wait: soon...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYes, our main problems is not the heat or the dust or the flies. Instead it's spelled logistics, logistics and logistics. Once - and when! - they reach us over the Mediterranean then they have to be shipped overland to our front line at the Egyptian border, making a BIG and time-consuming detour around Tobruk.\n\nTobruk must be taken, sooner or later. And we must keep up the pressure on the encircled garrison there.\n\nThis night apparently some Allied ships got through our cordon, among them an oil tanker. Our recce planes have spotted it in Tobruk harbour, where it will soon unload its cargo. We will hit it as soon as the sun goes up.\n\nYour task is to fly there, attack and sink that oil tanker!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nDon't forget to switch skin, if you want to fly in the same camo as your wing men.
