Description Late afternoon, June 17 1941.\n\nThe British are in full retreat!\n\nBut the big encirclement we hoped for will perhaps not materialise.\n\nOur Panzer divisions are pushing vigourosly towards the east, but has run into a hastily formed screen of armour and heavy artillery. They are trying to protect the enemy units that were fighting at Sollum and Halfaya Pass that are retreating, no, fleeing towards the east.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe want you to try and attack a part of this enemy screen, namely some artillery batteries that is causing our advancing panzers a lot of trouble.\n\nBut watch out for enemy fighters! They have been making very aggressive patrols over the front lines all morning. They obviously knows what is at stake!\n\nAs mentioned before: the Tommies are also using a brand new single-engined fighter, more deadly than the old Hurricane. We now think it's an American type, called Tomahawk or something like that. Keep your eyes peeled for that one. It has a very heavy armament.\n\nAs usual, you will be escorted by some Italian fighters, this type Fiat G.50's. (It seems as if our own fighter-jocks thinks that escort duties are a bit below them...)\n\nDue to our losses, you will only be three aircraft on this mission. But you'll manage, eh!\n
