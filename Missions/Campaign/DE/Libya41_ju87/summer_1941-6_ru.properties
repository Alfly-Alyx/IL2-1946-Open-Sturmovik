Description June 15 1941.\n\nThe British attacks are continuing, and Fort Capuzzo has fallen. But our heroic defenders from the 15th Panzer are still holding the strategic Halfaya Pass!\n\nThere will definitely be a counterattack, pretty soon, but in the meantime it's imperative that the Halfaya Pass holds. They must get every available support, not least from the air. \n\nYOUR MISSION\nIn a desperate attempt to break the defenders at Halfaya Pass, the British has let a Destroyer sail close to the beach, and are pounding our positions from the sea. \n\nWe want to you to SINK that damned Destroyer! In order to increase your chances, you will load up with 500kg bombs.\n\nSorry, the air activity is so heavy right now, that you can't get any dedicated escort. But hopefully a Fighter sweep of some bf110's has already cleared a path for you.\n\nGood luck and take care!\n
