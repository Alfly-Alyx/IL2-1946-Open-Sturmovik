Description Gazala, North Africa. Early June 1941.\n\nWell done on attacking that tanker! The more hard pressed the garrison Tobruk becomes the easier it will be to conquer that thorn in our side\n\nABOUT YOUR AIRCRAFT\nI know that you are fully trained on the Junker Ju 87 "Stuka", but I just want to remind you of a few things.\n\nThe Stuka's design includes several innovative features, including automatic pull-up dive brakes under both wings to ensure that the plane recovers from its attack dive even if the pilot faints because of the high acceleration. \n\nAlthough sturdy, accurate, and very effective, the Ju 87 is vulnerable to modern fighter aircraft. Its poor manoeuvrability, speed and defensive armament means that the Stuka requires heavy protection from our own fighters. The Ju 87's flaws became apparent recently, during the Battle of Britain. You have heard all the sad stories. The Stuka units were eventually withdrawn from that campaign after suffering appalling losses.\n\nStill, the Stuka has an enormous potential as a precision ground attack aircraft. The foot sloggers call us "Flying artillery"! But beware of flying unescorted against stiff enemy fighter opposition.\n \nYOUR MISSION\nOur Intel is suspecting that the British is up to something. And our commander Rommel agrees with them. \n\nThe Brits launched a small and failed offensive last month, but we know that they have since received even more reinforcements, both in men and materiel. Perhaps they will try and strike against us before we strike against them?\n\nIn anticipation of this your unit will rebase to a small airstrip at Gambut, closer to the front. \n\nBut in order not to waste petrol you will also load up with bombs and attack Tobruk, on your way to your new, temporary base. The target in Tobruk is the small airfield near the harbour.\n
