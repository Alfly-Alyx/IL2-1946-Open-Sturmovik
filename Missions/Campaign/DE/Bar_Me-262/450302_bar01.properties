Short \n
Description Date: Mar. 3, 1945\nTime: 14:50\nWeather: good\n\nFor some time now the Amercians take continous recon flights over southern Germany from their Italian airbases. The P-38 Gabelschwanzteufel as we call it flies too fast and too high for our piston engine fighters, they can't get to altitude fast enough.\n\nToday we have another radio report of P-38 roaming over Bavaria, maybe a recon with escort, no large group.\nAltitude between 6000 - 7000 meters westwards, right above Munich at this time, thye will swing to a southern course over the lakes again, as they usually do.\n\nYou pick Lt. Haber as wingman and the red 13 gets it's babtism of fire. \n\n*******\nB\u00E4rs flightbook states an Alarmstart without success that day, his first operational mission on the 262. The target is fictious.\n\nskin: Bar Me262A1a\nmarkings off\n\n
