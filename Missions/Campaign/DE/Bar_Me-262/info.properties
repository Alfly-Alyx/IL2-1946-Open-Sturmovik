Description February 45 till the End....\n\nHeinz "Pritzl" B\u00E4r became commander of EJG2, a Me-262 unit with already 205 victories under his belt. Soon he would be the leading ace on the jet. After a two eventful months he ends up as commander of JV44.... \n\nThis campaign recreates all of his successful missions on the jetfighter. A copy of B\u00E4rs original flight book was the source for most of the dates and times, as well as notes in the missions.\n\nB\u00E4r, born in 1913, entered the Luftwaffe as a Ju-52 pilot in 1937 and became a fighter pilot in 39. He saw action on almost all fronts, against allmost all opponents and most of the time he was victorious - and lucky, he was shot down 18 times shimself.\nFrom his time in JG51, the antiauthorian B\u00E4r carried a strong animosity against Gollob, making him by default a candidate for Gallands later Expertenstaffel JV44. Although submitted for the Diamonds, G\u00F6ring refused to give B\u00E4r the award in 1943, he became an outcast in the Luftwaffe like so many of the Experten. After several arguments with JG 77 Commander Oberst Steinhoff and Hermann G\u00F6ring he was transferred to France "for cowardice before the enemy" in the summer of 1943 and demoted to Staffelkapitän. He took over command of an operational training unit, Jagdgruppe Süd.\nDuring 1944 he led II./JG 1 in the Reichsverteidigung, and finally, after "Bodenplatte", where B\u00E4r scored two victories, he became commander of the jet unit EJG2.\n\nB\u00E4rs awards:\n    * Verwundetenabzeichen silver\n    * German Cross in Gold (27 May 1942)\n    * Front Flying Clasp of the Luftwaffe in Gold with Pennant "1000"\n    * Combined Pilots-Observation Badge in Gold with Diamonds\n    * Ehrenpokal der Luftwaffe\n    * "Africa" Cuffband\n    * Eisernes Kreuz 2. and 1.

Schwerter (16. February 1942)\n    * Mentioned two times in the Wehrmachtbericht\n\nHis final score was 221, with 124 western planes, second only to Marseille.\n\nHeinz B\u00E4r died in a civilian aircraft crash in 1957. The first Motorplane built in Germany after the carried the callsign D-EBAR \n\n**start the campaign with the highest rank**\n\n\n\n
