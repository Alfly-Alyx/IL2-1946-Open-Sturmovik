Description Date: Apr. 28, 1945\nTime: 14:20\nweather: haze\n\nThe latest reports indicate that Augsburg fell to the Americans today, only little resistance is left by the Wehrmacht.\n\nNonetheless we have a job to do. The american Jabos are continously strafing ground taggets, troops and civilian, in our backjard. We take off in the direction of Rosenheim, the railways and roads will sure draw some Yanks we can beat up.\n\nBe carefull with the cover at higher altitude, watch your speed. \nAs we suffer from constant fuel shortage, only to FW190 are operational today for Platzschutz.\n\n*****\nB\u00E4r shot down his last P-47 over Bad Aibling during this mission. \n\nskin: Bar Me262A1a\nmarkings off\n
