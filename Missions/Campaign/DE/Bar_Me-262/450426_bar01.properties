Description Date: Apr. 26, 1945\nTime: 13:15\nWeather: good\n\nA lot of jets have now reached Riem. KG51 also arrived and turned most of their planes over to JV44. Galland is supposed to protect the south on his own but servicability is low although a lot of Me-262s are scattered around the airfield.\n\nEJG2 is to dissolve into JV44 also but orders from OKL (if such a thing still exists these days) don't matter much here. This is almost like a pirate operation, almost no communication to Berlin and if so, mostly with confusing or just crazy orders anyway.\n\nHere we take matters into our own hands. An American Marauder raid is nearing Augsburg and Lechfeld. The Yankees are preparing for their final assault on the city. \n\nTwo Kette of 262, one led by B\u00E4r, one by Galland are to counter the attack. So what are you waiting for?\nGet up and westwards. Be carefull on take off, wait until Gallands Kette from the other runway has taken off and watch out for craters on the runways.\nGood hunting.\n\n*******\nOn this day, a large formation of Me-262 from JV44 was involved in an airbattle over Lechfeld. 5 B-26 and one P-47 where shot down. But for a heavy price, Galland was injured by Bomber defence fire and was unable to fly again. B\u00E4r took over command of JV44.\n\nskin: Bar Me262A1a\nmarkings off\n\n\n\n
