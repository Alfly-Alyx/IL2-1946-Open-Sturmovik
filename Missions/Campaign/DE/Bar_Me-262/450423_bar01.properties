Short \n
Description Date: Apr. 23, 1945\nTime: 11:00\nWeather: bad\n\nLechfeld is not safe anymore and since the latest raids also heavily damaged.\nEJG2  is moving out to Riem, where Galland and his JV44 already are. There all the southern German Me-262 forces will be combined.\n\nTwo Ketten will take off at a time. Over Riem, their Platzschutz is covering your landing. We have heavy clouds and no air alarm in the area so you should be safe.\n\nYou know that this only is buying a short time. Riem is also endagered but  being under one roof with the Galland guys - outcast aces,  that  fly the 262 for enjoyment and not becasue they still believe in Endsieg - is not too bad. The General is still fun to be with even in these times, he is finished with Berlin as much as you are..... We are doing our duty for the suffering civilians who know that the only thing between the strafing and bombing Allies and them is us few pilots.\n \nAnd because we enjoy the ride of the valyries, the Me-262, a very special aircraft. Who knows when the flight will come?      \n\nskin: Bar Me262A1a\nmarkings off\n\n\n
