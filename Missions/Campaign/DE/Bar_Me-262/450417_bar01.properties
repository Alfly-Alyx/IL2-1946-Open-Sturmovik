Description Date: Apr. 17, 1945\nTime: 13:30\nWeather: good\n\nTwin engine bombers headed for Augsburg, they have just passed Muenchen and they are headed here. We have enough time to get a kette into the air this time. \nBut we are not sure what their exact target is, maybe the fuel dumps in the woods or  industrial installations, maybe Lechfeld itself.\n\nWatch for the fightercover and try to get to the bombers. A group of 109s is in the air as well but we assume you will be with the bombers sooner so donn't rely on them. We can't bring up much more as fuel for the piston engine fighters  is very short.\n\nGood hunting!\n\n***\nB\u00E4r added a B-26 on this day . Since the B-26 is not available at this point, the B-25 is used as a stand-in.\n\nskin: Bar Me262A1a\nmarkings off\n\n\n
