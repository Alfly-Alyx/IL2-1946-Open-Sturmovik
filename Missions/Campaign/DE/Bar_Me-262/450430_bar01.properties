Description Date: Apr. 30, 1945\nTime: 09:10\nweather: clowdy\n\nYesterday on the Radio:\n"Das Oberkommando der Wehrmacht gibt bekannt...."\nHitler is dead! They made a hero story of it but who knows what is going on in Berlin. The Russians are in the centre of the Reich. It is days, if not hours....\n\nWe are moving out of Riem. The place is bombed to pieces and in danger of being taken now, the Americans are aproaching Muenchen.\n\nYesterday already about 20 planes where moved to Salzburg, today the rest of us follows, about another 25 planes. We try to slip through the Ameriacn patrols, contact is to be avoided for the time of transfer.\nSalzburg is a small airfield, already crowded as it is, since it was left alone by the Allies pretty much and now it is almost a last ressort for the fighters. We do not believe in the "Alpenfestung", the war is over, and I also believe that the transfer will be as well our last flight. \n\nSalzburg maybe suitable for a landing of a Me-262, when done carefully but the strip is too short for operational take off!!\nNonetheless we have the order to transfer there and so we will do.\n\nM\u00E4nner,\nit was a great pleasure, as said - this may be your last flight with the Me-262, so enjoy it, avoid  enemy contact at all cost and be carefull on landing!\nSee you in Salzburg, wegtreten zu den Maschinen.\n\n*****\nJV44 was transfered to Salzburg indeed on the 29th and 30th of April. No further missions where flown. B\u00E4r ordered the mixture control systems from the engines to be removed and hidden. When the Americans aproached Salzburg on May 3rd, the planes of JV44 where destroyed while Galland tried to contact the american Commander for surrender talks. The men willing to leave into the mountains recieved their papers and where relesed. The others, almost all the high officers including Galland, surrendered to the Americans in Salzburg.\n\nThis was the end of a short lived, yet legendary unit and legendary pilots who served in it.\nHeinz "Pritzl" B\u00E4r is confirmed with 16 victories on the Me-262, leading dayfighter ace, second overall only to nightfighter K. Welter.\n\nskin: Bar Me262A1a\nmarkings off\n\n\n
