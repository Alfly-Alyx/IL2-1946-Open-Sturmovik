Description Date: Mar. 24, 1945\nTime: 11:17\nWeather: clear\n\nDicke Autos!\n\nLiberators are attacking  the graeter Muenchen area and the aircraft yards and factories! \n\nTake off immediately and intercept them south of Muenchen. Beware of our own Flak so try to stay clear of the city perimeter.\n\nA second Kette wil take off shortly after you so today we will operate at an unusual strength! But none of our conventional fighters are on the enemy so beware of the Mustangs!\n\nYou will have 109s covering our airfield for takeoff and landing. Call them if you need assistance especially during landing.\n\nGood hunting! \n\n***\nB\u00E4r was in a fight with Liberators and Mustangs this day but did not score. Can you?\n\nattention: you maybe want to end the mission with "esc" when leaving the bombers for home - I have experienced several game crashes during the flight home. Not sure about the issue.\n\nskin: Bar Me262A1a\nmarkings off\n\n\n\n
