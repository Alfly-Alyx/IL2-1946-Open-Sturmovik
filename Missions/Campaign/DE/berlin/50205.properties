Amis have a huge numerical superiority in the overall area of operations, but we can still put enough planes in a given sector to have control over local airspace. Let's surprise the Indians today and put a wall of steel on their way to target.Another raid on this city, apparently. We will scramble to intercept these American sky bandits. Keep on attacking until you run out of ammo and try to avoid the escort fighters, if at all possible!Our troops are suffering from lack of supplies. Enemy air attack is constantly destroying trains, and the traffic jams they create sometimes take days to clear. This has to stop! Today, you will fly patrol over our supply routes shoot down enemy Jabos that pass through the area.\n\nDistance to target: 43 km\nFlight Altitude: 1500 m\n\nYour group:\n\nFw.
