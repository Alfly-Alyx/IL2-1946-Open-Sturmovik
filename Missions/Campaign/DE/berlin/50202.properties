Description Gefr. Lehmann joined the squadron\n\nFebruary 2,1945 1415 hours\nWeather: 0 Visibility, 10/10 clouds at 1000 m\n\nKameraden!\nI don't have to tell you how important each one of you is to our overall war effort. We don't have many planes to spare, and each mission you fly should have as much effect as possible. Today our squadron is sent up to patrol the Eisenhuettenstadt airspace.\nThis airfield has suffered repeated bombing raids recently. We have to try to break up any further bombing attempts. Remember to keep your speed up at all times! No sudden maneuvres, no slowing down for easier aiming! Spray the bomber stream like in the training films you've watched, attack in formation and your combined firepower should bring down some bombers. Good luck!\n\nDistance to target: 70 km\nFlight Altitude: 1500 m\n\nYour group:\n\nFw. Skalff (Me-262) *\nUffz. Lemmle (Me-262)\nFw. Kopf (Me-262)\nGefr. Marx (Me-262)\nLt. Pabst (Me-262)\nGefr.
