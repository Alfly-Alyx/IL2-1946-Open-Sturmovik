Description Great flying! The Allies have paid a high price for bombing our Reich Capital.\n\nDespite all things that are going wrong in this war, you were able to make the difference. At least for one night the people of Berlin will be able to sleep in peace.\n\nThis morning, you will be escorting a Ju52 transporting a delegation of scientists and some new and extremely secret appliances for the nearby radar artillery site.\n\nTake off with your flight and circle on the airfield until the Ju52 has landed.\n\nKeep your eyes open for any intruders and bring them down without mercy.\n\nThe Reichmarschalk himself has promised nothing would happen to those people or the appliances.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Ta152-KG200-winter\nMarkings: ON\n
