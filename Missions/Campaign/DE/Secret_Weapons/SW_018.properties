Description Thanks to the air support, our Kameraden could leave Bourcy without noticeable losses.\n\nWe are moving today to the Merzhausen airfield, but we first have a mission to complete.\n\nThough the weather is far from optimal, the Allied bombing activity has increased.\n\nSome A20 medium bombers, have been recently stationed at the Asth airfield. We are going to pay a visit to their new home. Let's give them a very warm welcome!\n\nTwo flights of Ju88's have joined the Squadron. I'm not sure how long we will be able to keep them, since there are very few left. You will accompany the Junkers with two flights of Bf109Z. You will be carrying bombs as well. Go to Asth, and blow the place to smithereens.\n\nDon't forget to land back at Merzhausen. From today on, the Squadron will be operating from there.\n\nThe transports will leave together with you and will wait for you at the new airfield.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Bf109Z_KG200-winter\nMarkings: ON\n
