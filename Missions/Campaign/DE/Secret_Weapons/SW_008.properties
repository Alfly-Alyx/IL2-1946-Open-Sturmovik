Description The bad weather is keeping most of the Allies planes on the ground, but their tank and artillery divisions have broken through and are now pushing us out of Bastogne.\n\nThey have taken the western part of the city, just across the river, while our Panzer and artillery divisions are holding the eastern industrial area.\n\nTake out the whole Squadron and give the Panzer kameraden some good ground support and destroy the artillery positions near the two northernmost bridges.\n\nSome Bf-109's will provide fighter cover in the area, just in case some crazy Yankee fighters try to stop you.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Do-335A-KG200_winter\nMarkings: ON\n
