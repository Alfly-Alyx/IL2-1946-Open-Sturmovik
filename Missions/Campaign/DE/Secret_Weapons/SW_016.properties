Description A Fi-156 has discovered an advanced Allied field HQ, half hidden in the woods just North of Houffalize.\n\nThe Yanks think they're safe. Let's prove them wrong!\n\nThough the Storch sneaked in gliding, it was not able to exactly determine the layout of the HQ, but the observer was sure that at least 10 tanks were under camouflaged nets at the edges of the clearing near coordinates 25.2-29.2 in sector D3.\n\nThe Storch pilot will circle in the area as long as he can to guide you, but don't count on it. Those brave airmen are at risk of being shot down as we speak.\n\nWe are sending one flight of Do335 to hit the HQ.\n\nYou will lead the second flight with your Bf109Z armed with bombs, but will drop everything and defend de Dorniers if any Allied fighters show up.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Bf109Z_KG200-winter\nMarkings: ON\n
