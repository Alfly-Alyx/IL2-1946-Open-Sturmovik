Description Not a bad show.\n\nYour plane has been rearmed, refueled and you are going to fly again before night falls.\n\nA large force of enemy tanks has been sighted several miles South-West of the field HQ you attacked this morning. Two Panzer Divisions will block their advance at the bridge near Myedzyrzecz in sector R5.\n\nTwo flights of Do335 are going to attack the tanks.\n\nYour Squadron will provide cover for the bombers.
