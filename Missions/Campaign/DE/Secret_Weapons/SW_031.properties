Short \n
Description It appears you survived.\n\nDon't be so cocky about that, it was a recon plane after all. You will be singing a tone lower once you'll meet real enemy fighters.\n\nThough your 'Schwalbe' (Swallow) is faster and with a good armament, it manoeuvres like a pig, its turbojets tend to go up in flames just like that and a couple of bullets in one of the engines will make you go down like a fireball, if the whole kite doesn't explode under your soft parts first.\n\nI hope you had a good night's rest.\n\nToday you'll be escorting a bunch of Do335's attacking an enemy advanced field HQ.\n\nConcentrate on your escort job. Keep possible enemy fighters from the bombers and come back alive. That's an order!\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Me262A2A-KG200-East\nMarkings: ON\n
