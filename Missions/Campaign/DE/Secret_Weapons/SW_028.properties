Name 028
Short \n
Description Well, despite the fact that your squadron repelled the attacking force, we lost two of the scientists and one of the trucks carrying the new secret parts for the radar.\n\nThe Reichmarschalk has ordered you to Berlin, immediately. He was not actually screaming, but by the tone of his voice, I think you will be flying a desk for the rest of this war.\n\nI feel sorry for you, but at least you are not going in front of the firing squad.\n\nTake one of the Fw190D's and fly to Berlin before the night falls. Report to the Kommandantur at the Gatow airfield.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Fw190D-KG200\nMarkings: ON\n
