Description The Russians have taken Landsberg airfield.\n\nNot even one hour after we left, the enemy tanks rolled in and by the end of the day two fighter, one bomber and two bomber-fighter Squadrons took possession of their new home.\n\nWe think that they might try another surprise attack to Kustrin's docks. The docks are now easily within range of the Russian fighter-bombers.\n\nPatrol the Kustrin's air space with two Schwalbe flights and make any Ivan pay a high price for entering the area.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Me262A2A-KG200-East\nMarkings: ON\n
