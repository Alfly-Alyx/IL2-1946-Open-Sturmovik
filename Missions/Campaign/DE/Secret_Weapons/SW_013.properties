Description The Mistel attack was a huge success, but their employ has been strictly limited to very important strategical targets.\n\nThere is one more mission we have been ordered to carry out in this area: The Rail yard at Bastogne.\n\nThe Allies are packing up loads of materials which they can transfer from Bastogne almost to our Reich's doors. We must teach them another lesson.\n\nTake another Mistel (the last one we got for probably a very long time) and wipe out the rail yard.\n\nThe yard is located between the two industrial sites, near the river-bank, between the bridges.\n\nTwo pairs of Fw190D will patrol West of your return route, just in case.\n\nThe weather is still bad, but you never know with those crazy Yankees....\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: mistel_KG200-winter\nMarkings: ON\n\nNOTE: do NOT use the autopilot, since this will crash the mistel.\n
