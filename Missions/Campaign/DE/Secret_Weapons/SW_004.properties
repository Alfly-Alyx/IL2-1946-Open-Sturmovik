Description Attacking a good defended target like that carrier was not a big success. A recon plane reported that it was not seriously damaged after all.\n\nThe Oberstkommando has prohibited any more of such attacks. On the other hand, we need to let the Allies feel the pressure.\n\nWe know that three submarines have been docked at the facility near Grandcamp-les-Bains for repairs. The docks are very deep into enemy territory. This means that we can strike the Allies where they don't expect it.\n\nAs usual, your first priority is to protect the bombers from enemy fighters.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: FW190D9-KG200\nMarkings: ON\n
