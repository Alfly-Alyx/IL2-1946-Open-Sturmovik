Description Good show, bringing down that B17!\n\nHowever, it's not time to rest yet.\n\nIt seems that that bird was just a scout. The radar battery informed us that a large formation is on its way, probably en route to Berlin.\n\nGet the Squadron in the air and intercept them.\n\nTwo flights of Fw190's will deal with the escorts.\n\nDon't get carried away in some crazy dogfight. Deal with the bombers and leave the escorts to the 190's.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Ta152-KG200-winternight\nMarkings: ON\n
