Name 043
Short \n
Description Ivan is in Berlin.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the war has ended. Rumors go that the Fuhrer has committed suicide together with Fraulein Braun and all his staff, in the bunker under the Reichstag.\n\nYou may still try to save your neck, though.\n\nTake anything with two wings, an engine and some fuel and fly due West. There should be somewhere on this airfield one of the He-100's belonging to the Heinkel Factory Air Defence Squadron from Rostock. They just came in this night. The pilot of number 12 was so badly injuried that he had to leave the plane here.\n\nTry to land somewhere near the American lines, if you are not shot down before you get there.\n\nOr you may also stay here and wait until Ivan comes knocking at your door....\n\nIf I was you, I would take my chances with the Yanks. It seems that they behave quite decently towards high-ranking Luftwaffe Officers.\n\nIt was an honor to serve with you.\n\nHals und beinbruch!\n\nSkin: He-100\nMarkings: OFF\n
