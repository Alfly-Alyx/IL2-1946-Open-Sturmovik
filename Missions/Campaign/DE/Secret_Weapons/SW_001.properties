Name 001
Short \n
Description Your first mission is to make a low-level recon along the Orne river, North of Caen.\n\nIt seems that with our engineers having failed to blow up the 2 bridges during their retreat, the enemy has got a wonderful opportunity to use them for their main transports. We need to destroy the bridge known as Pegasus bridge. It is the one located on the West bank of the Orne.\n\nYou will fly the fastest Fw available so far, the Fw190-D9. Stay low and fast.\n\nApproach from the West to get advantage of the lightfall at sunset and make photo's of the area.\n\nRemember that the bridges are guarded by several AAA positions so do not linger.\n\nMake one pass, take the photos and get the hell out there.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: FW190D9-recon\nMarkings: ON\n
