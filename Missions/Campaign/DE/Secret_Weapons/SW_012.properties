Description When we abandoned Houffalize, our Engineers failed to destroy its main industrial buildings. As a result, the Allies have now in hands a couple of intact heavy factories.\n\nIn a couple of weeks, they could convert them to make spare parts for their plane and vehicle engines.\n\nThe whole area must be completely destroyed!\n\nThere are not enough heavy bombers to carry out such a massive attack, but our scientists have come with a wonderful alternative: "The Mistel".\n\nThis is a modified Ju88 completely packed up with high-power explosives, making it a gigantic flying bomb which can be flown like a normal plane... the only thing is that you will be sitting on the bomb!\n\nDon't worry, you will guide the Mistel by means of a modified Fw190.\n\nFly to Houffalize, dive and release the Mistel on the Industrial centre and get the hell out of there.\n\nBe careful not to fly too close to the target when the Mistel hits, or you and your plane will be blown to pieces.\n\nA couple of Fw190D will cover you on the way back.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nNOTE: Do NOT use the autopilot before releasing the Mistel. It will cause you to crash.\n\nSkin: mistel_KG200-winter\nMarkings: ON\n
