Description Guten Tag, Herr Major.\nIt is an honor to have you as Geschwader Kommodor.\n\nThis Unit (KG200) is, as you may already know, one of the finest Geschwaders in the Luftwaffe. Our task is to test in the field the most advanced planes, the best of the best that our Scientists and Emgineers have developed.\n\nForget all about the "classic" planes you have flown so far. Here you will fly anything news coming just out of the test track.\n\nYour pilots have been chosen amongst the finest flyers we could find, but they lack your extensive tactical and combat experience. This is where you come in. Teach these boys to fly like a man.\n\nThere will be no fixed assignments; one month you may fly dogfigths in France, next one you may find yourself attacking tanks in Russia. Our Geschwader will be where they most need us.Good hunt and... Hals und Beinbruch!\n\n\nNOTES:\nStart the Campaign with the rank of Major.\nAll the planes used by your squadron will be flown using customized skins.\nThe skin to use for the mission is always specified in the briefing.\nUnless otherwise specified, the option "Markings ON" should be applied.
