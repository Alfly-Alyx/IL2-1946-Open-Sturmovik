Description The Me-163 is deadly fast, literally. Two pilots have blown themselves to pieces because they forgot to glide down onto the bombers, and attacked the bombers from above at full throttle... we haven't found a piece bigger than a pfennig.\n\nThere is no time to celebrate your victories.\n\nI hope you were able to catch a quick sleep this afternoon, because tonight you will climb into the "flying wing" for a late dusk patrol.\n\nIvan is very close and already a couple of times they have tried to finish up the job the Yanks left undone during the day.\n\nBe careful: there will be also some Bf-110's night interceptors in the area. They are sometimes too eager to try their "schragemusik" on everything that flies.\n\nYour unusual plane might scare the hell out of them. They have been alerted on your presence and have had several air-recognition briefings, but still...\n\nFor tonight's action, you will take off from Tempelhof and land at Schonefeld.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: G0229-KG200-night\nMarkings: ON\n
