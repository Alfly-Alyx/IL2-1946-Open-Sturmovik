Description The Oberkommando had a surprise for you when they requested you to go to Berlin for a conversion course.\n\nNow you have come back with three He162.\n\nThis is the most advanced fighter available. Its revolutionary turbine engine gives it an unprecedented speed advantage on any enemy fighter.\n\nTake your flight out immediately for a familiarization flight. Try to stay out of troubles for the time being. We don't want unexperienced pilots being shot down in one of these kites, they are far too precious.\n\nA couple of Bf109Z will loiter in the area, just in case.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: He162-KG200-winter\nMarkings: ON\n
