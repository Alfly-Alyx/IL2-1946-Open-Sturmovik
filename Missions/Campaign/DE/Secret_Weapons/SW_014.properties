Description Since the weather is improving, the Allies offensive against the Reich is in full gear.\n\nWe were forced to move back to the Frankfurt airfield.\n\nOur Squadron has received a new lethal weapon, the Messerschmitt Bf109 Zwilling (Twins), or simply Bf109Z. It is equipped with a lethal arrange of cannons, which compensates the diminished agility.\n\nWe are going to test it against ground and air targets. Don't think about pure dogfight, this kite is no nimble Fw190.\n\nThe Allies are starting to probe out borders with swift medium bomber attacks and our Tactical Command thinks that more and more formations of heavy bombers will be sent over the skies of the larger Reich cities.\n\nIf we cannot throw back the enemies or halt them, then at least we will have them bleed.\n\nA tank battle is going on in the Noville sector.\n\nA formation of Yankee A20 bombers has been sighted on their way to provide support. Don't let them reach their target.\n\nA flight of Fw190D will take care of possible enemy fighters.\n\nNow let us show the Yanks our new toys.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Me109Z_KG200-winter\nMarkings: ON\n
