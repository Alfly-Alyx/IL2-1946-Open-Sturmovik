Description Sorry for having you come back to Berlin in the middle of the night, but General Galland has assigned your Squadron to a dangerous task.\n\nYou will be flying the two most secret planes available at the moment: the Me-163 rocket plane and the Go-229 "flying wing". The Me-163 has few limitations, like the short range and the scarcity of fuel. The Go229 is quite large, slower and less manoeuvrable than the Me-163, but it is an effective night interceptor.\n\nYou will be flying from different airfields in and around Berlin. You will be constantly moving among the Tempelhof, Schonefeld, Tegel and Gatow airfields. This is to confuse the enemy. They will never know exactly from which airfield we operate and will not know where to attack when you are on the ground.\n\nThe bomb raids on Berlin have intensified and every day larger formations of Yankee bombers throw tons of bombs on our Capital. At night, the Russians take their place.\n\nWe need to bring down as many bombers as possible.\n\nRight now, the radar reports American bombers heading this way.\n\nTake off from Tegel and bring down as many as you can. Land at Gatow.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Me163-KG200\nMarkings: ON\n
