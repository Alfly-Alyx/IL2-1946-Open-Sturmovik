Description A large formation of Russian heavy bombers has been sighted.\n\nThe recon Storch extrapolated the course and their likely target could be the Kustrin's docks.\n\nThe escort seemed to be light, but don't count on that.\n\nTake out the Squadron, intercept the bombers and bring them down. A flight of Fw190D will take care of the escorts.\n\nYour Schwalben have been armed with rockets to disperse the bombers. Rockets have been already used with success by General Galland's Squadron against large bomber formations.\n\nOnce out of rockets, your cannons will do the rest.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Me262A2A-KG200-East\nMarkings: ON\n
