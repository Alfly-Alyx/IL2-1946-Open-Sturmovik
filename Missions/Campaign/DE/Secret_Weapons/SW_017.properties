Description It is convoy busting day!\n\nArmored columns have been sighted moving between Noville and Bourcy.\n\nThere is no time to load bombs on your planes.\n\nThe advancing vehicles must be stopped before reaching Bourcy. If they arrive there, our Kameraden will not be able to retreat back to our positions and you will have to bear that on your conscience.\n\nTwo flights of Bf109Z should be enough for the job.\n\nYou will have no fighter escort either, so use your planes wisely in case enemy fighters are in the area.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Bf109Z_KG200-winter\nMarkings: ON\n
