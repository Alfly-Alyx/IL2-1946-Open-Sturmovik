Description The Russians are forcing their way deeply into our territory. They have already cossed the pre-war borders and are moving West very fast.\n\nWe need to abandon the airfield.\n\nOn the West front, the Allies are also moving East very quickly.\n\nDon't get too used to your new base. Before we know, we may need to move again.... next stop might be Berlin itself.\n\nThe whole Squadron will leave in two waves.\n\nThe Ju52 transports will leave first and will head directly towards Frankfurt an der Oder, escorted by the Fw190D9's.\n\nThe second wave will be what is left of the Do335 Squadron and the last Me110's we have.\n\nYou will join this wave and will also carry bombs. Head South-East and attack everything with a red star on it, in the air and on the ground, then head to Frankfurt's airfield.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Me262A2A-KG200-East\nMarkings: ON\n
