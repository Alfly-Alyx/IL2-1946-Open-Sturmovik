Description The situation is getting real bad. There is no front anymore, we are fighting on all sides.\n\nIt appears that we have to fight our way back home just to get out of here.\n\nThe weather is still far from good but we need to give the Panzer divisions some support or we won't make it back home at all.\n\nTake out the Squadron and fly to the village of Longvilly.You need to stop the advancing Shermans before they reach the bridge just south of the village. This will give the Panzer the chance to consolidate their position in the village and counter-attack.\n\nWe do not expect much enemy air presence, but a flight of Fw-190's will have the area covered.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Do-335A-winter\nMarkings: ON\n
