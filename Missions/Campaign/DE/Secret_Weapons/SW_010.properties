Orders are to stand to the last man, plane or Panzer.\n\nA recon plane has seen a troops and supply train trying to make its way to Houffalize. Let's show the Yanks we are still able to sting.\n\nIf you can destroy the train before it reaches the station, the city can still be held, since several Panzer tanks are moving right in to reinforce the few men holding the city.\n\nBf-109's will provide escort.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Do-335A-KG200_winter\nMarkings: ON\n
