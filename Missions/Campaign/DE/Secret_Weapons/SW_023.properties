Description \u0020The He162 is being produced in too few numbers and is too lightly armed to make it a good fighter.\n\nWe have been charged to a very important task.\n\nWe are moving to the airfield near Bonn, to provide air defence for a nearby radar-guided air defence battery. The place is right on the route the Allies have to fly to bomb Berlin.\n\nThe last weeks, this battery has downed quite some heavy bombers on their way to Berlin.\n\nNow that most of the Squadrons have been moved within the borders of the Heimat, we will be flying from one of the most advanced outposts.\n\nOnce we get to the new base, we will be equipped with the latest fighter-interceptor: The Ta-152.\n\n For the time being, jump in the first available plane and get moving. Now there's no time to waste. Get in the air and fly to your new home.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Bf109Z-KG200-winter\nMarkings: ON\n
