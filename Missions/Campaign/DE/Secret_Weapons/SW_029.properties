Description The show over the airfield has probably saved your neck.\n\nGeneral Galland was impressed by your skills. He has spoken to the Reichmarschalk and convinced him to assign you to a special unit. Words go that you are likely to get killed in the next weeks while flying the new experimantal planes, so that must have been enough for the Reichmarschalk.\n\nWe are fighting on two fronts.\n\nThe Katyusha's are pushing their way from the East and the Tommies and Yanks from the West.\n\nThe realists among us know that the war will soon be over, but everyone agrees that we will not just sit down and watch how the barbarians invade our Heimat.\n\nYour next task will be to make the advance of the Russian as difficult as possible.\n\nYou'll be flying the new Me262. Beware: this bird is like nothing you have ever flown until now and you have no time to get used to it. Watch out for the flame-outs. Furthermore, the turbine motors have the tendency to overheat and just go up in flames, so watch your dials.\n\nNow pack your gear and fly North-East to your new home: Landsberg.\n\nWegtreten!\n\nSkin: Fw190D9-KG200\nMarkings: ON\n
