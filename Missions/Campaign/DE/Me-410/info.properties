Name Me-410 Hornisse
Description This is a fictitious campaign featuring 2 versions of the Me-410 from the AAA Mod Community, which is a really lovely aircraft, deserving of a campaign.\n\nStarts in Berlin, with 2 training missions, then the Ardennes, made on the tab_ardennes Winter mod map, during winter 44-45 and back in Berlin in 1945, and finishes with a run for the Allies in Belgium in May 1945.\n\n\nI adapted this campaign from a French website (Forget which) version of a Me262 campaign I downloaded last year, but don't know who the author is. As you'll see my interpretations from French leaves a lot to be desired, but I hope you'll enjoy this anyhow.\n\nFeel free to change the weapon selections around to your own liking, as I haven't had time to learn all the variations available as yet, but will in the future, as I love flying this baby, so deadly.\n\nThanks to the guy who did the original Me-262 campaign, tab_flettner, the tab_ardennes Winter map maker, and the skinners from the AAA website, that came with the mod, black13.bmp and 1/KG51.bmp.\n\n Special thanks to the AAA mod makers for all the great mods you've done and are working on for the future.\n\nBegin with Rank of Oberleutnant, or higher.\n
