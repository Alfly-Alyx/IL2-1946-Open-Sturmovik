Short The Reds attack!!!!\n
Description \nOur radio transmissions are not operational any more and we are surprised by the majority of the actions of the enemies.\n\nNow there is a Fi-156 in the neighbourhood making a return to the base, probably it comes to announce the approach of enemy aircraft, probably of Soviets this time around.\nTakeoff, protect its landing and clear the sky of Yaks... \n\nGood Luck!\n\nSelect Skin "Black13.bmp" markings OFF.\n
