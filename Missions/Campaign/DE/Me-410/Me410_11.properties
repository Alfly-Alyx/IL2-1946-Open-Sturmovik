Name Bastogne 
Short \n 
Description \n19th December, 1944.\n\nThe weather conditions are not at all favourable to us, but our troops have need for a Jabo operation near Bastogne.\n\nSo for today, your objective is a gathering of tanks in the North of the city. You will not meet fighters, but do not go down too low: watch speed as you fly, you will probably not be able to see any obstacles, with the visibility as bad as it is, so be careful.\nViel Gluck!\n\nSelect Skin "IKG51.bmp" markings OFF.\n
