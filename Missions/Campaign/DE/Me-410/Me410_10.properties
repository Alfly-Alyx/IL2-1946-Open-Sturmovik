Description \n18th December, 1944.\n\nThe Americans have been completely surprised by our counter-offensive. They are encircled and trapped in Bastogne.\n\nYour mission today is to suppress the AAA before a raid by our bombers, which will follow immediately.\n\nYou will be reinforced by a schwarm of 4 new aircraft that arrived here yesterday.\n\nThe bad weather conditions should make encountering any of their fighters unlikely, but you would be wise to keep some shells so as to be able to engage them if necessary.\n\nViel Gluck!\n\nSelect Skin "IKG51.bmp" markings OFF.\n
