Name  Mission Impossible  
Short Cut down a traitor.\nInterception of Me 163\n 
Description \n\n\tTakeoff Immediately!!!\nOne of our pilots of an Me-163A has quit its' flight plan and heads towards the West. We think that it is an act of desertion. The pilot will deliver the apparatus and his secrets to the Allies. \nIt will pass from the east to the West to the North of Berlin.\n\nThis mission is very difficult. Against your Me-410, the Komet is almost unassailable.\n\nIt is imperative that you have the advantage of altitude.\n\nWith the autopilot, you will not reach that point (over 2000m of difference of altitude, the objective is difficult).\n\nTakeoff 6hO8, cross, direct it to the 90-100, take altitude (4000m) and speed... Point towards your target and... good luck. You will need some!!!!!\n\nSelect Skin "Black13.bmp" markings OFF.\n
