Description I./KG54\n"""""""""""""\n10 May 1942\n"""""""""""""\nTime: 0530 Weather: Misty\n""""""""""""""""""""""""\nArmament: 4 x SC-250\n""""""""""""""""""""""""\n\nOur signals tell us that a Royal Navy destroyer, called "Welshman", has sneaked into Valletta carrying essential spares.  We shall give him a surprise.\n\nThis time we will use stealth.  You will attack as a pair by approaching low in the morning mist.  The enemy will hear you, but not be able to see you.  There will be plenty of fire but not much sting.  Go directly into the mouth of the harbour to avoid the balloons, and follow the main channel, where we believe this ship is located half way down.\n\nDrop your bombs on the ship, then carry on low across the island.  Once you are clear, head for home.\n
