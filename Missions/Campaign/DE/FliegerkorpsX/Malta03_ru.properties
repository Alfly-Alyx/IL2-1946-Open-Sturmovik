Description I./KG54\n"""""""""""""\n20 April 1942\n"""""""""""""\nTime: 1410 Weather: Overcast\n""""""""""""""""""""""""\nArmament: 28 x SC-50\n""""""""""""""""""""""""\n\nWe have received some disturbing news.  This morning the British flew in Spitfires from a carrier located off the Algerian coast.  We believe it is the Americans who have aided them.  Yet these machines are still few, and we figure perhaps not ready for the fight.  Now is the best time to strike them.  For each cunning English move, we must offer a counter.\n\nYou will fly to the target of Luqa airfield at 800 metres, and then dip to 300 metres as you pass over the island.  Spread your bombs over the runway, and especially over the blast pens, where the new aircraft are likely to be sheltered.  If we can put them out of action before they have left the ground, then we will have dealt a severe mental blow.  It will leave only one player left in the game.....\n
