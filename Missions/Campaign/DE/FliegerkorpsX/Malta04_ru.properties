The Spitfires have made their presence felt.  We stay away from them for a while.  This evening you will go to the assistance of an Italian convoy that has just departed from Syracuse.  Already they are being harrassed by British torpedo boats.  We give you a mixed bomb load.  Those fast boats are devils to hit, but do your best, until our S-boats can drive them away.\n
