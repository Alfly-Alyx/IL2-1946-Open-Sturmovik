We are slowly increasing the pressure on the English outpost of Malta.  This imperial pimple in the middle of the Mediterannean is proving most troublesome to our operations in North Africa.  From here, the Britishers can send out planes, boats and submarines to interfere with our supply lines to the African front.\n\nOur gallant Italian allies have tried their best to reduce this garrison by themselves.  Sadly their best has not been good enough, so we are holding the burden.  We have two tasks - to silence Malta as a box of English tricks, and to prepare it for our conquest.\n\nIt may appear that our victory is inevitable, and, in truth, it almost is.  However, you cannot always be sure with the Anglo-Saxon fox.  One of our most vital tasks is to ensure the garrison on the island is not re-supplied.  A convoy is on its way from Alexandria, and last night our friends in the Italian Navy let it through.  We can no longer be sure of their nerve, so we must intervene.  Head to the assigned sector, and send those ships to the bottom.\n
