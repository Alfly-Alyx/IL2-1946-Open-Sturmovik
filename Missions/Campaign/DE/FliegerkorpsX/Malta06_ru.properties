Description I./KG54\n"""""""""""""\n10 May 1942\n"""""""""""""\nTime: 1620 Weather: Overcast\n""""""""""""""""""""""""\nArmament: 2 x SC-1000\n""""""""""""""""""""""""\n\nWe learn that once more the British have reinforced their fleet of Spitfires.  The enemy hangs by a thread and then pulls himself up again.  Very good - now we shall play our hand.\n\nYou will dive-bomb the Takali airfield from 4000 metres.  Once more aim for the blast pens.  The bombs we give you will blow those structures into pieces.  Catch as many of the pestilent Spitfires as you can.  If they cannot fly then they will not confound us.\n
