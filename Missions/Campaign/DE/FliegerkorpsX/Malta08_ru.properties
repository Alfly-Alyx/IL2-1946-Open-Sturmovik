Description I./KG54\n"""""""""""""\n16 June 1942\n"""""""""""""\nTime: 1530 Weather: Overcast\n""""""""""""""""""""""""\nArmament: 4 x SC-500\n""""""""""""""""""""""""\n\nWe had a great victory in turning back the eastern convoy, but a couple of transports from the western convoy made it to port.  Reconnaissance photographs indicate that they are severely damaged - we will finish the job.  You will level bomb from 4000 metres.  There is no sense in taking excessive risks for this dirty job.\n\nAfter this you will return to the Fatherland for your leave.  You have earned it as a bomber pilot who is a credit to Germany.  Let us have a  good party before you go away, and let the English enjoy the benefit of some of your fighting spirit.\n
