It is a shame that such brave men should perish.  But such is the game of war.  It is a game that we must play to win.\n\nTwo of the enemy ships managed to limp into the harbour of Valletta and there they remain.  We have lost the chance to scuttle their cargoes, but we can at least ensure they do not leave to return again.  You will dive from 3500 metres and deliver your bombs onto their top decks.\n\nThough the enemy have only a few fighters, you will see they are feisty.  Yes, those British fliers like to fight.  We will send along the "Udet" boys to escort you.  They are more than a match for the decrepit contraptions that the Royal Air Force will send up to meet you.\n\n\n
