One is heading west from Egypt, and the other one east from Gibraltar.  We cannot allow this relief to reach its destination.  The English must starve upon their rock.\n\nYou will attack the eastern convoy.  Our gallant Italian friends will also be attacking by air and sea, so re-tune your wireless sets if you don't want to hear their excitable gabbling.  You will be entertained quite enough as it is.  Go to it, and show the men of the British Empire who it is that rules this dusty lake.\n
