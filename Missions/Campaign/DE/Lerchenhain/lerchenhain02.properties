Name B-25
Short B-25\n
Description Date: April 21 1946\nTime: 1400\nWaeather: Hazy\n\nManner!\nA bunch of American B-25 have been sighted in the south. We have four planes ready to intercept, and today you will have the X4 rockets available. But watch out for the fightercover, use your speed to avoid them and make sure they don't follow you back here. If you have to go down with fighters on your heels, use any area but this. Maybe you can even get them with your cannons. The allies don't know much about the Lerche yet so they are for sure in for a surprise!\nLos, los!\n\n\n
