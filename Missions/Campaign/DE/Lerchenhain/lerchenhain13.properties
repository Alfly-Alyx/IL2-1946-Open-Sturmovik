Description Date: June 3 1946\nTime: 1400\nWeather: good\n\nOur friends from the Heer are setting up an A4 launch just north of the valley. From what we know, the Americans know where to look because a group of lowriders, Thunderbolts maybe, broke through the defences and are headed this way. Four planes with X4 take off, we are getting help from JG302 but they might be late. \n\nHurry up, this can get messy!\n
