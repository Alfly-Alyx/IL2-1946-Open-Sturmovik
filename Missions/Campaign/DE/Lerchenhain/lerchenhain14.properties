Description Date: June 8 1946\nTime: 1900\nWeather: Hazy\n\nSorry to mess up you plans for tonight but Freya reports a group of high flying B-29 from the west in this area. JG304 has already stripped them of the escort, they are in dogfights. We have the four alertplanes ready with the X4, so waste no time. They cruise at 7000m so you have a bit to climb. Make sure you get back before it is too dark. \nLos!\n
