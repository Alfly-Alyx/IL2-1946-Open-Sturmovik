Name B-29
Short B-29\n
Description Date: April 25 1946\nTime: 1530\nWeather: good\n\nAchtung!\n\nLeutnant Specht was killed  due to an engine malfunction shortly after take off the last time. So be carfull, I can't repeat that enough.\n\nOne of the rare big daylight raids of the Americans is on it's way eastward. They are surely headed for a high priority target like fuel plants or A4 sites, otherwise they won't come by day since the "Grosse Schalg" campaigns in 45 ended the big daylight operations for the Americans. Now the B-29s only come in daylight when the target can't be hit exactly enogh by night.\n1. Gruppe will intercept, today we have help from JG304 and JG7. Again, whatch out for the fighters.\nWegtreten.\n\n\n
