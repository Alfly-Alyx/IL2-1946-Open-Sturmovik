Description Date: May 15 1946\nTime: 1200\nWeather: good\n\n*The Einsatzkommando Lerche is to relocate into the Alpenfestung. The new base is to be set up on the eastern shore of Kaisersee (D4).*\nAgain the groundtroops set up camp in the woods. The weather is very pleasent lately and so you don't mind having a little trip to the Alps, sitting by the lake, swimming with the local Frauleins - The Lerche pilots make quite an impression with the them, that is for sure. \nYou wonder waht the reason is for the movement to the Alps. Rumor has it, that operation Waffeleisen in the west came to a halt and was thrown back by the Anglo-French forces into Belgium but two additional Panzerarmys put that to a halt too. \n\nIn the east things are working better for us. Kiev is in German hands again an a lot of production capacity is out of reach for allied bombing. But other than that no decission making blow in sight. \n\nAfter the american nuclear failure against Japan it looks like the draw stands after almost eight years. Time to go swimming with the Frauleins...\n\n
