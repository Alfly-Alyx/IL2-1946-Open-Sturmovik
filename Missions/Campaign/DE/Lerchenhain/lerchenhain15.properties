Description Date: June 15 1946\nTime: 1000\nWeather: Hazy\n\nCeasefire! \nOn June 14th 1946 the OKW ordered all troops on the western front to move into their positions and to cease all hostile operations. The Allied command has done the same. Further ordres are to follow.\n\nIn the west it seems the war is over and surely the east is not far from it. Finally this has found an end. What happens next is up to the politicians but one thing is for sure, we all want peace now.\n\nPilot!\nwe have a situation on Mount Lysaya. A Ju 52 crashlanded on the northern flank early this morning. Three men made it, one seriously wounded but we cannot get to them in time. The Lerche is the only thing that can get the wounded man down here fast enough. You will take off and try to land at the crashsite which is marked with fires, get the man on board and return to the old Heiderburg airfield. A SanKra is waiting there. The site is over 2000m so you will need much more throttle to hover at the landing.\nTake care, this is not going to be easy. \n
