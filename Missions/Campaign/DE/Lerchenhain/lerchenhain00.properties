Description Date: April 15 1946\nTime: 0730\nWeather: Hazy\n\nNot much movement on all fronts. The winter is over but neither side has shown much interest in big offensive movements yet. In the west the Allied forces still are digged in in the Paris pocket, the Netherlands and Belguim are disputed territory but no major movements also. Yet.\n\nThe Einsatzkommando Lerche is still fresh into combat with only a few missions in the Reichsverteidigung, still somewhat experimental. The Lerche plane, although ordered combat ready has it's flaws, especially with the automatic stabilizer. So be cautious. But now order was given to move the unit closer to the hot zone in the west, into a major operation area for British and American Air Forces trying to destroy German infrastructure in praparation for a bigger assault as we asume.\n\nThe unit is moving to a new base located at B/C4 in a clearing northwest of the village. The groundcrews have put up a camp in the woods over the last few days and today the planes come in. Second Gruppe is already there, you may see them being towed to cover. \nlocate the campsite and land in a safe area. The ground is flater towards the road, so don't land too close to the woods.\n\n*airstart*\n\n
