Description Date: May 30 1946\nTime: 1300\nWeather: Hazy\n\nThat was action the other day! Even the guys from JG5 who came to aid where impressed. They asked for a permission to visit us and shake hands to those pilots. They have heard of the Lerche but never saw one. Well, singing birds became rare lately.\nFrom what I saw yesterday the ShootingStar shooting did the trick with this blond braided Fraulein you used to hang around? I heard the villagers officially named this side of the lake the *Lerchenhain*. \n\nBut enough of that for now. Two high flying recons from the southeast. I bet they are checking what happend to their new jets.\nWell, you know the drill, so let the bird sing.\nMarsch, Marsch\n
