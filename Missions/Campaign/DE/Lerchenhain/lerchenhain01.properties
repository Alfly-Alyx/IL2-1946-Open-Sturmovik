Description Date: April 18 1946\nTime: 1030\nWeather: good\n\nA group of British fighterbombers where detected coming in low. Their target is either the old airfield at C3 or the Heereskommandoposten at D3. They will pass just south of us in a few moments so we have only two machines ready. Watch your ammunition, only fire when you are sure to hit, don't waste it!\nLos, Manner, I can already hear them!\n
