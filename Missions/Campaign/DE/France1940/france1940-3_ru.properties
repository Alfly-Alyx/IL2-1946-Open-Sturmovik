Description May 12, 1940.\n\nLast evening the Belgian Command started withdrawing its forces behind a line from Namur to Antwerp line. At the same time French and British forces are rushing to their aid. Strong French units has reached near Gembloux, near Hannut, to cover the "Gembloux gap", a flat area of terrain, devoid of prepared or entrenched positions. \n\nThere is also signs that our enemy is preparing to fight in the line Namur-Dinant. \n\nSo there is surely heavy fighting ahead.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nOur quick advance in Belgium has evidently worried our enemies: they have started attacking the bridges we have captured with droves of bombers, helped altough not escorted by strong fighter sweeps.\n\nWe will counter this with our own fighter sweeps. Your task is to fly over the important Namur-Dinant gap, and attack all enemy aircraft you can find. Bombers are of course a priority!\n
