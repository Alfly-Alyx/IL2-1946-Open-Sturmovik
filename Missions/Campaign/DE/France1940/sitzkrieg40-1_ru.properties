Description Western Germany, Winter of 1939.\n\nYou know what they call this? "Sitzkrieg" - the sitting war! And that's just what we are doing: sitting around, doing nothing but eventless border patrols.\n\nThis is so strange! We are at war with France and England, yet neither side has made a significant move since the fall of Poland. \n\nWhile most of our army was engaged in Poland, a much smaller German force manned the Siegfried Line, our fortified defensive line along the French border. At the Maginot Line on the other side of the border, British and French troops are facing us, but there are only local, minor skirmishes, long-range shelling, and small skirmishes in the air. (There is no serious bombings either: the only thing the British are dropping on our rear areas are... propaganda leaflets!)\n\nOur unit has not seen anything resembling combat for over a month now. At the same time, this is perhaps the coldest winter in thirty years. And yesterday it snowed again.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYou and a wingman are going to escort a recce aircraft that is scouting the border. They usually do their runs unmolested, but you can never know.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nIf you want to fly in the same camo as your wingmen, use the following skin: "Bf-109E-1 Neumann unmarked.bmp", with markings "On". \n
