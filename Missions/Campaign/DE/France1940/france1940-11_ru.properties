Description June 11, 1940.\n\nOur offensive in the west rolls on: it seems to be unstoppable!  \n\nThe Panzers have reached the Seine and crossed the Marne. The Dunkirk evacuation was evidently a big blow to French morale: it was seen as an act of abandonment.Yesterday the French government fled to Bordeaux, declaring Paris an open city. Also Italy has now stepped in the war on our side.\n\nThe French must surely be on the verge of collapse now! \n\nYOUR MISSION\nFrench aerial resistance is very low, and rumor has it many of their surviving aircraft are being withdrawn to French North Africa instead. The Stukas can do what they please now!\n\nBut in an obvious attempt to divert our attention the RAF has started bombing various targets on the Channel coast.\n\nWe cannot allow this. Your task today is to patrol the coast between Dunkerque and Calais, and intercept all enemy bombers trying to attack.\n
