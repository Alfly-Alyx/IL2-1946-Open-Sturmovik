Description May 16, 1940.\n\nBREAKTHROUGH!!!\n\nYesterday, in heavy fighting, Guderian's motorised infantry dispersed the reinforcements of the newly formed French Sixth Army in their assembly area west of Sedan, undercutting the southern flank of the French Ninth Army by 40 kilometres and forcing an enemy Fortress Division to leave its positions that had blocked the tanks of XVI Army Corps at Montherm\u00E9. \n\nThe French Second Army has been seriously mauled and the French Ninth Army has begun to disintegrate completely.\n\nThe Panzer divisions of Guderian and Rommel have broken out of the bridgehead and are moving as fast as they can towards the west. Guderians Panzers are moving towards Marle, eighty kilometres from Sedan, while Rommel is already moving towards the river Sambre.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday you will go on a Free Hunt over the rapidly advancing Panzers that are moving towards the west. Attack any enemy aircraft that you can find!\n\n
