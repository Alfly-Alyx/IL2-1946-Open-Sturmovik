Description June 15, 1940.\n\nIt has happened! Paris has fallen! Our defeat in the last war has been revenged! There are rumors about the French Government wishing to negotiate an armistice.\n\nVictory is ours! Soon.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThere still is some mopping up to do. There is no more French resistance in the air, and their army seems to be on the verge of collapse, but there still remains some British forces, that are now desperately trying to disentangle themselves from the French debacle.\n\nSome 11.000 British troops are now trapped in Le Havre, and Churchill is obviously hoping for a repeat performance of the Dunkerque evacuation. We in the Luftwaffe, with complete mastery of the French skies, are determined to prevent this.\n\nTherefore we have been transferred down to Britanny, to an airfield outside Dieppe.\n\nYour task is to do a free hunt over Le Havre, preventing enemy fighters from stopping our bombers in their attacks on British shipping in the harbour.\n\nHISTORICAL NOTE\nOne week later, June 22, the armistice between France and Germany was signed. France was afterwards divided into a German occupation zone in the north and west and a nominally independent state in the south, to be based in the spa town of Vichy, dubbed Vichy France. \n\nAt this stage only one enemy remained for Germany to defeat: Great Britain...\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the last mission in this campaign. Thanks for playing it and congratulations for completing it!\n\nThere is a continuation of this campaign, called "Storm over England" and covering the Battle of Britain from July to October 1940.
