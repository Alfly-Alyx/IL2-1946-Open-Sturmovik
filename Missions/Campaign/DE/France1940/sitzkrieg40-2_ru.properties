Description Western Germany, Winter of 1939.\n\nThe boring "Sitzkrieg" continues. Nothing has happened since that last dogfight over the border - just routine patrols. \n\nPerhaps there will be no big war after all? \n\nThe only real action is on the sea. A couple of months ago our heroic pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee fought a brave action against an overwhelming enemy might at the Battle of the River Plate. And last week there was a serious incident in Norwegians waters: Altmark, one of our supply ships, was attacked and taken by British ships, in total disregard of all rules. You can't trust Perfidious Albion!\n\nThe record-cold winter weather continues.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nNow it's payback time. A French Potez recce plane has been doing a scouting mission over our part of the border, and is now trying to get back to it's base.\n\nThe task of you and your Schwarm is to shoot it down!\n\nBut mind you: it is escorted. So prepared for a fight! \n
