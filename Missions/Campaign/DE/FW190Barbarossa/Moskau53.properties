Description Date: 31.12.1941\n\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\n\n\nWeather: clear\n\n\nOur troops suffered heavy losses due to Soviet air-raids but at least we were able to weaken the attacks a bit. You did good work. However, Oberkommando does not sleep and wants to give the Ivan a big cheer in return. Target is the main supply depot near Mozhaysk. We are gathering several wings for this attack.\nIf possible, you will attack ground targets, too.\nBy the way, you have been nominated for a decoration of honour, confirmation should be here within a few moments. \nWell, get out and up, you have work to do first!\n\n\n\n
