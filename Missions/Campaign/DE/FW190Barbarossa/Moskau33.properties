Description Date: 10.10.1941\n\nTime: 04:00 p.m.\n\nWeather: misty\n\nWe get supplies today and we need them badly. Fly to Volokolamsk again and escort the Ju-52 back to our field.\n\n***Mission-note: I assume that you are Rottenf\u00FChrer already. If not, the AI-Rottenf\u00FChrer will not circle above the airfield and wait for the Ju-52s to take off, but will return home. :-)***\n\n\n
