Description Date: 03.03.1942    \n\nTime: 02:00 p.m.\n\nWeather: good\n\nLocation: Berlin/Potsdam Gatow Airport\n\n\n\nThis is your lucky day! All the big shots of the Reich are around to see how you can handle the new FW190. They await you on the Truppen\u00FCbungsplatz, the testing range north of Sperenberg.\nYou will take a 500kg bomb and attack captured Russian T-34 tanks. They are parked inside an illuminated square field. You cannot miss it.\n\nThere are some trucks just near the tanks, inside a circle. You will attack them with your new cannon.\n\nJust make sure that they all see what the new bird can do to our enemies. Good luck!\n\n\n
