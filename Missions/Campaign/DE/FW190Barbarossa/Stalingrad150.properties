Description \nDate: 02.02.1943\n\nTime: 11:00\n\nWeather: good\n\n\n\nAt 8:40 in the morning, the surrounded defenders in the north of Stalingrad surrendered. The battle for Stalingrad is over.\nDuring 72 days and nights the Luftwaffe has flown about 100 tons into the ring every day. This was only one third of the material that was needed to survive and go on fighting, but on the other hand 24,000 wounded soldiers could be flown out.\nAbout 90,000 soldiers are marching into prison camps, deep into Soviet territory.\nThe 6th Armee could have started a counter-attack, but Hitler commanded them to hold their position.\n\nYou will fly into the ring of Stalingrad to Gumrak and meet the last Ju-52s that are departing.\nWhen you are back, report to the Kommodore. He was informed about your injuries. That should be cured, althought you might think that this is rather ridiculous. Well, it is not!\n\n\n
