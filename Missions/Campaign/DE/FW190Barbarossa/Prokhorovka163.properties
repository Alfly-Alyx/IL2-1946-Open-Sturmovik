Description Date: 11.07.1943\n\nTime: 01:00 p.m.\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nIt has been raining all morning. Two divisions of the IInd SS-Panzerkorps have broken through a narrow Soviet defence-line. They advanced towards the area south-west of Prokhorovka, where they again encountered defences. They have just cabled for air support.\nFly to that area and provide cover for the Stukas, who will destroy the Russian tanks. Try to take out flak as well, but if you come over enemy fighters, these got priority, for sure.\n\nBe careful, wegtreten.\n\n
