Description Date: 16.07.1943\n\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nHitler has stopped "Unternehmen Zitadelle". The situation in the Mediterranean is getting tough for the german troops. Yesterday, our forces were re-arranged and "Operation Roland" is starting. The IInd SS-Panzerkorps has split from the 4th Panzerarmee and is ordered to gather west of Belgorod to be transported from there to the Mediterranean.\nRegarding the results of "Zitadelle", history will speak of us as "the lost victors". Our troops were deep within enemy territory, about 10 kilometres in the north and about 40 kilometres in the south. Now we can see that the Soviet strategy was to provoke a German advance and then to deal with it from a safe position. It worked, unfortunately! Although the Soviets suffered heavy losses, they did succeed!\n\n\nOur losses: 30,700 dead\n\n\nSoviet losses: over 250,000 dead, 600,000 wounded, 33,000 captured\n\n\nDestroyed German tanks destroyed: about 1,500, 30% of them could not be recovered and therefore are lost.\n\nRussian tanks destroyed: 4,150 in July 1043, 2.400 of them in the battle of Kursk.\n\n\nYour mission: Fly along the road from Stariy Oskol to Belgorod, make sure that the retreating IInd Panzerkorps reaches Belograd.\nWhen you come back, we will transfer to the Kuban. Dismissed!\n\n\n
