Description ###############################\ndate : 13 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 17:30\nweater : Hazy\n###############################\n\nFew, that was close!\n\nAllright, you might be wondering about two things right now.\n\n1. What are those F4's doing standing by near the runway?\n2. Why have we been calling for a briefing and not for dinner?\n\n1. Those F4's are your kites right now.\n2. Because only eight minutes a go we received a call asking for immediate air cover at the area you have just patrolled.\n\nIt seems you haven't been there long enough to kick all enemies out.\n\nPretty sure your ammo drums are empty and so is your fuel. We have readied four F4's to take off immediately.\n\n**But sir, can't we use those Focke Wulfs?**\n\nThe FW190's still need some repair and maintenance. So it would be too risky to send them in.\n\nAllright, move it!!!\nWhen you get back you can move straight to the mess for dinner.\n
