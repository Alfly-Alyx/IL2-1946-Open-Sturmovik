However this is what I currently have.\n \nYesterday's statistics: \n##########################\nEnemy kills : 5\nLosses : 2\n##########################  \n \n... Alex: Are these kills officially confirmed by the Luftwaffe High command or just confirmed local?\n\nLocal, offical will take another year possibly.\n\n... Christian: Yeah probably. I am waiting for my kills to be confirmed since last April.\n\n... Alex:I see gunboats fitted. IL2 busting again?\n\nYes, exactly. Our right flank is being endangered by Soviet armour and has an almost continues support by Soviet ground attack aircraft.\n\nFor having any chance at all to stop the horde of armour we should have a clear airspace.\n\nYour task of achieving it.\n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n6 Udo Maus \n7 Miroslav Meister \n
