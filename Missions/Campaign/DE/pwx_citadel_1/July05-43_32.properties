Description ###############################\n date : 05/ 07/ 1943 \n time : 14:15 \n weater : Clear\t\n ###############################\n \n \n We have suffered heavy casulties during the last Soviet attack on our formations.\n\n3rd Panzergruppe has just launched another attack in the direction of Pokrovka. Heavy enemy opposition has thrown them back once but expected is that they will hold it this time.\n\nOur infantry is throwing an all out attack in all directions but the mudd from yesterday is bogging down our vehicles.\n\nExcept delayed by mudd the enemy air offensive is also starting to take its toll. An almost constant air offensive is putting a heavy pressure on our forces.\n\nDespite the huge losses they took last morning they still seem to have enough to attack us.\n\nWe are ordered to patroll the bridge southern of our current position. It is marked with a red square on your map.\n\nGood luck\n  \n  Your flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n
