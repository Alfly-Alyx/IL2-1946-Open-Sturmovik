Description ###############################\ndate : 12 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 07:00\nweater : snow\n###############################\n\nGentlemen,\n\nSorry for waking you up that early, but important things need to be done.\n\nOur recon has learned us that the enemy is bringing in fresh reinforcements.\n\nHowever we do not know where.\nWe assume the 1st Guard\u2019s received fresh tanks. \nAnd if so our task will be to destroy them.\n\nAnyway your task will be simply reconnaissance.\nWe want to know if the enemy received the reinforcements. And more important.\nHow many.\n\nFlight altitude will be around 800 meters. This will keep you only just below the clouds. This giving you a good opportunity to hide when things would get hot.\nHowever we do not expect it to get hot, it always is a handy feature.\n good luck.\n\nNote you might run into enemy fighters. But try to avoid them.\n\n\n
