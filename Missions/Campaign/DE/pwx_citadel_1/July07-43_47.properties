Our Tigers destroy Soviet tanks by dozens but for every T-34 that is destroyed another four appear. Compare it to the mythology two headed snake. Every head you chop off two grow back instantly.\n\n... Christian: Sounds bad!\n\nIt is. We weren't prepared for this. It looks like the dogs of the Lucy spy ring did their work properly. The bastards. I hope they nail the guy and hang it to the highest tree.\n\n... Walther: Well sir, that won't chance our current situation.\n \nNo it doesn't we should have hung him before the war broke out.\n\n... Alex: Haning a man won't solve a problem. Just putting him to jail for a little while until the war would be over would. Then he would be innersent and would be kept that way.\n\nMaybe you are right.\n\nThe current task I have for you is to escort the Schlachtwaffen towards targets near Peny.  \n \nThe Soviets have places large armoured formations near the village that can be deployed any minute. Therefore it is up to them to destroy them.\n\nYour task is to make sure they succeed.\n\nGood luck.\n \n  Your flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n6 Udo Maus \n7 Miroslav Meister \n
