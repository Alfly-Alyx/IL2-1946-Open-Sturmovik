I tell you it is hell down there.\n \nIt might sounds strange to you but the Soviets keep  on using their railroads. Even those extremely close towards the front.\n\nOur ground troops had to do battle with forces defending trains more than once.\n\nOur spotters have sighted a Soviet train arriving at the railway only minutes a go and it is unloading at the moment of speaking.\n\nWe are appointed to escort a group of He-111 bombers that will raid the facillity.\n\nAnd it is up to us to make sure they arrive safely over target.\n\nGood luck\n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n6 Udo Maus \n7 Miroslav Meister \n8 Anton Schneider \n9 Manfred Baumann \n10 Ernst Lehmann \n11 Michael Kadinsky \n
