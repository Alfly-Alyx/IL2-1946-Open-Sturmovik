Unfortunately.\n\nIts  not you guys to blame, you simply couldn't make it any faster.\n\n-- Sir, Christian was grounded for two days wasn't it?\n\nYes he is, but I needed two good men to go in ASAP and he was the only one at hand. Together with you.\n\n** Mentjovski, how nice of you to remind him!!!!\n\n-- No hard intentions Christian, rather meant that he wouldn't punish you for going into the air anyway because he ordered  you to do so himself.\n\n** Mentjovski, hmm, okay.\n\nLadies, keep this chat for dinner.\n\nThe battle is going on at the hill and recon tells us more tanks have gathered behind the hill.\n\nUp to you with a Jabo mission to destroy as many as possible.\n\nAfter that you are free to hunt.\n\nS!\n\n\n
