Description ###############################\ndate : 15 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 06:00\nweater : Clear\n###############################\n\nGents,\n\nFine job last morning, It looks like the offensive is stagnating.\n\nThe xx Schwere Panzer Abteilung knew to halt them.\nAlthough still engaged in heavy fighting the horde of Soviet tanks isn't rolling on as unstoppable as last morning at three o clock.\n\nQuite an impressive sight wasn't it?\n\n** Drache, sure was, however when you realize what's really happening you think different about it.\n\nI said it was impressive, not beautiful.\n\n** Drache, true.\n\nAnyway your mission before breakfast will be some nice Jabo aktions.\n\nLocated halfway up the hill are a battery of anti-tank guns. They seem to bother the panzers a lot.\n\nSo up to us to clear the way.\n\n** Haubner, how about enemy air activity sir?\n\nGood question, actually surprisingly little. Usually the skies would swarm of those IL2 buggers. But now not even one appeared.\n\n** Vahn, what about fighters?\n\nFighters, the ones you encountered last morning where the only ones.\n\nSo I don't expect much now either.\n\nAny questions?\n\nOkay, have a safe return!\n
