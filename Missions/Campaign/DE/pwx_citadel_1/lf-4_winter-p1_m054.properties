Description ###############################\ndate : 16 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 12:15\nweater : Hazy\n###############################\n\n Unfortunately, despite your great efforts some valuable panzers have been lost due to enemy aircraft.\n\nThe enemy horde launched another attack only thirty minutes a go and the hill has been lost\n\n** Mentjovski, like I said, we are going to move within a couple of days again.\n\nQuit the sceptics Chris!!, we'll never make it that way!\n\nAn enemy transport flight has been spotted taking off.\n\nYou are ordered to intercept them.\nOur reports indicated that they are escorted but only light.\n\nSo I assume six aircraft to be enough.\n\nAlso your gun pods from the previous mission are still underneath your aircraft and fully reloaded.\n\n** Haubner, how many aircraft is it supposed to be we have to intercept?\n\nActually, I don't know to be honest.\n\nCan't really read what Werner wrote there.\n\nLooks like 12+.\n\n** Mentjovski, let me see.\n\n(, with a strange looking smile he handed over the paper to Chris, who responded dismayed : )\n\n** Mentjovski, no way sir that's 20+,\n** Mentjovski, rather send in eight aircraft instead of six.\n\nQuestions? \n\n,,,\n\nNone?\n\n-- What do we get for dinner tonight?\n\nYou will see that by then.\n\nDismissed!! \n\nGood hunting!!\n
