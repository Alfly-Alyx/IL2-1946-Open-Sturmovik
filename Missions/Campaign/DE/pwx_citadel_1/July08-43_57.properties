Christian: I don't hope you expect us to fly do you sir?\n\nWell actually I do.\n\n... Alex: You are kidding right?\n\nNo not at all. \n \n.... Walther: This is insane? Why? a scramble?\n\nNo else I would not have been as calm as I am now.\n\nJabo escorts.\n\n... Steffen: They are nuts!! nobody is going to fly with such weather.\n\nWell obviously there are people who do.  \nA recon vehicle has spotted numerous of artillery pieces being set into place just two Kilometres North West of Ivica.\n\nModel has thrown in his last Panzer reserve into battle and to keep the momentus going we should not spare any effort to eliminate threats that could bog down this final trust.\n\n... Michael: Yes and so? Can't the infantry just do this?\n\nWhat? Four Kilometres behind enemy lines?\nHow do you want to do that?\n\n... Michael: Don't know. Special units?\n\nYeah, well we only have a few of those and it isn't up to us to deploy them. I only get orders and I have to forward them to you.\n\nThis attack will be performed by Jabo's. Fw-190's and Bf-109's.\n\n... Christian: When do they learn the Bf-109 isn't a fighter bomber but a fighter?\n\nI don't know. \n\nbut no more questions please. Board your crates and guide the jabo's to target.\n\nGood luck!!\n\n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n
