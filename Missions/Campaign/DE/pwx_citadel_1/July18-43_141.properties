Alex: yes?\n\nYour aircraft has been repaired?\n\n... Alex: Was it broken?\n\nWell your right flap wasn't working anymore and your tail was slightly bend due to your rough landings.\n\nThe mechanic installed some new flaps but even then it flew in a nice curve without even touching the controlls.\n\nDidn't you noticed that?\n\n... Alex: I think it is fatique.\n\nYou mean the damage or...?\n\n... Alex: I mean the reason for me not to notice yet.\n\nWell okay, its ready now. And the only think you need to do is take it for a test ride.\n\nA row of fires has been ignited near the airfield. Try to fly over it and see if your kite flies a straight line.\n \n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n\n
