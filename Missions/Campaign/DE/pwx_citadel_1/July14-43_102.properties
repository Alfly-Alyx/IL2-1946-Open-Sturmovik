I even received a bucket of flowers from a nice lady who was quite happy to see us.\n\nSo all this means your new airfield will be Ivica airfield.\n\nPack your bags and leave. \n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n6 Udo Maus \n7 Miroslav Meister \n
