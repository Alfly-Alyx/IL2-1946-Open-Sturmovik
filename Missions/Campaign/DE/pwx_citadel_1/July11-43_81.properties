Alex: As long as my crate can be reached by a swim competition with my fellow pilots I won't call it dry.\n\n... Udo: The sky idiot! The sky.\n... Udo: I am not mentioning the terrain!\n\n... Alex: Whatever....\n\nCan't you keep these kind of chats for the prison camp or for when you are back home again?\n\n... Christian: Well sir, when you are used to this it means you are ready to marry. Hahahaha.\n\nMaybe you're right or maybe not. But I guess you aren't married?\n\n... Christian: I will marry, really soon. Haven't I told you before? Met a beautifull lady called Laura.\n\n... Christian: Blonde hair, beautifull eyes. She is gorgeous.\n\n... Alex: Ofcourse he likes her. Otheriwise he wouldn't marry her would he.\n\n(*Sigh,,*)\n\nOkay, target is Bolshie Gorodishe. Our Kampfgeschwaders will attack enemy positions in the area. It seems to be quite hot so escort has been requested.\n\nThe weather is improved so the claim that enemy is quite active again is to be taken serious.\n\nPay attention to your six and get those guys back home safe.\n\nDismissed!  \n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n6 Udo Maus \n7 Miroslav Meister \n
