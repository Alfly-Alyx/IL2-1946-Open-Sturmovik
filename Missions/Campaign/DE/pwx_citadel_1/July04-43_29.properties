Commanders are nervous. The guys who bring papers all day long are in a constant hurry and now at the last moment of the day they ask us to escort another recon mission.\n\nSo how obvious!\n\n... Christian: I don't hope its that obvious to the Soviets.\n\nYes it is already. We have a spy in our networsk.\nEver heard of Lucy?\n\n... Christian: Not really.\n\nWell it is probably the biggest jerk on earth. We still don't get how he does it and wherefrom he get's it or where he is but he receives our orders before we do and then forwards it to the Russians.\nCausing heavy losses of lives each day.\n\n... Christian: And the guy is a German?\n\nYes.\n\n... Alex: The traitor!!!!, they should hang him.\n\nIf they get him they probably will. \n\nBut on topic guys, we are way off again.\nA Fw-189 is flying overhead already and expects us to escort it.\n\nDo your job and get it up and down safely.\n\nI expect to see all of you within an hour.\n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n
