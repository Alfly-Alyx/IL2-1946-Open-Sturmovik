Alex: What is the battle outcome?\n\nThe enemy assault was stopped and reversed in a counter attack.\n\nMy compliments.\n\nHowever it really looks like the Soviets have inexhaustible supplies.\n\nWhile you were gone a raid of approx thirty IL2's has been beaten off by the remaining fighters on base.\n\nFurther had to blow the railway between Prokhorovka and Belenhino due to a constant attempt by the Russians to penetrate our defenses with armoured trains.\n\n... Christian: Those things are relatively easy to crack. As long as you know how it works they are a piece of cake.\n\nYeah but they can be a pain in the ass for our ground troops.\n\n... Alex: I get it.\n\n... Christian: Can't we just mine the rails with magnetic mines? As soon as a train passes it blows.\n... Christian: Better result than just stopping them by demolishing its tracks.\n\nMaybe but it would be too costly I think. Besides I am not the one to decide.\n\nBut you already knew that.\n\nI'd say put your asses in gear! Enemy bombers spotted above Korochka and heading towards Belgorod sector.\n\nApproximate height is 4 Kilometres. \n  \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n
