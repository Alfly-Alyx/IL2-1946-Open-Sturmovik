Your planes are filled and reloaded.\nSpotters have sighted at least three Russian nightwitche heading South West Direction.\nMost likely target is Borisovka.\n\n... Christian: Why do you suspect that sir?\n\nI don't but high command does. But I agree with them. This due to the fact we have downed two Soviet Recon planes in this sector. And who knows maybe more have gotten away.\n\nBut these planes are only very light and weakly armed. So I want to send out only you two because if I would send out more it would only cause confusion.\n\nGood luck.\n  \n \n \n  Your flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n
