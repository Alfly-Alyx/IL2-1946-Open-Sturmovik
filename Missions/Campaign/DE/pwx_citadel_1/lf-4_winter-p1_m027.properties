But you made it. And that's the point.\n\n** Mentjovski, the point is that I want to survive this friggin war.\n\nYou're right but I did my best to send in a large number of kits and I think I succeeded in it.\n\n** Haubner, We have a large number of kites available at this base. Can't we deploy them all?\n\nIf we would deploy them all who should defend the base then? Not to be honest, we simply can't deploy them.\n\nThey are not all under my command.\n\nJust this Staffel.\n\n** Mentjovski, that explains.\n\nAnyway, this mission won't be much different from your previous.\n\nA fighter sweep a la patrol style.\n\nI want you guys to patrol a large area and try to lure op as many enemy aircraft as we can.\n\n** Mentjovski, they saw me so they won't come.\n\nI won't count on that.\n\nNow move it, \n
