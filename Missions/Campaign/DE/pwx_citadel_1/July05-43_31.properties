Christian: The question remains, is this much?\n\nSigh*\n\nThe good news is that we have recaptured Yakovlevo rail yard again. And in tact.\n\n... Alex: GREAT!!! Any Soviet tanks captured too?\n\nNone, sorry.\n\nA down side is that the Soviets are doing everything to destroy the facillity plus the bridge.\n\nOur tanks are crossing it whole day already. Last morning Russian Sappers tried to blow it but it failed. Now they are trying to correct it by air what they failed last morning.\n\nSo get your asses in gear and prepare for the worst to come at you.\n\nGood luck.\n\n... Christian: Where to head sir?\n\nWasn't I clear?\n\nYakovlevo!!\n\n \n  \n \n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n
