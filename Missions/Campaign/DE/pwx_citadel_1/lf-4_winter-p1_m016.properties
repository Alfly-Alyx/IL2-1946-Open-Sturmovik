Description ###############################\ndate : 13 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 14:25\nweater : Snow\n###############################\n\nA fine job you did last mission, however unfortunately the 2nd staffel did  not.\n\nAnd all of the guns are still barking.\nIn other words you have to go out again.\n\nHowever this time not as the Jabo but as the escorts.\nYour task will be to ensure a safe arrival of the Jabo's above target. After that they are on their own and free to hunt.\n\nI do have a second job for you to do. And that's to verify that all guns your staffel previously attacked are all silent and dead.\nAnd not just keeping themselves quiet or are under repair.\n\nDang!!, I just see it is snowing. Its not getting any easier is it huh?\n\nAnyway good luck, and make sure I see you within an hour in one piece!\n
