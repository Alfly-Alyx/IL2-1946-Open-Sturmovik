Today will be a day of clearing.\nWe will have to elliminate a large number of targets that could pose a threat.\n\nYour very first mission for today will also be the escorting of Stuka's that will attack a Soviet tank assembly area located at Rzhavets.\n\nThe weather is poor so it is the worst you could ask for when you want to perform a dive bombing mission from high altitude but we have mapped the target quite well so navigating towards target can happen flying blind.\n\nEnemy opposition is expected high so be prepared for the worst.\n\nGood luck.\n\nOh and by the way :\n\nYesterday's statistics: \n##########################\nEnemy kills : 10\nLosses : 1\n##########################\n \n  \n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n
