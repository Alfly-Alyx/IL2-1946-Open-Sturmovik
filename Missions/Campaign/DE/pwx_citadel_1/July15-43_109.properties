Although massively supported by ground attack aircraft we were able to repell the attack and we managed to destroy 68 Soviet airplanes in the sector. The number of enemy tanks destroyed during that day in that single sector stands at 334.\n \nThe next mission will be a patroll over Bolshaya Khalan. An offensive fighter sweep. Attacking enemy fighters is up to your own initiative.\n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n6 Udo Maus \n7 Miroslav Meister \n
