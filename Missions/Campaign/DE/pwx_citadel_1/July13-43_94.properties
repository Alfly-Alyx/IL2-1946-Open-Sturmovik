Alex: Sir that P-39 at the base, ...\n\nThat P-39? It was captured yesterday evening. It was shot down by members of JG-51.\n\n(* You and the commander are walking towards the captured plane, Christian is already inspecting the crate. *)\n\n... Alex: Strange to see a plane in front of you that you are used to have shoot down and have to be afraid of when it is at your six.\n... Alex: It looks that calm and quiet now.\n\nWould you like to try it?\n\n... Alex: When looking at the yawning holes it has in it rather not sir.\n\nIt looks in a bad shape but it is okay.\nThe mechanics have worked throughout the night to get it working again. We could sure use some replacement planes right now.\n\n... Christian: I don't want to know how the pilot ended.\n\nHe is alive, in bad conditions though but I think he will recover.\n\n... Alex: But can it actually fly?\nYes it can. The engine had only little damage and we still had another P-39 that had crashed near Belgorod last week.  We combined those two kites to this one.\n\nAs you see by the way on the nose the pilot must have been a fanatical communist supporter when you see the communist hammer and sickle spraypainted on it.\n\n... Alex: Yes but I also see the opinion of our technichian.\n\nHaha, no the painter. When he painted the plane he also painted a cross over it right away. But I am sure the technician will agree with him.\n\n... Christian: who would not agree with him isn't it?\n\nSure.\n\nBut, like to try it?\n\n... Alex: Ah well yes lets try the kite. Have you refuelled it?\n\nYes we have.\n\n... Alex: Okay let's go then. Although I do am worrying about the holes.\n\nNothing to worry about. Just a bit windy inside. But there's nothing wrong with some fresh air.\n\n... Christian: With a mixture of kerosine gasses. (*winks*)\n \n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n
