Description ###############################\ndate : 13 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 12:40\nweater : Blind\n###############################\n\nGreat job on the previous mission guys!!!\nAs you might have noticed we now placed an artillery regiment just a  stone-throw away from the base  to pound them non-stop.\n\nThis will prevent them from settling on the base for a while.\n\nThe Soviet offensive is stalling at the very moment it seems. Because all major tank drives have come to a halt and they do not seem to have intentions to drive on very soon.\n\nHowever the small village near our previous base is still occupied by our comrades from the Whermacht.\n\nThey are now in a ever becoming smaller pocket.\n\nThey will try to break out this evening before the Soviets will resume their advance.\n\nBut before they will try, its up to us to weaken the enemy to make sure the break out will succeed.\n\nThe first phase of the plan is to destroy the bridge on the North-West of the village.\n\nThe Soviets use it  as a bridgehead to bring in new tanks and fresh troops every minute.\n\nTherefore it is of great importance that we destroy the bridge.\n\nYou will have cover from a schwarm of Me109F4's.\nThey are outdated but up to the job.\n\nNote you have to hurry and please if the bridge is down get back to base as soon as possible because the weather is deteriorating every hour.\nAnd we still have a lot to do before it gets impossible to fly.\n\nGood luck!\n
