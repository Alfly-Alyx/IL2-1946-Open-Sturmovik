Mentjovski: Sir, can you give us an actual update on te front situation?\n\nI am afraid not.. the progress is good but not quite as it should be.\n\nOur tanks are having great difficulties crossing the minefields. The retreating Soviet forces have planted hundreds of mines along the road and in through the entire battlefield.\n\nI wonder if the Soviets ever gain back territory, would they know where they burried their mines?\n\n... Alex: Listen if you hear a bang and look if you can see a Soviet helmet flying through the air.\n\nI see plenty of those every day, how to know weather it was caused by a mine or a grenade or a HE shell?\n\n... Mentjovski: Trust your instict! \n\nHaha, won't work I think.\n\n... Alex: What's the task you have in mind for us sir?\n\nNot me, but high command has.\nThey want you to escort a Jabo raid upon enemy forces near Korocha.\n\nA large group of enemy armor has been spotted by a recon plane.\nHigh command has ordered to raid it.\n\nThe flight parth is following the same as the Jabo's. The flight route is plotted on the map I just handed to you.\n\n... Christian: Sir are we allowed to perform a free hunt afterwards?\n\nWhen you have passed target and enemy presence is low you are.\n\nBut only then.\n\n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n6 Udo Maus \n7 Miroslav Meister \n8 Anton Schneider \n9 Manfred Baumann \n10 Ernst Lehmann \n11 Michael Kadinsky \n12 Peter Lemke \n13 Dieter Spah \n14 Frans Grunberg \n15 Marcus Pommel \n
