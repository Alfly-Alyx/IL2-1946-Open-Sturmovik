All of you!\nHubert!!, No drinking before flight please. \n\nDoes anyone have a cigarette for me?\n\nNo?, hmm too bad. Anyway we should receive supplies tomorrow and I think, lets say hope they bring in new smokes too.\n\nSo, what are you suppose to do now?\nI will tell you.\nRecon has learned high command that the enemy has located a large quantity of tanks just outside of our pocket.\n\nAssumed they are intended to overrun our positions there.\n\nTherefore it has been given top priority to destroy them.\nAnd they have sended a formation of Heinkel 111 bomber's.\n\nAnd at the moment of speaking, they are in bound and heading towards target.\n\nThey are escorted, but have requested back-up from the nearest friendly base.\n\nSo that mean's us!\n\nNo further explanation needed I guess.\n\nHead for the village. And assumed you will meat them there.\n\nBe careful, this weather is dangerous due to bad sight.\n\nGood luck!\n
