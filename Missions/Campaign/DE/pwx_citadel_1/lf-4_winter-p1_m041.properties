Description ###############################\ndate : 15 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 14:00\nweater : Clear\n###############################\n\nDang!!!, I have had it with those air attacks.\nLast morning they where nowhere and now they are everywhere.\n\nEven though we flattened their base, they still keep attacking us.\n\nWe sustained some heavy damage last time, and if this continues this way are forced to abandon this base soon.\n\n** Haubner, quit the chatter sir, I would rather like to know what we are up against now.\n\n( Sure!!, Menjovski, grinned, )\n\nThe enemy has taken the bridge and its armour is now within a 10 km radius of our airfield.\n\nThat means that we should get our asses there ASAP to cover our tanks in the area to push them back.\n\nYou are ordered to patrol the area to make sure they won't be destroyed from the air by Soviet ground attack aircraft.\n\nCannot ensure you anything, but if you hold them off, the Panzers might hold their tanks off.\n\nSo good luck.\n\n\n
