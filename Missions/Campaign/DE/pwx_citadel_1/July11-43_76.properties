Description ###############################\ndate : 11/ 07/ 1943 \ntime : 9:45 \nweather : Thunder\t\n###############################\n \nWeather has gone for worse, thunder and heavy bursts of rain.\n\nThe day has begun with some small fightings along the entire border. The exchange of small arms fire has continued throughout the entire night.\n\nIt was only until one hour a go since the first tank cannon's opened fire again.\n\nIt was also since two days we gained substancial terrain again. This on our Western flank. \n\nInteresting to know that it is only one o our weaker divisions equipped with Panzer IV's and Panzer III's that smashed through enemy defenses. But on the other side that was only poorly equipped with US build M4 Sherman's and British Valentine's.\n\n...Miroslav: Sir, what is the operational status of our forces?\n\nDifficult to say but it doesn't look too good.\nWe had to deploy most of our reserves in an attempt to stop the Soviet counter offensive of July 9th. The Soviets were afraid to be ovverun and have deployed seemingly most of their reserves.\nWich has forced us to deploy ours.\n\nWhen you compare the loss list at our side to those at the Soviet side and the one we have is only the one of whom the kills and tanks destroyed are the one that are confirmed.\n\nSo that means that the actual number of tanks and aircraft destroyed is even higher in reality.\n\nA big misconception is that when comparing the lists that you would think we are on the winning hand.\n\nE.g. the numbers lost by the enemy is nearly three to four times the number we have lost.\n\nHowever the biggest downside is that the enemy could probably take even eight times the loss while we cannot even take the losses we have to take right now.\n\nOut of the 200 PanzerKampfwagen V's Panther we have started with on July 5th only 40 are still operational. 130 are awaiting to be repaired.\n\nWe have been promised new tanks and new aircraft. But those reeinforcements are postponed all the time. So I don't expect them before Oktober.\nWich is ofcourse too late.\n\nOur airforce however has some small advantage over the Red Airforce. Yesterdays statistics show as an example.\n\nAlthough the actual number of sorties flown is quite low but this is due to the bad weather.\n\nOut of the three planes lost two are to an accident. Both pilots survived and fly again.\n \nYesterday's statistics: \n##########################\nEnemy kills : 14\nLosses : 3\n##########################\n \nAlthough the weather is quite risky weather to fly we are still forced to board our kites again because the enemy does too.\n\nThe Western flank is still moving and the tank battle I told you about is still going on.\n\nFour schwarm's of Hs 129B attack planes is on their way to the target area. They are in the need of escort.\n\nEnemy air activity is high, despite the bad weather.\n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n6 Udo Maus \n7 Miroslav Meister \n
