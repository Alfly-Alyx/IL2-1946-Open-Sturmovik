Description ###############################\ndate : 12 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 22:00\nweater : Hazy\n###############################\n\nGlad you arrived all safely this evening.\n\nOur forward observers spotted some night buzzers heading our way.\n\nThis means that outdated Soviet aircraft are heading our way.\n\nThese pre-war bi-plane bombers are armed with light but deadly bombs.\n\nThey are slow and therefore are able to drop their bombs with pin point accuracy.\n\nIts your task to patrol a 10Km Radius around the airfield to make sure no bombs hit the airfield.\n\nGood hunting!\n\nS!\n
