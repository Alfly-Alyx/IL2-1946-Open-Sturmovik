And last but not least also survive your stay.\n\nAllright, cigarette anyone??\n\nLets get to topic, you all know your previous base.\nA storch recon plane just landed and they stated that the airfield has been occupied by the red army.\n\nWe assume they want to get it back into shape again for their own use.\n\nThis should not happen. And therefore command has ordered us to attack the airfield with Jabo bombers.\n\nYou already noticed the bombs underneath your aircraft when you walked to this building.\n\nAnyway, target for IF they are present already enemy aircraft at the base. Enemy vehicles, and supplies.\n\nShouldn\u2019t be that hard.\n\nHave a nice flight!\n
