Description ###############################\ndate : 13 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 13:30\nweater : Blind\n###############################\n\nGreat, the bridge is down.\nMy condolences for the loss of your two fallen comrades. They where nice men. \n\nAlthough I didn't knew them that well yet. I spoke only two or maybe three times with them in the mess. They seemed very driven and enthusiastic.\n\nTo loose such men always is a great loss for the Luftwaffe.\n\nBut,!!! 2nd target, the enemy has positioned several artillery batteries at the other side of the river and just a few hundred meters above the village.\n\nYour staffel is to attack the 2nd.\n\nDestroy as many as possible guns.\nMake sure they do not survive this attack.\n\nA 2nd staffel will attack the 1st batteries.\n\nIf you do your work properly, then this mission will mean great relief for our forces there.\n\nS!\n\n
