Christian: Relax sir!, just stuffing an egg into my mouth. Breakfast!! Haven't had the time to eat it any earlier.\n\nOh guys I received yesterday's newspaper.\n\n... Alex: Ah!! Read aloud. \n... Christian: If it is filled with crap I don't need to hear it.\n\nListen up!\n\n"The Kursk offensive is proving to be an incredible succes. The last three days have cost the Soviet army a staggering number of 862 tanks. The red airforce also had huge losses. Numbers of aircraft confirmed to be destroyed is 847 aircraft.\n\nThis due to an for the Soviets unforseen and highly aggressive German counterattack rapidly succeeded by an all-out Russian attempt to recapture a number of tactical staging areas between Belgorod and Orel.\n\nThe immense pressure on the Soviet army caused by the superior trained and equipped German army caused the Soviets to throw in all available Soviet reserves that had build up the past couple of weeks.\n\nThis however caused a counter reaction for our own commanders that were forced to deploy their own reserves.\n\nResulting in a enormous clash of armour and men. However the biggest in menn and material has been suffered by the Soviets."\n\n... Christian: Is this a moral pusher or bummer?\n\nYou decide!\n \nBut first you are ordered to patrol the Rzhavets area.\nIt has been a common target for fighter bombers the last couple of hours.\n\n... Alex: What are they targetting?\n\nWe are trying to build up a Panzer formation to smash through the Soviet Eastern flank.\nHowever this has not gone unnoticed and since last morning three attempts to raid the area have heavily damaged the small town.\n\nJust make sure not one enemy fighter gets through!\n\nDismissed!\n\n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n
