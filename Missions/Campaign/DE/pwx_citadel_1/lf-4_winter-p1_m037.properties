Description ###############################\ndate : 15 / 1 / 1943\ntime : 09:00\nweater : Clear\n###############################\n\nGentlemen,\n\nCongratulations with the excellent job you did.\nI am very satisfied about it, and so is high command.\n\nThey took us by surprise but not a nasty one.\nEven though they launched an incredible amount of bombers not even one reached base.\n\nThis due something I have seen before but never in such a good way.\nThis is called teamwork.\n\nOutstanding job.\n\nSome of you did that great I would like to recommend you for a medal.\n\nMentjovski, Christian great work 7 kills!!\nHaubner, Reiner, superb 6 kills!!\n\nDrache, Michael, though you are young and inexperienced you showed great courage and skills. I promise you that if you won't get killed you might become Germany's leading ace one day.\n\nAnd you too, excellent job.\nA medal is more than justified here.\n\n-- Me sir?\n\nYes you, great job.\n\nAllright, listen up men.\n\nThe attack we sustained last morning was launched from an enemy base somewhere nearby.\n\nIts up to you to find out wherefrom.\n\nTherefore you are ordered to patrol the area at great height. Cruise altitude of 5km.\n\nWith about eight kites we hope to lure in some yaks or other things you need to shoot down.\n\nYour kites are refilled and rearmed again.\n\nAny questions?\n\n** Mentjovski, but sir what if we know where from they came?\n\nSimple, tell me.\n\n** Drache, but what if we don't know where they came from?\n\nThen its your fault!\nHowever, you can if one tries to disengage and heads home let him go.\nFollow him from a distance and try to find out where he heads.\n\nBut when you do this you should be really cautious.\nThey can easily bring up some more aircraft to hunt you down.\n\nOr, if he gets your intentions he will definetly not lead you to his base.\n\nDismissed\n
