Christian: When looking out of the window the morning ain't that good.\n\nNo indeed., more mudd, more delay.\n\nAs a matter to make things worse the Soviets have opened the day and have started an air offensive behind our lines to weaken the flow of supplies to the front.\n\nShakhovo we have pounded only a few days a go is now in our posession and filled up with the tanks from an SS division.\n\nReason enough for the Soviets to pound it.\n\nWe repelled one IL2 attack. Up to you to go up and make sure no enemy fighter or bomber get's through.\n\nGood luck!\n \n \n \nYesterday's statistics: \n##########################\nEnemy kills : 260\nLosses : 18\n##########################\n \n \n \n \n \n  Your flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n
