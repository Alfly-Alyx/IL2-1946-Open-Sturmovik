You could enjoy a good long night of sleep.\n\n.. Christian : Yeah we could, but I got tired of the transports flying over us during the night.\n\nBy the way I have yesterday's statistics. \n \nYesterday's statistics: \n##########################\nEnemy kills : 9\nLosses : 4\n##########################\n \nFor now we  will escort our Schlachtflieger towards enemy targets near Shljahovo.  Recon has pictured large formations of enemy tanks at the site.\n\nExpected is that enemy will appear in large numbers to repell us. They have done that more often the last couple of times.\n\nGood Luck.\n \n \n \n  Your flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n
