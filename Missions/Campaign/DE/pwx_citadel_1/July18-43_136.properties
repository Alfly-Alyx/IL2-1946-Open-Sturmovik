Christian: Sir, yesterday I withnessed an interogation of a Soviet POW.\n\nYes and?\n\n... Christian: Well, is it true we have lost more than a 240 Tiger tanks?\n\nA big no, we don't even have that many Tiger tanks in this sector. Second the Soviets consider nearly every tank we have as a Tiger. Third the way the Soviets count their victories is highly innacurate. Sometimes when three AT guns open fire at a single Panzer III and they manage to destroy it they each count it as a kill. This because they all opened fire upon that tank.\n\nLike I said before the Soviets call almost every German as a Tiger tank. So the Soviet log tells that each of the three AT guns has destroyed a Tiger tank.\n\n... Alex: And so, do the Soviets do the same in the air?\n\nAs far as I know yes. In regard to what aircraft I don't know. Maybe they will stick to the actual plane type here. But kills are recorded different than our Luftwaffe does.\n\n... Christian: And what's their method of kill counts?\n\nAs far as I have been told is that when five Yak's jump upon a single Bf 109 and get involved in a dogfight with it. Thus a very unequal number. One 109 vs five Yak's and the Yak's shoot down the Bf 109 each of the pilot get's a kill added to its record. So the actual number of German planes downed remained one while the Soviet kill rate rises with five.\n \nOkay enough chats for now.\n\nWe have orders to patroll the tank battle between Rzhavets and Korocha. We have been informed about a possible raid between one and two o clock.\n\nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n
