A reasonable succesful day.\n\nArmee Group South has penetrated the Soviet lines and advanced about sixteen Kilometres into Soviet territory.\n\nWe have just received a message from informants behind the Soviet lines about a Soviet artillery position that is being prepared for action.\n\nThey have given us the coordinates of the artillery and they promised to set up some beacons along the route to indicate the direction.\n\nWe can't verify the reliability of these informants but we have to rely on our intuition in regard what to do with this information.\n\nCommand has decided to give it a try and trust these informant in case they are right.\n\nIf yes they could be of great value to us and we should not disapoint them this time because that could make them to decide to turn against us.\n\nWe do send in you guys just to make sure that if the enemy shows up you will be there to repel any enemy fighter that appears.\n\nGood luck.\n \n \n  Your flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n
