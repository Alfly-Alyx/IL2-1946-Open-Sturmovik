Steffen: Read aloud sir!\n\nI"A successful German infantry attack in the Byelgorod area has led to very powerfull counter attacks by the Soviets. The fighting is slowly moving towards the Kursk area and is increasing in intensity by the hour."\n\n... Christian: That ain't big news sir. We knew that already.\n\nYeah but it is a newspaper isn't it.\n\nBut I can tell you that the number of Soviet tanks destroyed already exceeded a 1000 while our losses in tanks remain below 100. \n\n... Alex: impressive!\n\nYes it is.\n \nYour actions have certainly contributed to that btw.\n\nAllright time to improve the score and set out again.\n\nTarget: enemy tanks and supplies located at Vjazoyoe.\n\nA small group of attack planes is heading towards the town and will attempt to demolish as many as possible while your task is to protect them.\n\nGood luck\n \n  Your flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n
