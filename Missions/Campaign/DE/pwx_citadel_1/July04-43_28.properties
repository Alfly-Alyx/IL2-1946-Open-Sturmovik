We guess it are fighter bombers trying to get in and out in no time.\n\nWe have had the luck that we are informed about this raid but last afternoon we were not and the damage caused by these raiders was substantial.\n\nTherefore it is of utter essence these guys are stopped in their tracks.\n\nDismissed! \n  \n \nYour flight : \n#############\n0 Alex Schneider \n1 Christian Mentjovski \n2 Michael Von Wald \n3 Steffen H\u00F6hmann \n4 Peter Dierkes \n5 Walther Wagner \n6 Udo Maus \n7 Miroslav Meister \n8 Anton Schneider \n9 Manfred Baumann \n10 Ernst Lehmann \n11 Michael Kadinsky \n
