Short Fighter Catapult Ship 'HMS Maplin' - 2\n
Description Fighter Catapult Ship 'HMS Maplin'.\nAtlantic Ocean - 450 miles southwest of Land's End.\n\nSunday 3 August 1941. 1515 hours. \nWeather - clear.\n\n\nAfter escorting convoy OG70 towards Gibraltar HMS Maplin and three destroyers - HMS St Albans, HMS Campbeltown and HMS Wanderer - are now heading southwest to rendezvous with convoy SL81, homeward bound from Freetown, Sierra Leone.\n\nJust over an hour ago a Fw200 Condor was spotted to the south. He kept his distance but our presence must have alerted him that there is a convoy nearby, and in all probability he was acting as lookout for a group of U-boats. A few minutes ago this Condor headed off, but his replacement has appeared behind us. This one is about ten miles astern, heading south at a low altitude.\n\nHe might be coming in to attack, but even if not this is a chance to deprive the U-boats of their contact patrol that is too good to miss.\n\n\n* As you are fired off the deck the Condor is at your five o'clock, at long range.\n
