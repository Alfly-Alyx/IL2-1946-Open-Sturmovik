Name Hurricat 8
Short CAM ship 'Empire Morn'\n
Description CAM ship 'Empire Morn'.\nBarents Sea - 230 miles north of Archangel.\nConvoy PQ18: Loch Ewe to Archangel.\n\nFriday 18 September 1942. 1150 hours. \nWeather - overcast; cloudbase - 2,000 feet.\n\n\nThe biggest convoy to sail to Russia yet, with the largest escort. After the disaster of PQ17 what else could we expect? Eighteen destroyers, the anti-aircraft cruiser HMS Scylla and an escort carrier, HMS Avenger.\n\nIt hasn't really helped though. Ten ships, a quarter of the convoy, have been sunk so far despite Avenger's Hurricanes and Swordfish. And now they are gone. The escort have turned back to protect QP14 and the Hurricat is now all the air cover that we have. Our remaining escorts have been reinforced by four Russian destroyers, but it still isn't great.\n\nHeading south for Archangel, through the snow flurries, we have once again come within the bombers' range. Already today Ju88s and He111s have attacked, fortunately hitting just one ship. Now there are more: at least fifteen have been picked up on radar, approaching from the north-east. Try and get amongst them before they can launch their torpedoes.\n\nWhen the area is clear head down to Keg Ostrov airfield - it will be a lot better than getting an icy soaking, and for once we could save the aeroplane.\n\n\n* Empire Morn is the rear ship in the fifth column.\n* Vayenga-1 substitutes for Keg Ostrov, as does Murmansk for Archangel!\n* Skin: Hurricat_NJL\t\t\t\tMarkings: OFF\n
