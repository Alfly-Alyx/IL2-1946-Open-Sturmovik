Name Hurricat 5
Short CAM Ship 'Empire Morn'\n
Description CAM Ship 'Empire Morn'.\nBarents Sea - west of Bear Island, 400 miles north of Norway.\nConvoy QP12: Murmansk to Reykjav\u00EDk.\n\nMonday 25 May 1942. 0855 hours. \nWeather - dry but heavy clouds at 1,500 feet.\n\n\nAfter the bad weather of the last two days the sky is clearing. This is, unfortunately, not in our favour and it didn't take the Luftwaffe long to find us.\n\nA Blohm & Voss Bv138 flying boat arrived early this morning, joined about an hour later by the inevitable Condor. Then about twenty minutes ago a couple of Ju88s turned up. While the other two are circling the Junkers are looking for an opening to attack the convoy, so it's been decided that this is enough of a threat to launch the Hurricat.\n\nThree of them are well to the rear of the convoy, whilst one of the Ju88s has just disappeared into the clouds ahead. Hopefully they might not notice the flames as the catapult is fired.\n\n\n\n\n* Empire Morn is leading the right-hand column.\n* Skin: Hurricat_NJL\t\t\t\tMarkings: OFF.\n
