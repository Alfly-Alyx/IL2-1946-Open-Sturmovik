Name Hurricat 11
Short CAM ship 'Empire Tide'\n
Description CAM ship 'Empire Tide'.\nAtlantic Ocean - 800 miles west of Bordeaux.\nConvoy: SL133 Gibraltar to Liverpool.\n\nSunday 28 July 1943. 2037 hours. \nWeather - good with scattered cloud at 3,000 feet.\n\n\nYour oppo from Empire Darwin has disrupted the attackers, but he's out of ammo and has bailed out ahead of the convoy. One of the sloops is off to pick him up. \n\nThe Liberator shot down the aircraft that he was chasing, but the last we heard from the Americans was a SOS signal, so it appears that they've gone in too. There's not much hope of finding them I'm afraid.\n\n\nThere are still more Condors coming in though, so now it's your turn. The aircraft that you're after is dead ahead of the convoy, coming in low, but there are others around. Mostly they appear to be staying up high, between 9,000 and 12,000 feet.\n\n\n\n* Empire Tide is the lead ship in the left-hand column.\n* Skin: Hurricat_LUY\t\t\t\tMarkings: OFF\n
