Short CAM ship 'Empire Darwin'\n
Description CAM ship 'Empire Darwin'.\nAtlantic Ocean - 800 miles west of Bordeaux.\nConvoy: SL133 Gibraltar to Liverpool.\n\nSunday 28 July 1943. 1938 hours. \nWeather - good with scattered cloud at 3,000 feet.\n\n\nLast winter was very quiet as far as Luftwaffe anti-shipping operations went. However, the Condors have returned to the Atlantic coast this Spring and it seems that they have new orders. They tend to attack en masse, and very seldom come down low unless they feel that there is a good opportunity for success.\n\nFrom the Allied point of view the increasing number of escort carriers means that the CAM ships are no longer required, and the MSFU was disbanded on 15 July. This convoy includes the last two CAM ships in service, on their final voyage home.\n\n\nRadio messages are coming in that a Gibraltar-bound convoy, 120 miles north-east of here, is under attack from at least eight Condors. They have no air cover and at least one ship has been sunk. We are lucky to have been reinforced by the anti-aircraft cruiser HMS Scylla and her destroyer group, and must be considered comparatively well-protected against air attack.\n\n\nThe Condors have arrived. The first one was spotted off to starboard. Coincidentally a USAAF B-24 Liberator popped up at the same time and is chasing it down. Two more Condors have been spotted coming in from the North at high altitude, but we're more worried about another that is coming in fast and low from west-north-west. It's about six miles out as you are launched.\n\n\n* Empire Darwin is the lead ship in the right-hand column.\n
