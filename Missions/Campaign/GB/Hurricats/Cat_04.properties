Name Hurricat 4
Short CAM Ship 'Empire Foam'\n
Description CAM Ship 'Empire Foam'.\nNorth Atlantic Ocean - 550 miles west of Ireland.\nConvoy HX156: Halifax to Liverpool.\n\nSaturday 1 November 1941. 1505 hours. \nWeather - overcast; cloudbase - 3,250 feet.\n\n\nEarlier this morning one of our escort destroyers - HMS Buxton -  had a narrow escape, being missed by a salvo of six torpedoes. It is to be hoped that the resulting counter-attack has shaken off our pursuers, but the appearance of a Condor dead ahead is a bad sign. We must try and shoot it down before it signals to the wolfpack.\n\nIf we don't then we can expect more tragedies like the one yesterday morning. Before our Royal Navy escort arrived last night we were accompanied by the US Navy; in the early hours the destroyer USS Reuben James was torpedoed by a U-boat, exploding and sinking with a large part of her crew.\n\nWhat repercussions the sinking of a neutral warship will have we shall have to wait and see.\n\n\n\n\n* Empire Foam is the lead ship in the sixth column.\n* Skin: Hurricat_LUY        Markings: OFF\n
