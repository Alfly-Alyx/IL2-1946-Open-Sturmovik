It was decided not to launch as they showed no sign of attacking.\n\nEarly this morning another one appeared. Again he didn't attack, just circled around and around the convoy, watching us. He is going out of sight in a southerly direction, but there is a commotion at the rear of the line; ships are reporting another Condor coming in fast and low.\n\nThis one is definitely attacking - get going!\n\n\n\n\n\n* Maplin is the lead ship in the second column.\n* Skin: Hurricat_nm  \t             Markings: OFF\n
