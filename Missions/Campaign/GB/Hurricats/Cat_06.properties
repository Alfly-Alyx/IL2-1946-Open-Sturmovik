Name Hurricat 06
Short CAM ship 'Empire Lawrence'\n
Description CAM Ship 'Empire Lawrence'.\nBarents Sea -  west of Bear Island, 400 miles north of Norway.\nConvoy PQ16: Reykjav\u00EDk to Murmansk.\n\nMonday 25 May 1942. 1848 hours. \nWeather - good with a few clouds at 4,000 feet.\n\n\nThe weather has really cleared up today. At this time of year it is to be expected, but it means that at these northerly latitudes it will be light for most of the night as well as during the day. Ideal for the Luftwaffe.\n\nA few hours ago we passed the homeward bound convoy QP12; it seems that they have had some success with their Hurricat. Of course they will have no further fighter protection if they are attacked again. It seems likely that it will be our turn next though, as this is the largest convoy assembled for the Murmansk run so far. We are important enough for us to have a four-cruiser escort for a while - that should give the Jerries something to think about if they come nosing around!\n\n\nThey have come nosing around! A few minutes ago half a dozen Ju88s made a surprise attack from 6,000 feet. These things are always well organised, the torpedo-bombers will be next. Ah yes, there they are, five of them dead ahead and closing fast. Let's give them a bloody nose!\n\n\n* Empire Lawrence is leading the left-hand column.\n* Skin: Hurricat_LUY\t\t\t\tMarkings: OFF\n
