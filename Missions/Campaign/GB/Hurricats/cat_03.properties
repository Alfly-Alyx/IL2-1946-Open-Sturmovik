Short Fighter Catapult Ship 'HMS Maplin' - 3\n\n
Description Fighter Catapult Ship 'HMS Maplin'.\nAtlantic Ocean - 100 miles southwest of Ireland.\nConvoy HG72: Gibraltar to Liverpool.\n\nSunday 14 September 1941. 1201 hours. \nWeather - overcast; cloudbase - 1800 feet.\n\n\nWe left Gibraltar twelve days ago and this convoy has had no incidents - until now.\n\nA quarter of an hour ago an unidentified aircraft was spotted stooging around to the North. Because it kept flitting in and out of the clouds it hasn't been possible to get a positive identification until a couple of minutes ago. It's been confirmed as a Condor and the decision has been taken to launch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n* Maplin is the lead ship in the right-hand column of the convoy, and the bandit is at your two o'clock. Be quick, he appears to be attacking.\n
