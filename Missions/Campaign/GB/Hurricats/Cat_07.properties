Short CAM ship 'Empire Moon'\n
Description CAM ship 'Empire Moon'.\nAtlantic Ocean.\nConvoy HG84: Gibraltar to Liverpool.\n\nSunday 14 June 1942. 1341 hours. \nWeather - poor; cloudbase - 2,000 to 3,000 feet.\n\nThings have changed in the Atlantic Ocean. We don't see many Condors attempting to bomb convoys any more, they are concentrating on co-operating with the U-boat wolfpacks. The Fw200 is now an elusive target, keeping well out of range and popping in and out of the clouds.\n\nAlso we have an excellent Escort Group, the 36th, led by Captain F.J. 'Johnnie' Walker who is fast gaining a reputation as a U-boat killer. He is with us on this trip, although his group is down to just four escorts; a sloop and three corvettes. They are going to have their work cut out!\n\nAfter losing all of our shadows for forty-eight hours another Condor seems to have found us. Captain Walker wants you to drive it off before it can send too many messages. Head round to bearing 170\u00B0 and you should see it.\n\n\n\n\n* Empire Moon is leading the port outer column.\n
