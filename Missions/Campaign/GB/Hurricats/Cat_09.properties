Short CAM ship 'Empire Heath'\n
Description CAM ship 'Empire Heath'.\nAtlantic Ocean - 250 miles west of Cape Finisterre.\nConvoy: Gibraltar to Liverpool.\n\nSunday 1 November 1942. 1104 hours. \nWeather - perfect.\n\n\nIn May of this year there were twenty-nine CAM ships in operation. However, in July they were withdrawn from the North Atlantic then in September from the Arctic convoys. The advent of the escort carrier is making us redundant; there are only eight CAM ships working now, all earmarked for the Gibraltar run. \n\nThe invasion of North Africa is imminent, thus we have a limited escort. Luckily the Condors are becoming scarce as well.\n\nNevertheless we have had warning of an air attack for an hour now, and finally a Condor has shown itself. It began their normal routine of circling the convoy, but has suddenly decided to attack, and it looks like the target is us!\nHe is on a bearing of 220\u00B0, about four miles out and closing. Prepare to launch!\n\n\n* Empire Heath is the rear ship in the right-hand column.\n
