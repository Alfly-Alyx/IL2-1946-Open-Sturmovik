Short Defend the retreating troops at Dunkirk\n
Description Righto lads. This is to be our final sweep before we leave for England. We've more than done our share and it's time for those loafers back home to pick up the slack. \n\nWe'll take off, head south at low level over the port to reassure the lads down there that the RAF is doing its part, then turn inland. Our cruising altitude will be Angels 5000. \nChrist knows what's up there but no doubt we'll run into something.\nOnce we've completed our patrol we're going to refuel, grab as much kit as we can stuff into these birds and then head home. Ground personnel are already making their way towards the port.\n\nIn the event you are shot down or have engine trouble, get as near the port or beach as you can or you'll stand no chance of getting back to Blighty. And don't count on a friendly reception from our troops either - apparently some of our blokes who've ditched on the beach have had a rough time of it. The infantry feel we're not doing enough to protect them. Can't say I blame them though, poor bastards. I can't wait to get out of this ruddy smoke - haven't seen the sun for days!\n\nFinally, without getting too maudlin, let me just say that you've held up magnificently, men, and I am proud to have had the honour of leading you. Let's bag a few final Jerries before we say farewell to France. We've left a lot of good men behind already. Let's not leave anymore. And remember - this is not the end. It's not even the beginning of the end. It's just the last bit of the beginning. \n\nI say, Pat! You should definitely send that to your chum in Whitehall! Dashed catchy, that.\n\nThank you, thank you. Anyway, we have work to do. Let's get on with it. Good luck, and I hope to see you all, hale and hearty, back in England. That's it.\n\n\n\n\n
