Description Gidday Bill. Not a bad sort of day really, is it?\n\nTrue enough Sir- uh Pat, sorry. Could do without the war but aside from that minor quibble, yes, not a bad day. Who are you writing to THIS time?\n\nOh, just the wife and our wee one, as usual. Anyway, how's today's hangover?\n\nDon't know what you mean, sir. I was in bed by 10.\n\nTrue, true. Not yours though, was it? \n\nWell, I .... bloody Secundus told you didn't he? The swine!That's the last time I shout him a drink. Probably told the whole squadron, I wager.\n\nNooo, I think they worked it out for themselves when they spotted you disappearing upstairs with Emmanuelle over your shoulder. Subtle, by the way. I can see the Froggies will have to revise their opinion of British sophisti.... Buggar it. I bet that's Ops calling!\n\n--------------------------\n\nAlright 'A' Flight, that was Ops on the phone. Air HQ radar in Reims reports a number of contacts crossing the German/French border. In our sector we have three contacts heading west at Angels 3. \n\nAircraft type unknown but we can probably assume them to be reconnaissance aircraft or bombers as the 109's don't come this far into French territory usually. We'll take a circular course north of here and see what we run into.\n\nIf you spot them, call them out. We'll climb to find a favourable position and then attack in aircraft line astern. New chap, Melchitt, - remember to hold your fire until you are within optimal range to maximise the Brownings' hitting power. \nAttack on my command -  we'll go after one plane at a time. Better one confirmed kill than a handful of "damaged" or "probables".\n\nRight. Let's get on with it.\n------------------------------\n\n
