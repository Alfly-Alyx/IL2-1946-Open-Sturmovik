Short Retreat from Pontavert\n
Description Right you blokes. I got through to HQ finally. They've had to move twice to avoid running into Jerry. We're packing it in and moving to Dunkirk to supervise the evacuation.\n\nThe evacuation of who?\n\nOf us.The BEF. We lost. We've given up. We're going home.\n\nYou can't be serious?! What about the Frogs?And Belgium?\n\nHigh Command has decided this battle is unwinnable and therefore the entire BEF is being withdrawn to prepare for the upcoming defence of Britain.\n\nMy god. Running away. The Germans will take the whole lot.\n\nOrders are orders, fellas. I don't like it any more than you do. We'll refuel then set out to Dunkirk. sounds like the whole army is already there or on the way. No more Trappist Ales for a while, eh. Let's hope we run into a few more of the lads when we get there.\n\n\n
