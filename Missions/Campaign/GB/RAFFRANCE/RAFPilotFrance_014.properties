Description ...news about C.W. Any of the hospitals report an annoying bloody Yank?\n\nAfraid not, Pat. He's still listed as missing and none of the hospitals I checked had anybody matching his description. Still, I expect he'll turn up soon.\n\nLet's hope so, Andy. Let's hope so. Anyway, call the other lads in and we'll get started.\n\n----------------------------\nWell chaps, the mobile RDF sets must actually be working for a change. Based on their information, Wing is plotting a large fomation coming our way. This time we'll try and bloody their noses before they cross into France. They'll probably be heading for airfields and railway junctions like they did in Poland. Any disruption they can cause will help them when they launch their Blitzkrieg or whatever it they call it. Not on our watch, eh, boys!\n\nGet airborne and head northeast for Luxembourg. "B' flight are already up and are being diverted to meet us. Angels 4, all out climb till we reach it. They're moving fast.\n\nThat'll be all, gents. Dismissed.\n
