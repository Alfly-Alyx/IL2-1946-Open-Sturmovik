Description SELECT HIGHEST RANK.\n\nSWITCH OFF MAP ICONS. \n\n 'TOGGLE' ICONS \n\n ----------------------\nSquadron Leader Wilson reporting for duty, sir. \n\n Ah, Pat. Jolly good, jolly good. Do sit, old man.\n Now then, I assume you have heard about poor old Wilkie so I'll cut straight to the chase. Since his dashed accident the squadron's morale has dropped noticeably. With the real war hanging over us this is something we cannot tolerate. That's why you are here - to take over, rebuild the men's morale and get them back into peak fighting condition. \n We don't have long before the bloody Hun tries to come across the border so get started straight away. \n\n Like all the Hurricane units attached to the AAF your squadron is a mobile one. Currently they are at a charming, somewhat 'rustic' aerodrome which goes by the name of Bar-le-Duc, or Barley Duck as it tends to be known, but you can expect to be hopping about the place fairly regularly to support the Blenheims and battles, as well as to liase with our French Allies. \n\n You'll know a good number of the chaps from your time at the squadron before you went to the Air Ministry but there'll also be a number of new faces being fed in who'll need to be merged into the unit and brought up to operational standards. \n\n That's all for now, Pat. Good luck. You'd best get cracking - the Hun is coming.
