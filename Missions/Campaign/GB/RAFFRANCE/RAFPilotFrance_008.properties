Name RAF Pilot France
Short New pilots\n
Description Pat. There's a young German pilot here to see you.\n\nWell bloody well shoot him. I'm just about to have a beer.\n\nI can't Pat. Says he's reporting for duty.\n\nWell tell him to buggar off, then. JG2 are across the border. In case you've forgotten, this is the R.A.-fucking F. You may have noticed the blue uniforms and the distinct lack of swastikas about the place?\n\nYes, yes. Thing is Pat, he's on our side. Got the papers and everything. Said his family moved to England when Adolf and his crowd took over.\n\nAlright then. Admirable behaviour I suppose. Show him in. What's his name, anyway?\n\nBingel. And it's not 'him', it's "Them", Pat.\n\nEh? I haven't even started this beer you know and already you're making no sense at all.\n\n"Them". There's a pair of brothers who are also joining our unit. \n\nRight. And they're Jerries too I suppose?\n\nWell their last name's Ploughman, so I'm assuming not. Andy and Marcus, to be precise.\n\n-Pat! Secundus calling from Wing! Says there's a Jerry overhead!\n\nTell him there's one here, too! Okay, okay. I'll go up after him. Which way's he headed?\n\nSouthwest - making for Nancy it looks like. Damned high - estimate Angels 5.\n\nRighto. I'll go. Atkins - get the new chaps sorted out will you? And keep them off active duty till they're more experienced. And I expect that beer to be exactly as I left it when I return. If Belgium falls it may be the last one I get for quite some time.\n
