Short Head over to Nancy\n
Description ...solutely slap-up spread last night, eh? Nothing like food fresh from the farm - especially when you have someone of Mme. Didier's skill in the kitchen. \n \nOh, rather! Simply wizard night all round,  old chap! We simply must repay the favour. Perhaps we could stroll over to the farmhouse this evening with a few bottles of Rochefort for Monsieur? \n \nGood idea, Hugh. I'll see if we can't lay our hands on some spare silk for his missus, too, eh? God knows we've worn out a fair few parachutes between us all so far! \n \nYes, quite. I say, did you see the filthy look on Secundus' face last night when he finally dragged himself in? Priceless! Apparently the poor fellow had been hit by the rear gunner of that Dornier he brought down, crashed his kite in the same field as the Jerry then leapt out and wrestled the bally pilot to the ground as he tried to escape! And then some French farmer wandered over and started taking potshots at the pair of them! By all accounts Smith's knowledge of the vernacular soon put a stop to that. He was absolutely bloody by the time he got back here though!\n \nWell speak of the devil. Here comes the man himself, along with the rest of the boys.  Best get on with the briefing I suppose. \n----------------\n Attention men. Today we've been given the task of providing an escort for some French ammo transporters - Wibaults. They're bringing much needed ammo forward and will be prime targets if Jerry spots them. This morning we're going to transfer over to  their base near Nancy , see if we can't nab a spot of lunch and this arvo we'll cover them on their way north. Keep an eye out for them en route. They look damned similar to the German Junker's 52. \nAlso, and this is important, keep your eyes open around known ack-ack sites. With the new sky blue paintscheme on the undersurfaces that good old Kristorf applied for us they're even more likely to mistake us for Jerry but at least we won't look like a bloody chessboard anymore!\n Righto. That'll do us, I reckon. Off to Nancy we go. Oh for heaven's sake, stop giggling, you halfwits!\n\n\n\n
