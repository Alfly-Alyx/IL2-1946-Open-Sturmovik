Description Well Pat, still writing, I see.\n\nHello there, Howlett me old mate. Yes indeed, just dashing off a quick note to Joan and Lucy. I'll be finished in a sec. What say we stand down after that?Don't imagine much'll be happening in this gloom. I think it's time for yet another visit to out friendly local farmer's house this evening, eh? He may have built his farmhouse in exactly the wrong position but you can't fault his hospitality. Besides, it'll give us a chance to get out of these freezing bloody tents. Wouldn't mind being billeted in the chateau right now, either. Just our luck to be kicked out by a Staff Section. I hope they suffocate to death under their feather quilts, the jammy sods. Right, that's the letter done. Why don't we jump in the car and ...Blast! There's the phone! It can't be Wing - not at this time of day.\n\nPat! Wing on the line. Scramble "A' flight, head to Metz. Looks like Jerry is paying a visit. Rollins at Wing has reported 4 groups of aircraft approaching Metz from the northeast. Some of the Blenheims are up but not enough to account for the number of plots Rollins has. Of course knowing him he could just be wrong, but on the off chance he's right you'd better go and take a shufti.  Estimated altitude 2000m. Looks like Heinkels. \n\nRighto C.W. On my way! Well, chaps, you heard the man. Let's get on with it.  Once we're back let's see what wonders Madame Didiers can conjure up for us tonight at the farmhouse. I hope she's in good form because after a flight in this weather we'll be in dire need of something to revive us.  Okay, we'd best be off. Good luck lads.\n
