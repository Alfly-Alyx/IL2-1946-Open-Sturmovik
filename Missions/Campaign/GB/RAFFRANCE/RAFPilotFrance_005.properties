Short Head over to Reims, protect HQ\n
Description Morning boys. She's cooling down a bit these days, eh? Pity the poor troops who are going to be stuck in these bloody tents when winter comes. Be thankful we're billeted out in the chateau.\n\nAh, right.Now that Bill and Howler have finally chosen to grace us with their presence I'll start the briefing. \n\nFirst up, you may be interested to know that the Reds have gone and invaded Finland. No word has reached me yet on the implications of this for us but no doubt Britain and the Commonwealth won't stand back and let another minnow be swallowed up by a bully. I don't know who's worse - the Nazis or the Commies.  Anyway, I thought it best you heard from me. I'll let you know if and when I hear more. Personally I hope the Finns stick it to those bastards - up to no good if you ask me.\n\nTurning to matters at hand, this morning we're off to Reims. \n\nNo.1 Squadron are up supporting the French - probably yet another Confetti Raid, I'll wager. Never before has so much paper been dropped on the heads of so few interested people. Gosh, that's fairly catchy, isn't it? Must jot that down in my next letter to my mate in Westminister. Kind of thing he likes, being a speechwriter. But I digress... Anyway, evidently Air HQ is feeling a bit exposed so we'll be popping over to scare any bogeymen away from the precious wee darlings.\n\nBoth A and B Flights will be coming along for the ride. We may as well do this in style so let's give the neighbouring French boys at Velaine a bit of a thrill on the way and same for the staff at Air HQ. They've purloined the lovely old chateau  in the north of the town, the spoiled sods, so it makes for an easy target. Watch out for the spires of the church in the south of the town though. A French army headquarters unit is conducting manoeuvres in the field northwest of here so hopefully we can scare the pants off them, too.\n\nWe'll go in in tight formation, line abreast, echelon starboard, altitude 150metres. \nA Flight - we'll take off first and circle the field till B flight are up. Then we'll head to Reims-Champagne, buzz HQ and land in time for a spot of brekkie. \nThe Battle and Blenheim squadrons of the Advanced Air Strike Force are all based around there so the Mess should be a sight better than our own, I'd say. Any questions?\n\nNo? Splendid. Last man to Reims buys the first round tonight!\n------------------------------\n\n
