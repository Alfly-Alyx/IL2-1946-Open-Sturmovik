Name RAFPilotFrance_
Short Recce west of base.\n
Description Christ. Listen to the guns,eh mate? Wouldn't want to be carrying a rifle right now. Buggar that for a game of soldiers.\n\nIndeed, old chap. Is that the guns on the Maginot Line, do you think?\n\nDunno to be honest but it sounds closer to me. With the speed things are changing on the ground it could mean Jerry is just about to knock on the front door of the mess. No one seems to know what the hell is going on. People say the French are falling back and that our boys are withdrawing towards the coast. Doesn't sound right to me though- surely together we can hold bloody Fritz off. \n\nOne would have thought so. The politicos here certainly seem to have given up the ghost already. Maybe the poilus have been infected, too.\n\nCould be, could be...\n....\nWhat's a "poilu" when it's at home, anyway?\n\nSorry Pat. Infantryman - a soldier. \n\nRight. I see. Thought you were talking about Thomson's you-know-what after that visit to the cat house. Makes much more sense now.\n\nI'm sure it would. Anyway, shall we take a flight up to see what's going on to the west? If it is Jerry then we need to know and no-one here seems willing or able to tell us anything.\n\nExcellent suggestion, Atkins. Get a couple of the older hands together and we'll see what we can find.\n\nWill do, Pat.\n
