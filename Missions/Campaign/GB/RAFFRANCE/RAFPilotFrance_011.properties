Name RAFPilotFrance_009
Short Patrol the city.\n
Description "... still don't see why we have to be here! Nothing could be flying in this murk. At least up here above the clouds you can actually see your hand in front of your face but I doubt Jerry will be doing any reconnaissance today."\n\n"Salient points all, thank you Stokes but nonetheless, 'ours not to reason why' and all that guff. Wing said to check Troyes so we'll check Troyes. Besides, we're lunching with the French bomber boys at Chaumont - I have a mate there - so at least we should get a decent feed out of it while we 'strengthen Anglo-French ties'."\n\n"But I'm Australian! Can I be excused?"\n\n"There's never an excuse for being  Australian, Stokesy. You should know better. Okay, waypoint coming up. Maintain Angels 5. Let's see what's so ruddy special about this Frog town."
