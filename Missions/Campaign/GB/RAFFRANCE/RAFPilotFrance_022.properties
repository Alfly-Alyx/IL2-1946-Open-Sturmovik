Description I say, Pat, those Jerries we had in the mess last night weren't bad eggs, were they? Rather imagined we'd have a lot in common if things were different.\n\n Yes,know what you mean. Gerd - was it Lehnert or Freiburg, I forget? - anyway, the taller one, seemed a damned good bloke once he'd gotten over the shock of being a prisoner. Seemed a far better sort of bloke than that other one we had - what was his name? Fella that escaped? \n\nI believe his name was Jedermann.\n\nThat's the  one. Anyway, Gerd seemed altogether a different sort. Showed me some snapshots of his wee girl- lovely thing - 5 months old, he said.

We even like the...\n\n Squadron Leader Wilson! AirHQ just called. Jerry's coming in. Strong force, tally 40 single engined, estimate Angels 4, bearing 260.\n Bollocks. Righto, Andy. Ta for that. \nDid they say where they're going? \n Hard to say Sir. Looks like they're going for the French forces in Sedan.\n Well, so much for the brotherhood of man, eh, \n
