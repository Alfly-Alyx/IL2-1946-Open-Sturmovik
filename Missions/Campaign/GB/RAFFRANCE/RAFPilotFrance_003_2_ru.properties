Short \nEscort Battles on dummy run.\n
Description ...such a tragic waste. \n\nI know sir, I can hardly believe it happened myself, sir.\n\nI mean I've seen men die before- in training, even combat already - but nothing quite prepares you for something like this.\n\nThese are trying times for us all, sir.\n\nI mean, the whole two dozen! Ruined! I didn't even to get to have one measly bottle! I'll have to sneak across to Belgium again. Ahh, war is hell, eh Howler? \n\nIt seems so, sir. Still, on the bright side - the squadron has bagged its first 109's, eh?!  Now if only we can down one of the 110's we'll be dining in fine style! I assume you heard about old Ugly's offer of a dinner at Maxim's for the first pilot to bag one? Let's just hope those tinny sods at No.73 don't get in ahead of us as usual.\n\nWell considering no-one's so much as spotted one of the buggars this side of the line I don't think it'll be happening anytime soon. Still, that 109 fin does make a fetching mess decoration, doesn't it? And my wife will have told the whole neighbourhood by now, she's proud as.\nAnyway, the other lads have sloped in at last so let's get on with the briefing. \n------\nOkay pilots, today we're working in co-ordination with 12 Sq.'s Battles of the AASF again. Just a practice today. We'll be providing an escort on their dummy run over a range in Belgium. We're to rendezvous over Reims - Angels 3. From there we'll proceed north to the 'objective'. To liven things up this time, the CO has asked us to test out his pilots alertness by bouncing them before the rendezvous. Sounds a damned good chance to practise our attack formations so I've signed us all up. We'll form up over the field then set out once we've reached 2000m. Formation line astern, flights echelon starboard. Once we spot the 'bandits' I'll give the order to move into the appropriate formation but wait till my command.\n\nThat's all, men. Get to your aircraft.\n\n\n
