Description Morning you blokes,\nDamned hard to spot this bloody airfield from the air, isn't it?!  I had to make a landing at the nearby French fighter base - Velaine or some such thing- to say hello and ask for directions. Damned embarrassing even to think about it. But I mustn't be rude about our Allies. I'm sure they are a good bunch of fellows. We're already invited to their mess this Friday for a welcome do so that's a good start to our stay here.\n\nFor the few lads from the old days, damned good to be back with you- except for you Rollins, obviously you old buggar. For those newly arrived - Flight Sergeants Miller and Melchitt - welcome to one of the finest squadrons you could hope to find. I'm sure you will do your best to continue our traditions.\n Forgive me, let me introduce myself. I am Squadron Leader Patrick Wilson -  but please just call me Pat. I used to serve in this squadron before the war until I was called up to the bloody Air Ministry. When poor old Wilkie bought it I was given the tap to fly over and take charge. I am humbled and delighted to be leading you men. Together I have every confidence that we will do Wilkie proud.\n\nI'm a New Zealander, like half the rest of the bloody RAF but any Aussies, Canadians or Sprinboks amongst you please don't be too hard on yourselves - it's probably not your fault and at least you can be thankful you're not  Poms or Yanks! Sorry about that Johnnie! You too, C.W. No offence meant, lads - well, no more than usual at any rate. \nBlessedly we're a long way from the Air Ministry so we can be fairly casual around the base. If you have any questions or problems come and talk to me - you'll find I don't stand on ceremony.\n\nObviously, we are a fairly diverse group of scoundrels but we will fight as a united team. There will be no place for line-shooters and heroes. This is the RAF. We live, fly and fight together.\n\n\nRighto. Enough of the preaching. Here endeth the lesson. Time for the briefing proper.\nOld Smith "Secundus" over at Wing reports several contacts crossing the border into France from the east. No doubt it's Jerry conducting reconnaissance flights over the French defences and airfields. Our job is to put a spoke in the works.\n\nThis is our job.  We'll take off at 0700 and circle northwest over the nearby village then head towards Verdun and hope we spot the sods. Angels 4, 2 sections in  close echelon starboard. If we make contact follow my lead. We'll climb to get the jump on them and then attack in line astern. \nFor you new chaps,  hold your fire until you are within 200 yards so as to maximise your guns effectiveness. We'll do this our way, not by the bloody the book. \nAnd no split-arse nonsense - this is the RAF!\nTo your aircraft, men. Good hunting.\n\n------------------------------\
