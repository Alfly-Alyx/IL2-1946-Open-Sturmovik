Description Excusez-moi Squadron leader Wilson, \nI 'ave some good news. As you know, hier...euh..tomorrow we 'ave capured a Boche Junkers quatre-vin ...euh... eighty-eight -pardon, sorry, yesterday! Yesterday we 'ave done it. \nWe 'ave painted RAF roundels on it and aussi the yellow markings for to help recognition. We have need to take it to the capital for the inspection but every of our pilotes are very occupied in this moment so we ask you to fly 'er there.\nCan you do it?\n\nUmm..oui. Ahh...bien sir, Colonel Clouseau.\n\nFormidable! We will furnish for you an escort of Moranes to ensure that you arrive in the safety. This is a mission very importante alors it is necessary that you take no risques. Are you understanding?\n\nAbsolutely-ement, Colonel. I am understanding trays bon!\n\nBonne chance! You will have need of the luck. Fly at a low altitude so the men of the defences anti-aircraft can see the markings or else they will shoot at you in thinking you a Boche. The Boche 'imself will not be too 'appy either, I assume. \n\n'ave fun,Monsieur Wilson. I 'ope I see you again.\nBy the way, I notice you are wearing the parfum. Is that the scent of elderberries I detect? No? My mistake Monsieur.\nOh. pardon, I seem to 'ave farted in your general direction. I must leave!\n
