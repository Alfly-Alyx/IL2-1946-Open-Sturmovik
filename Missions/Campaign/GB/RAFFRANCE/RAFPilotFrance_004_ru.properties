Short Breaking in Melchitt\n
Description Gidday C.W. - sorry, I mean, "howdy". That's what you Yanks say, isn't it? Looks like nothing much is happening again today, just for a change, so I'm taking up the new chap Melchitt, get him used to how we operate. You're in charge till I get back. \n\nSure thing, boss.  I've got it covered.\n\nRight...splendid, splendid...so can I assume that means you'll do it? \n\nAbsolutely, Sir. \n\nOh good. Ta very muchly. Right! Melchitt! Let's go! We'll do a short circuit south of here. I won't hold back so make sure you stay awake and glued to my tail.\n\nYes sir. Understood.\n\nJolly good. And with any luck we'll spot a nice fat  Hun for you to cut your teeth on. Well, don't let me keep you, your kite won't pre-flight itself, you know.\nAnd C.W. - have a beer waiting for me at the Mess for when we get back, there's a good lad. See if they have any of that Trappist stuff again, Rochefort if they have it, though that Chimay stuff will do in a pinch - the blue label for preference.Still can't believe that last batch I got was thoroughly ruined by bloody Jerry! What filthy swine they are!\nRighto, mate. Shouldn't be more than an hour or so. \nCheerio.\n------------------------\n\n
