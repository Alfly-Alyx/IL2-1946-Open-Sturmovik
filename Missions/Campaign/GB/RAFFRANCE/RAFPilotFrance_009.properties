Short Brave the weather and attempt to intercept H/A.\n
Description Evening fellas. Christ, I'll never get used to these Northern Hemisphere winter evenings. It's just gone 5 o'clock  and already virtually dark.  I do not envy our boys fighting in Norway - not at all.  Hard going too, by the sounds of things. \nUnfortunately Wing have reported hostile aircraft heading in our general direction so there'll be no rest for us today. Seems they're returning to Germany.\nMe,  Miller, Howler and Secundus have drawn the short straws and will go up and see what's what.\n\nGents, check your instruments are functioning properly - we'll be needing them in this muck. Take off as soon as you can and climb full out until we're clear of the overcast.  Met reckons that'll be about 3,000metres. We'll conduct a standing patrol over Verdun and hope we make contact.\n\nWe'll have to stay alert up there boys, and not just for the enemy. Focus on your instruments,keep an eye on your orientation especially. Watch out for icing, too.Make sure you get back in one piece. It was a careless mistake in bad weather that cost good old Wilkinson his life, remember?\n
