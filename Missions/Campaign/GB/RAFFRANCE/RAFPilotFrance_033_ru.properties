Short Intercept bombers.\n
Description Attention chaps,\nThey're coming again. As per usual we're going up to intercept them before they reach the beaches. This time they're approaching from the east, estimated 50 plus bandits, angels 5. That's all we have to go on.\nWe should have support but god only knows if it really exists.\nLet's head upstairs and take a gander. We'll climb out over the beaches just to show the colours to the boys down there.\n\n
