Short Car chase!\n
Description Pat! Wait! Wait!\n\nCripes, Atkins -what's wrong?\n\nYou know that wretched bastard we thought was eavesdropping on our wireless communications? Well the MP's just went to bring him in and the sod started shooting! Two of them are down, one of them with a bullet through the skull, the poor bastard. He  evidently had some kind of incendiary  charge in place, too as the whole building burst into flame when our boys moved in ! Anyway, the spy jumped into his car and sped off. Another man was seen leaving his house on a motorbike just before our men showed up. Looks like they're both heading west - making for the forest between Pantoufle-sur-Poubelle and Salaud-le-Grand, I'd wager! Our troops piled in to a couple of lorries and are giving chase led by some of our pilots in  Rolly's ancient Bentley but they'll never catch up. What are your orders?!\n\nBastards! I was going to take this crate up to test the guns. Looks like I I'll have a real target to practise on. What car is he in?\n\nNot sure- black sedan of some kind, not too many around this area. Damned fast by all accounts.\n\nRight. Is he on the road or off it?\n\nHe's travelling along the main road - so's the chap on the bike. Get the bastards, Pat!.\n\nWill do, Atkins. Chalky! Stand clear! Chocks away! \n
