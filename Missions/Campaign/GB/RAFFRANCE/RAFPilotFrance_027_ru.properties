Short Escort friendly bombers on attack on river crossings\n
Description Right chaps. Did anyone see Marcus go in?...No? Anybody see a chute?...No? Well, let's not assume the worst just yet. More than likely the jammy bastard parachuted into a private girls' university dormitory, knowing his luck. I expect he'll turn up somewhere sooner or later. \n\nWing managed to get through and told me to say good work on the last mission. Jerry was less pleased. I have some bad news,too though. I'm afraid those bloddy bridges are still standing so a formation of Blenheims are already airborne and headed towards them to finish the job. \n\nOur task is the same as before so let's get to it.\n
