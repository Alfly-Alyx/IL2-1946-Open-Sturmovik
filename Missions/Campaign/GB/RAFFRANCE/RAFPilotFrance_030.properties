Description "...Tipperary, to the sweetest gir..."\n\n"Bloody hell Bill, you've left the RT on again!"\n\n"Oops-a-daisy. Forget me bleeding head if it wasn't screwed on.  Apologies Pat."\n\n"Tighten up lads. We should be linking up with the Blenheims in a couple of minutes so keep your eyes open. They should be at Angels 4. We'll cover them back across the front lines then return to Poncyvert."\n\n"Hope some of the poor buggars make it that far this time."\n\n"That's what we're here for. We'll stick close and keep the 109s away. Don't miss your chance to even the score for the lads they've taken though - Marcus,C.W...."\n\n"Old Joe Bilton"\n\n"Clixby over in No.1"\n\n"Bingo."\n\n"What do they expect when they send one flight up against half the flipping Luftwaffe, eh?"\n\n"Right, that'll do. That'll do.No sense going on about it. We all know the risks. How about a song there, Bill?"\n\n"Right you are, Pat. It's along way, to Tipperary..."\n\n\n\n
