Short Escort friendly bombers on attack on river crossings\n
Description Well chaps, glad you all made it. Those bloody Heinkel 112's livened my morning up, I tell you. \nGod knows how long we'll be here - I suspect it won't be long. Ah, Rollo - good to see you again. I must say you're becoming quite the expert at parachuting, eh, old boy? \nRight, well,the tactical situation at the moment can be summed up in one short rude word. Beyond that it's hard to say. All the information we receive is usually out of date, such is the speed of the German advance. The French are fighting hard by the sounds of things but Jerry seems to be slicing through the defences with amazing speed. Today at least we have a chance to directly influence the direction of the ground war. We are to escort some of our mates in the Battles as they attempt to cut all river crossings over the Meuse. \n\nThe first group went out already - not too much resistance by all accounts, thankfully. I was having a yarn to Neville over there - they've been absolutely mauled so far, the Blenheim drivers, too, poor sods.  Unfortunately there mission was not entirely successful so the lads we'll be escorting are going to try and finish it off. The Frogs are involved too. It's going to be a very crowded patch of air so we'll need to stay extra sharp. At least Jerry ack-ack should be light due to the speed of their advance.\n\nThe Battles will go for the bridges. Our job is to stay high above and keep watch for Hun fighters. The Germans are obviously going to be protecting their advances so expect trouble - again. "A' flight - this is our mission. "B' flight will relieve us over the target area and cover the next wave. We should rendezvous with the Battles at  Angels 3 over our  old digs at Barley Duck at around 9:45 but these things usually get all ballsed up so I wouldn't hold my breath. We'll circle the area once or twice if need be till they show up.\n\nRight. Let's get on with it, shall we?\n
