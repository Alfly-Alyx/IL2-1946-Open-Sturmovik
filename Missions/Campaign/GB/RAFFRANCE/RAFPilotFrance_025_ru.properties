Description Morning boys,\nWell, still no word on young Bingo I'm afraid. Miller and Melchy fought their way through the jam of refugees and convoys to check all the hospitals but to no avail, so far.  If anyone gets word of a German spy in RAF uniform make sure to let me know so I can intervene - can't have our 'good' German falling into the wrong hands - who'd believe he's in the RAF with that accent!\nThe good news though, is that Rollo turned up at last. Sauntered  in during the night, parachute slung casually over his shoulder. Poor buggar had been on foot for the best part of two days so he's practically comatose right now, plus he has  a few splinters in his arm from a 109's cannon as a souvenir of his adventures. Seemed a box of birds when I talked to him though - good lad. Anyway, drinks are on him next time, eh. Could someone remind me to tell him that.\n\nRight, this morning we're to transfer to a reserve airstrip. Jerry is getting too close to maintain this old dump. Air HQ may not like it but I'll be buggared if I'm going to stand by and let myself get captured by the Germans.\nI've already sent some of the ground crew ahead and the rest are en route or soon will  be. \nOur new home is fairly rudimentary to say the least. No chateau this time I'm afraid boys - if you're lucky you'll get to share a tent, otherwise you'll be bedding down under the stars, I'm afraid. \nIt's about 30 kilometres southwest of here,I'm told -  just a short hop and not too far from Troyes, say 20 kilometres east, if Stokesy is to be believed at any rate. It's near  a river if that's any help.\n\n'scuse me Pat. Which one?\n\nHe forgot the name. "Le something or other" were his exact words, I believe.\n\nBuggar me Pat. You're not relying on Stokesy, are you?! Things must be even worse than I thought.\n\nNow now, that's damned uncharitable of you, Johnno. Absolutely true of course, but nonetheless, unworthy of such a distinguished personage as yourself. To be honest though,  I have my doubts too. Anyway, he said it's there so we'll have to believe him. \n\nWe'll be making our way there individually to confuse any fifth columnists in the area. Stay at treetop level to further hinder their observation. \nSome elements of "B' flight should already be there by the time you arrive - that should help with identifying the patch.\n\nOne final note before we leave the dear old Duc. Our poor friends, the Didier family's headstones have been erected in the ruins of their old farm house so anyone wishing to pay their respects has my permission to do so. \n\nDismissed. With any luck I'll see you there shortly.\n
