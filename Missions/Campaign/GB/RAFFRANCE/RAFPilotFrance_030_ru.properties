You've left the bloody RT on again!"\n\n"Oops. Forget my bloody  head if it wasn't screwed on.  Apologies Pat."\n\n"It's forgotten. Right. Tighten up lads. We should be linking up with the Blenheims in a couple of minutes so keep your eyes open. They should be at Angels 4. We'll cover them back across the front lines then return to Poncyvert."\n\n"Hope some of the poor buggars make it that far this time."\n\n"That's what we're here for. We'll stick close and keep the 109s away. Don't miss your chance to even the score for the lads they've taken though - Marcus,C.W...."\n\n"Old Joe Bilton"\n\n"Clixby over in No.1"\n\n"Bingo."\n\n"What do they expect when they send one flight up against half the flipping Luftwaffe, eh?"\n\n"Right, that'll do.
