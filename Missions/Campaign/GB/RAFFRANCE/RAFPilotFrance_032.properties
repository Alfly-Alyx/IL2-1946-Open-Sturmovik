Short Defend the retreating troops at Dunkirk\n
Description Johnno, what's the gen? Anyone know what's going on?\n\nIt's not good, Pat. Jerry's knocked out our main fuel dumps, our spare parts supply is gone, most of our spare machines are written off or at least damaged and we're down to 5 fit pilots -that's including stragglers from other units - and two of them would be grounded in usual circumstances. \n\nOh, bloody hell. Hopefully some more of the lads make their way here soon.Is there any good news?\n\nThat was the good news. The bad news -  Jerry's at it again. Picket ships have spotted a handful of  Heinkels approaching from the south. They must have slipped through the cordon further out.\n\nCan't one of the squadron's from Britain get them?\n\nAfraid not - they won't be overhead for another hour or so at least. Too dark and the weather is too dodgy.\n\nWell those bombers can't be allowed to drop their bombs over the beaches - even with all the smoke over the target they're bound to hit some poor bastard. The troops are dependent on ... Christ!!! What the hell was that?! Someone's shelling us - they're damned close it looks like, too. Get airborne, men!\n
