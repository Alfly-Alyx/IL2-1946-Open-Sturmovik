Short Patrol Metz\n
Description Morning Pat. Well, looks like spring is sprung is ,eh?\n\nYou're dead right, Andy. None too soon either, I reckon. Last week reminded me of my old rugby days in the Temuka under-8s. Jesus it was cold, and the frost made it even harder when you went down as well. Don't miss that at all. Roll on spring - the weather at least, perhaps not what's coming with it.\n\nYes. Quite. I was chatting to Wickers at Wing over a pint - said Jerry's already stepped up his activities. How much longer do you think it'll be until the big match kicks off?\n\nBuggared if I know, mate. If I were a gambling man though I'd put my money on April or May. That'd allow a good long campaign season. The Lafayette lads over at Velaine seemed to think so too, last time I popped in. Jerry will need all the time he can get - attacking France will be no pushover, not like poor old Pol... oh dear. Here comes the adjutant. This won't be good news.\n\nGood morning Squadron leader Wilson.\n\nGidday mate.\n\nThis just in from Wing, sir.\n\nRighto. Thank you. Get the men together for a briefing.\n\nSir.\n\nTa.\n-------------------------------\nWell fellas, winter is on its way out and with it your life of sloth and indolence - no more long nights propping up Madame Marceau's bar, I'm afraid. Jerry has already intensified his reconnaissance flights and I think we can safely say that more will be coming. Expect to be flying all hours from here on in.\n\nToday we'll be patrolling over Metz, keeping an eye over enemy lines near the Maginot Line.  Radar indicates several flights of hostile aircraft in the region, probably twin-engined jobs. \n\nWing reports that we have nothing up there at the moment. Our Allies - who the hell knows? Communications are not all that they could be, I'm afraid. Anyway, no worries. Let's get up there and see what's what. Angels 2, speed 300 over the patrol area. Should we sight bandits follow my lead and get into attack  formation sharpish. \nKeep your eyes open and your heads moving and we'll come through just fine.\nLet's be off.\n------------------------------\n\n
