Name RAF Pilot France
Short Intercept incoming bombers.\n
Description Fellas. As you know, we're here to try and sort out some sort of liason between us and the l'armee de l'air. So far we haven't really been operating in coordination at all. That's why we're going up on a joint flight. Our goals will be to develop some understanding of each other's tactics. We've seen these boys in action enough at the soirees they've thrown for us - let's hope they're as effective in the air.\n\nWe'll take off and climb full out. The new Potez bombers are scheduled to cross the patrol area at some point as our 'enemy'. We are to work with our pals in the Dewoitines and 'bounce' them. They're a good machine - fast and high flying so they'll provide us with a good chase.\n\nShould be a merry lark and there'll be a good feed afterwards. Nonetheless, we are representing the RAF so we're going to do this right. Nice tight formation, when I give the command we move into echelon right sharpish, right? Let's get on with it!\n
