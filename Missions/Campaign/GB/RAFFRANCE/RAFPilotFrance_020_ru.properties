Short \nAttack incoming bombers.\n
Description Morning all,\nApologies for getting you up at at this ungodly hour but since you're a pack of heathens anyway I thought it only fitting. The reason for our early start is of course none other than bloody Fritz. I imagine you're now wishing you had taken it easy on the grog last night. Especially you there, Rollo. You were cutting quite a swathe on the dance floor at our welcome party, eh. These Froggie bomber lads  are nothing if not generous hosts, especially with the plonk, it must be said. Shame we're going back to Barley Duck this afternoon, really. Can't face seeing the remains of the old Didier farmhouse, poor buggars.\n\nReports indicate that a number of twin-engined aircraft is making for either us here  or at the neighbouring town. In either case, they can't be allowed to get through. \n\nEstimates put the E/A at around 3,000m approaching from the northeast. \n\n"B" Flight - you're off first. Take off and circle the field to gain altitude  "A" flight, we'll take off a few moments later. Climb full-out, Angels  3. Tight formation, planes in echelon starboard. Hold fire until you're sure of the shot.\n\nIt looks like this Phoney War is continuing to get considerably less aptly-named.\n\nGood luck fellas. Let's get on with it.\n\n\n------------------------------\n
