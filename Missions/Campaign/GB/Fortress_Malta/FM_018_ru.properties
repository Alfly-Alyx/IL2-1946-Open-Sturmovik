Description So it appears that the Eyeties are getting help from the Germans.\n\nThere had been until now only unconfirmed reports of increased German presence in Italy.\n\nNow that we have sunk a few of his precious convoys, Marshall Rommel must have felt the lack of provisions and materials.\n\nOur ships have gained more freedom of movement, as the gross of the enemy battleships have been assigned to escort duties.\n\nHowever, we are in desperate need of more and newer aircrafts.\n\nOur HQ has sent urgent requests for Spitfires and by the last events, everyone thinks we'll need them, badly.\n\nToday, you will make an armed patrol over Valletta.\n\nA few cargos have arrived during the night, apparently undetected, so we can be sure the enemy will try to damage whatever they can in the harbour.\n\nThe Ta Kali Hurricanes will be just a few miles North of your position and will be able to provide support as necessary. \n\nDismissed!\n\nSKIN: HurriMkIIb-Malta-HAA\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
