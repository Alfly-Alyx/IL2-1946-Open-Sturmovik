Name Fortress Malta
Description Italy has declared war on Britain.\n\nIt is quite weird to consider the Italians as enemies, all of a sudden.\n\nNevertheless, despite the sympathy between Italians and the Maltese people, there is no space for personal feelings. We are at war.\n\nThe situation is critical, since there are only four Sea-Gladiators at the Hal-Far airfield to defend the whole island.\n\nFortunately, there are many AAA batteries, which have been put on constant alert once the bad news reached us.
