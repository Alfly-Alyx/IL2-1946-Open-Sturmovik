Description Today, your Squadron will accompany a group of Wellingtons performing an attack on the Capo Passaro airfield.\n\nThe weather has worsened, but the relatively high ceiling will play in our favor.\n\nYou will fly above the cloud cover for the most part of the trip and will descend below it as soon as you'll be 'feet dry'.\n\nA couple of Spits from Luqa will be on your left flank.\n\nThere have been reports of new German units being relocated to Sicily, so you may as well meet them today.\n\nStay as close as possible to the bombers, don't let you lure away from the main formation in useless dogfights and try to come back in one piece.\n\nDismissed!\n\nAIR START!\n\nSKIN: SpitVc-Malta2-E\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
