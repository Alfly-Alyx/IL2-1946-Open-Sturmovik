Description The whole island is in high spirits.\n\nThough damaged, all the ships made it into the Grand Harbour.\n\nDespite the happy atmosphere, the job is not yet done.\n\nThe Italians will surely try to bring some damage to the unloading ships.\n\nTherefore you have been requested to make a last patrol at dusk.\n\nOur forces are thin but not yet defeated.\n\nIf we have to throw stones at the enemy, that's what we'll do.\n\nBy the way: there's plenty of rocks on the island.\n\nIf the bombers show up, make every bullet count.\n\nDismissed!\n\nSKIN: HurriMkIIb-Malta2-A\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
