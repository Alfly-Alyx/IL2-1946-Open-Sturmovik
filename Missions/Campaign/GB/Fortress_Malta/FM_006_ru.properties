Description Another raid.\n\nThis time, the Italians are trying to evade detection by flying low.\n\nAlmost no ships have reached us lately.\n\nPeople are hungry and fuel is scarce.\n\nThose planes may be torpedo bombers, trying to get some hits at the transports that came in during the night.\n\nWe must stop them before they can hit the ships, or we will have nothing left for who knows how long.\n\nSKIN: HurriMkIIb-Malta-HAA\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
