Description HQ wants to retaliate yesterday's attacks.\n\nA large Wellington formation will attack before dawn the Gela industrial facilities and harbour.\n\nWe expect lots of aircrafts in the air, mostly Italian Macchi's and some Bf110s.\n\nIt's not likely that the Bf109 boys will also be in the air, but be prepared to a fierce enemy opposition.\n\nSpitfires from Luqa and the Hal-Far Hurricanes will be level and slightly above the bombers, while your Squadron will provide top cover.\n\nThe cloud layer should not be too thick over the target and there is a full moon, so we foresee lots of action.\n\nNeedless to say that your primary concern is the protection of the bombers.\n\nDismissed!\n\nAIR START!!\n\nSKIN: SpitVc-SpitVc-Malta2-E\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
