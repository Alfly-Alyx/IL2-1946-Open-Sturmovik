Description Apparently, Hope, Faith and Charity scared the hell out of the Italians, because they haven't sent any more unescorted bombers over the Malta.\n\nThe bombardments are going on round the clock, but there is a slight chance to get some planes.\n\nIt appears that some Hurricanes, destined to join their Squadrons in the Middle East, have been diverted to Malta.\n\nThey may reach us as soon as tonight.\n\nIn the meantime, we only need to hold for few more hours.\n\nAgain, the Fort Pembroke's Bofors have started their barking.\n\nThe night is clear and the moon is helping the Italians to find their targets.\n\nFortunately, this could mean that there will be no fighter escort.\n\nWe'll see.\n\nTime to go.\n\nSKIN:\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
