Description We have almost no food left and the fuel price is probably higher than that of gold.\n\nThe Maltese people already cut down the few trees that could be found on the island. Furniture will probably be next.\n\nWe have received a handful of Hurricanes, but they will be useless pretty soon if we don't get the fuel.\n\nFlights have been limited to those necessary to fence off enemy raids.\n\nSince few days, no more recon patrols have been sent out to sea.\n\nThe morale is pretty low, but the hospitality and endurance of the local people compensates fot the lack of everything else.\n\nAgain, last night Valletta has been hit hard by some Caproni bombers.\n\nThis morning, St.Paul's Bay battery has sighted what could be a formation of Fiat Br20 bombers heading for Valletta.\n\nThe dance has started again....\n\nSKIN:HurriMkIIb-Malta-HAA\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
