Description While we were out for the intercept, some more Hurricanes have arrived at Hal-Far.\n\nThis should give the Hope, Faith and Charity some respect.\n\nNevertheless, the fuel situation is critical and the food is still scarce.\n\nIf no convoy reaches us within the next week, we may be forced to give up the island.\n\nThough we know that the Navy is making all efforts to get us food and fuel, almost everyone feels we are dangerously approaching a point of no return.\n\nConfidential intelligence reports say that help is under way.\n\nLet's hope that it will be not too late.\n\nA large enemy formation has been sighted again overflying St.Paul's bay.\n\nOnly six Hurricanes will be able to take off.\n\nSKIN: HurriMkIIb-Malta-HAA\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
