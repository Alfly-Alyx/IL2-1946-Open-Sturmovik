Description The Hurricanes landed at Luqa yesterday evening, during the raid.\n\nFortunately, the Italians had sent no fighters to escort the bombers, so the Hurri's slipped in unnoticed.\n\nThe raids continue unrelented, but now Hope, Faith and Charity are not alone anymore.\n\nYou have been assigned to lead the Hurricanes.\n\nThere are just four, but HQ is aware of the strategical importance that Malta has gained after the Italians joined the conflict.\n\nMore and more Units are being assembled to join our defence.\n\nThere are even talks about aircrafts carriers steaming at full speed to Gibraltar and further, in order to launch more planes to join our forces.\n\nBut until we get more aircrafts, we must hold on and fight.\n\nSKIN: HurriMkIIb-Malta-HAA\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
