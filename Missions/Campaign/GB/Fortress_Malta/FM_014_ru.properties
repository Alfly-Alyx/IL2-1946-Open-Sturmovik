Description Just our luck! An enemy raid exactly while the Blenheims were landing.\n\nA couple will need some patchin up, but all considered, it went rather well.\n\nThose Macchi's were the nastiest surprise of the whole affair.\n\nThe Eyeties in those Fiat CR42s were more a nuisance than a menace, but the MC200 is much faster though less manouvrable and can climb faster than a Hurri.\n\nThank goodness, their small caliber guns cannot give much of a punch.\n\nNevertheless, they're a more dangerous adversary.\n\nThe Blenheims will start today with a series of interdiction patrols to intercept German or Italian convoys.\n\nWe need to make life more difficult for the German army in North Africa and for the transports heading to Sicily at the same time.\n\nToday you will lead the escort of six Blenheims towards what seems to be a convoy on its way to North Africa in sector J4.\n\nFour Hurricanes from Ta Kali will join you on your way.\n\nIf attacked, remember not to stray too far from the bombers.\n\nDismissed!\n\nAIr START!\n\nSKIN: HurriMkIIb-Malta-HAA\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
