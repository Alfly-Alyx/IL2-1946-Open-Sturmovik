Description A group of Wellingtons sent from Egypt made it barely during the attack, though with just some minor damage.\n\nThere are more kites flying over from the Middle East.\n\nThis morning at dawn a Blenheim unit will be within range.\n\nThey have been flying at night to reduce the chances of being intercepted.\n\nThey will be running on fumes when they reach us, so it's important to give them a bit of moral support and to make sure they don't have to make diversions in case of an attack, or having to ditch.\n\nThere's no need to tell you how important those kites are for us.\n\nTake off immediately and meet the Blenheims in sector K6 and see to it that they all land at Luqa unharmed.\n\nDismissed!\n\nAIR START!\n\nSKIN: HurriMkIIb-Malta2-A\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
