Description Two submarines are returning from a mission, after sinking an Italian battleship near Capo Passero.\n\nThe Eyeties are furious and tried to sink the submarines twice. Fortunately, the subs managed to dive each time.\n\nNow they have surfaced for the approach to the harbour and HQ is sure the Italians will take the chance and try to hit them again.\n\nThe Eyeties know we are waiting for them, but they are brave (or stupid) enough to try anyway.\n\nPatrol the area immediately north-east of the harbour entrance.\n\nThe Hal Far Hurricanes will also be out there.\n\nDismissed!\n\nSKIN: SpitVc-Malta2-E\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
