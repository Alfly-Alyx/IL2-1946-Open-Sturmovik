Description For the second night in a row, an enemy twin-engine recon plane has been sighted over Valletta.\n\nBy the sound of its engines, it may be a Bf110.\n\nThe bugger is probably trying to get a glimpse of one of our submarines entering the harbour.\n\nUntil now, the Navy has eluded all interceptions and we know about a sub arriving to Malta only when we see its bearded crew celebrate at one of the local bars.\n\nTonight you will be in the air to welcome the bogey.\n\nStay at 1500 meters and try to spot the enemy against the moonlit sky.\n\nYour Spit should be able to climb fast enough to get the bugger before it heads home.\n\nDismissed!\n\nSKIN: SpitVc-Malta-2V\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
