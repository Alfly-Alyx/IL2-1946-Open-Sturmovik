Description The dance has started, it seems.\n\nStill no message from England about reinforcements.\n\nWith only four planes, what can we do?\n\nThe answer is simple: fight to the last breath.\n\nThe Italians seem to be really confident, sending unescorted bombers.\n\nOne more patrol this evening.\n\nSame pattern, same pain.\n\nPerhaps the Italians will not show up.\n\nSKIN: gladiatorMkII-Charity\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
