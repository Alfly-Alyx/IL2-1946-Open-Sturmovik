Description It is confirmed.\n\nA convoy with food, fuel and spare parts is expected within 24 hours.\n\nIt is following a Westward approach, where the distance between the enemy-controlled areas is the largest.\n\nWe need to extend the patrols on sea, to interfere with possible Italian raids.\n\nWe need that cargo too badly to have it torpedoed.\n\nThis morning at dawn, take a flight from Hal-Far to sector A-14.\n\nThe convoy is not yet in sight, but there's no harm in having some preemptive patrols in the area.\n\nSKIN: HurriMkIIb-Malta2-A\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
