Description Your tour of operations is almost over.\n\nJust a few more missions and you'll get your deserved rest.\n\nThis morning at dawn, a patroling Maryland reported three juicy German Ju52 transports and escorts trying to sneak at low altitude towards the North African coast.\n\nThe pilot succeeded in staying undetected, so the enemy is probably still unaware of the interception.\n\nTake the squadron out to sector C15 and make sure Rommel is not getting whatever is on board of those transports.\n\nA couple of Hurries will converge on the area from the South.\n\nDismissed!\n\nSKIN: SpitVc-Malta2-E\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
