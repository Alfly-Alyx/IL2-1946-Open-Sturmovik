Description For today's mission we were looking for volunteers only.\n\nHowever, since everyone volunteered, we had to make a choice.\n\nRumors have reached us that several vessels had entered the Licata harbour last night.\n\nA patroling Nomad confirmed the rumor, so we are sending torpedo Beaufighters to attack them.\n\nThe area is protected by both Eyeties and Jerries.\n\nWe will be playing in their own backyard, so this is going to be a tough one.\n\nThe whole Squadron will be out for this sortie.\n\nThe Luqa Spits will be there as well, 1000 meters above you guys.\n\nTry to stay clear of the harbour ack-ack but be prepared to engage the enemy as soon as they show up.\n\nDo not waste bullets (and fuel!) in long dogfights.\n\nThe protection of the Beau's is the primary reason for you to be there.\n\nDismissed!\n\nAIR START!!\n\nSKIN: SpitVc-Malta2-E\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
