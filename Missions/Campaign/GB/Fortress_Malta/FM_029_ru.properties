Description So, the Eyeties have set in their new Macchi's MC202.\n\nIt's getting tougher by the week.\n\nThe MC202 is a fine aircraft and can climb as fast as a Bf109, though its machine-guns have a smaller caliber.\n\nOn the other side, it can give the Spit a bad time.\n\nFortunately, the planes are not being produced at high rates and are quite sparsely deployed.\n\nWell, now back to our business.\n\nAn enemy convoy on its way to Herr Rommel has been sighted South in sector C4.\n\nWe are sending a Squadron of Maryland bombers to sink it.\n\nWe can expect they are under heavy escort, so keep your eyes peeled.\n\nA section of Hurries from Ta Kali will accompany the Marylands, while you will be higher up and keep an eye on them all.\n\nDismissed!\n\nSKIN: SpitVc-Malta2-E\nMARKINGS: OFF\n
