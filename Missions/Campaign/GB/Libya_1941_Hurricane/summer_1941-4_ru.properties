Description Gazala, North Africa. Afternoon, June 15 1941.\n\nOperation Battleaxe rolls on. So far so good. We have no news about the Halfaya Pass, but our troops have penetrated the Axis lines here in the Desert. Our spearheads are racing towards Sheferzen. And further north our troops are driving on Fort Capuzzo.\n\nThis looks promising men!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYou and your Hurribombers are to make a patrol along the axis of our advance towards Sheferzen. Your main task is recce: to spot enemy columns, and determine if they are retreating and / or sending reinforcements.\n\nAnd then: strafe them!\n\nRemember: your Hurribomber has 20mm guns, that can even knock out tanks! (Bigger ones need to be attacked from the rear, though.)\n\nGood hunting chaps!\n
