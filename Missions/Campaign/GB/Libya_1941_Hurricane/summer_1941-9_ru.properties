Description June 18 1941.\n\nOperation Battleaxe is is over, and it has been a bitter disappointment to us!\n\nAlthough the big encirclement that the Jerries played for did not materialise, we are still beaten! Still: it could be worse, eh chaps? No?\n\nOK, let me be blunt, so you realise the extent of our defeat - you won't read in the newspapers, that's for sure. We have lost some 100 tanks, either in action or by mechanical breakdown. Although our friends in the Desert Rats knocked out some 50 Jerry tanks, the enemy is now in control the battlefield. Therefore they are able to recover all disabled vehicles, Allied and Axis alike, for salvage and repair. This will make their loss pretty small, while we won't get any of our knocked out tanks back.\n\nIn terms of aircraft, we have suffered considerably as well. I don't have the precise figures available right now, but for every aircraft they have lost, we have lost three! Sad, bloody sad.\n\nWith this defeat Egypt lies wide open to invasion. What will happen next I wonder? Will they strike towards Alex and the Canal?\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe battle is over, but we still can score some points, by knocking out recovered enemy tanks, or simply disturbing their salvage operation on the former battleground.\n\nWe have had reports of the Germans using the village of Sofafi as a base for the salvaging operations. We want you to attack that place, and try knock out as many vehicles as possible!\n\nAnd, hey, watch out for roving enemy fighters!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the final mission in this campaign.
