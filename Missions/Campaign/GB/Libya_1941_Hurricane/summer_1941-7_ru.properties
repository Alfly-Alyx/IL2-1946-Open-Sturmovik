Description June 17 1941.\n\nDepressing news chaps. Our forces are pulling back.\n\nThat's the reason why you had to do that sudden evacuation early this morning. There was quite simply a possibility that your last base could be overrun by Jerry panzers.\n\nThat's why we are here, at this small improvised air strip.\n\nAt 04:30 this morning, Rommel's panzers began their advance. By 08:00 they had reached Sidi Suleiman, and now they are pushing hard towards the coast and Halfaya Pass. \n\nThe situation is very confused, but the Germans obviously hope to cut off the majority of our forces. This must not happen!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nEnemy aircraft have been strafing and bombing our retreating forces all morning. Our ground commanders are crying for protection.\n\nYou must give them that. So for once you will have to try something else than ground-pounding.\n\nWe want you to make a fighter sweep over the constantly shifting battleground. Try and stop all enemy aircraft that attack our ground troops. Alright, so your crate isn't perfect for this. The situation is desperate!\n\nChop, chop! Get airborne!\n
