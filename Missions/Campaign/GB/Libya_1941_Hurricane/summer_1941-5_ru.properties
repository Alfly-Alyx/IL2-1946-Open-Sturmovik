Description June 16 1941.\n\nOperation Battleaxe is losing a bit of steam, I'm afraid. Our armoured units need to be resupplied and reinforced - then they hopefully will be good to go again.\n\nWe have made two big penetrations, and yesterday we took Fort Capuzzo. The toughest nut to crack has been the Halfaya Pass, which is still defended by isolated Axis troops. \n\nYesterday morning our forces attacked on both sides of the escarpment. The anti-tank guns of the German and Italian defenders opened fire and within a few hours all but one light tank and one of the Matildas had been destroyed.The Cameron Highlanders initially continued their advance but were soon driven back by a detachment of German armoured cars and motorised infantry.\n\nToday the 11th Infantry Brigade will have another go at that blasted Pass.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe 11th need all the support they can get. Your task is to strafe the enemy defenders. We especially want you to target batteries with those darned 88mm guns. As mentioned: they are used with deadly effect against our tanks, and must be knocked out! \n\nTwin-engined Beaufighters will also strike the Halfaya Pass. And Tomahawks from 250 Squadron will fly as overhead protection.\n\nGood luck! \n
