Description The western border of Egypt. First half of June 1941.\n\nWell done hitting those Italian MTB's! We actually got a note with thanks from the Royal Navy.\n\nABOUT YOUR AIRCRAFT\nThe Hurricane is a low-wing monoplane, powered by a Rolls-Royce Merlin liquid-cooled V-12, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of around 500 km/h at 6,400 m. It has been modified to allow for an additional 6 lbs of supercharger boost, for five minutes, which increase engine output by nearly 250 hp, with both increase the speed and not least the climb rate.\n\nThis version, the IIc, has, as you know, a very HEAVY armament: 4 20mm Hispano cannons!\n\nThe Hurricane employs a traditional Hawker construction technique from previous biplane aircraft, with mechanically fastened, rather than welded joints. This means that the airframe is heavier than more modernly designed aircraft, but also very durable. \n\nWith its ease of maintenance, widely set landing gear and benign flying characteristics, the Hurricane is know for its reliability, easy handling and also as a good gun platform: the ideal bomber interceptor!\n\nCompared with the latest mark of the Bf109 the Hurricane IS getting a bit old, but as you will be mainly employed in ground attack this will hopefully not be a problem.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAs mentioned, we rather not use the Hurribomber in straight dog-fights. One of the roles it really can handle, however, is that of the Night Fighter. And as the Axis harass us with bombing attacks during the dark hours, you really got your work cut out for you.\n\nTonight you will go on patrol, alone, cruising to and from, trying to catch those Jerry Bombers that we know have attacked some of our installations near El Alamein.\n\nGood hunting!\n\n*************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nNote that the campaign contains two versions of this mission, and only one will be played. The pick is made by random. Even if you replay the campaign you can not be sure what you will meet - if anything! \n
