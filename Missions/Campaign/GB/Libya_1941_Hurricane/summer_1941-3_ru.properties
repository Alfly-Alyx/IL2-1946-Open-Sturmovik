Description Gazala, North Africa. June 15 1941.\n\nThis morning our new offensive has started. Code name: "Battleaxe". \n\nWe know that the Axis are pretty weak after their own advance, lacking in supplies, and some people in high places think they will break if pushed hard enough!\n\nOur main thrust is aimed at the strategic Halfaya Pass, but at the same time other detachments are attacking from further inland, moving towards the coast. With a bit of luck we might encircle many of the enemy units, German and Italian, that are now at the front, making a repeat performance of the success we had with Operation Compass!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nYou and your Hurribombers have been relocated to a small airstrip inland, closer to the front. From there your assigment is to give maximum ground support to our attacking troops.\n\nYour first mission is the participate in the breaking of the enemy positions in front of the Halfaya Pass, opening the road to the pass itself.\n\nSome Jerry tanks have been spotted. It is your task to use your potent 20mm guns to take them out! They are blocking our advance along the main road. \n
