Description Afternoon, June 16 1941.\n\nThe running battle out on our western flank, between our 7th Armoured Brigade and strong enemy armoured forces is not going well.\n\nOur tanks have had a few successful attacks against unarmoured German transport vehicles, but they have found themselves at a significant disadvantage anytime they engage the panzers themselves. \n\nThe Panzer IV's, armed with 75 mm guns with a very long range, can open fire while still well out of the short range of the 2-pounder guns found on our British tanks. And our 25-pounder artillery has been forced to withdraw. \n\nWithout our artillery to concern them, the Panzer IV and 50 mm gun armed Panzer III's can now safely close range with our units and pick off our thinly armed cruiser tanks while still remaining beyond the range of the British tank guns.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThe 7th Armoured Brigade needs help, and they need it NOW! \n\nYour task is quite simple to make a sweep over the enemy armoured spearheads, and take out as many Jerry tanks as possible!\n\nHurry! \n
