Description The western border of Egypt. Early June 1941.\n\nAs I know that you and some of the other chaps in 274 Squadron have just arrived here in Egypt, I think I must first brief you all on the general strategic situation.\n\nIn late March, soon after the arrival of the Geman Afrika Korps in Tripoli, they quickly went on the offensive which had an astonishing degree of success. By mid-April Jerry had reached as far as Sollum, Egypt, close to this point. \n\nOur sole remaining position in Libya is the heavily fortified port of Tobruk, which they have surrounded and placed under siege.\n\nDue to lack of supplies the Germans and Italian doesn't seem to be ready to resume their offensive, yet, which is lucky for us. \n\nIn the meantime we have received quite substantial reinforcements, not least tanks and new Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft.\n\nBetween us: our commander general Wavell is under very strong pressure from London to go on the offensive immediately. We have launched a small operation last month, but soon we will start a big offensive, codename "Battleaxe". \n\nIt is imperative that the area between Sollum and Derna be wrested out of Axis control. It will also give us control over several airfield and give us a chance to re-establish British air forces in this region.\n\nThere is no need to waste any more time. Crete has just fallen to the Germans, and if we wait they will only become stronger.\n\nAs you are flying a Hurricane MkIIc, a fighter-bomber variant (also called "Hurribomber") we will hold you back from more ordinary fighter assignments - something this aircraft isn't too good for anyway. It's intended to be used mainly in the ground attack role, not least due to their impressive armament of four 20 mm cannons. \n\nSo you are on a bit of stand-by until the balloon goes up.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nBut this afternoon we got something for you!\n\nSome Italian torpedo-boats have attacked some of our supply ships close to the shore. In the ensuing battle we lost two ships, and they lost two. \n\nNow the remaining torpedoboats are going full throttle back to their own side. See if you can catch them!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nDon't forget to switch skin, if you want to fly in the same camo as your wing men. Choose the following skin: "01-Malta_HurricaneIIc.bmp" by VP Media. And keep markings "On".\n
