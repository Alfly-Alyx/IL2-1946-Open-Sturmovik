Description Late afternoon, June 17 1941.\n\nThis has really turned out bad. Our ground forces are retreating towards the east. But it could get even worse!\n\nIt is obvious that Jerry aims to encircle our troops closer the the sea, around Sollum and that bloody Halfaya Pass. To slow down the German panzers and give our units there time to disengage our ground troops a hastily formed screen of armour and heavy artillery. \n\nThere is heavy fighting going on there now.\n\nAnd we must help them out, slow down the panzers. The battle is already lost, but an even bigger disaster can still be averted!\n\nAlso: the front is edging closer to our airstrip as well. We must be prepared to evacuate with short notice - again.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nIt looks like the plan with the screen to stall the panzers is working. Except in one place, in the middle of the line, where Jerry is on the verge of breaking through. If we know them, that cunning bastard Rommel will immediately reinforce this penetration if it succeeds, so it is imperative that you help plugging it!\n \nYour mission this afternoon is simple: attack those enemy units that are moving through the gap!\n\nWe must buy some desperately needed time for the units up by the coast!\n\nChop, chop! Get airborne!\n
