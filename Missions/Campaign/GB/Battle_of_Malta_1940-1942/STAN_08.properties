Short \nDefend Convoy 'Substance'\n
Description Date:23rd July. 1941 time:- 16.20\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSituation:\n\nGermany has declared war on Russia. We are no longer alone in our fight against Fascism.\n\nPerhaps this is why the raids have lessened and we have noticed less Lufwaffe presence, although the Italians still bomb Le Valletta and Grand Harbour every night.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nYou and three other fighter pilots are given orders to collect your flight bags and climb aboard a truck. The journey to Luqa airfield takes about an hour after which you are ushered into the CO's office.\n\n'We are still dreadfully short of supplies here. On the 21st a convoy codenamed 'Substance' left Gibraltar and has managed to make its way through the straits of Sicily almost unscathed.\n\nYesterday evening we received Information from inter-ops intelligence that a mixed force of enemy bombers plans to attack the convoy this evening . God only knows how they find out this stuff but it is usually correct.\n\n This is beyond the range of our Hurricanes so we are going to have to use Beaufighters in a fighter role. That is why we are asking you chaps to fly them as that is your bag, if you can fly a Gloster Gladiator, I always maintain that you can fly anything !. \n\nFollow the bearing on your flight plan and you should fly straight over the convoy\n\nConvoy 'Substance' will be right on the edge of even a Beaufighter's operational range so watch your fuel gauge carefully.\n\nYou will take off and land at Luqa airfield, the Beaufighter requires a longer runway.\n\nGood Luck Chaps, I will see you in the Mess for a swift half when you get back and then we will get you back to Ta Kali, the nigh time here is none too pleasant.'\n\n( Timeskip recommended.)\n\nyour aeroplane:-Bristol Beaufighter\n\nSkin:-01-Malta Beaufighter.bmp\n\n(semi-historical)\n
