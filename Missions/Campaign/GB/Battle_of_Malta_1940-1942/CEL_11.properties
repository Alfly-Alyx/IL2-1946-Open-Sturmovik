Short \nIntercept the me 323's\n
Description Date: 26. May 1942 - time: 07.20\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSituation:\n\nRommel has pushed us back and Tobruk is again under siege and this time the Navy lack the ships to cut Rommel's supplies effectively. It looks like it is down to us.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nThe C/O calls you into his office:-\n\nYesterday evening we received Information from inter-ops intelligence that Rommel and we are 'in the same boat', he is desperately short of supplies and so every morning 'Jerry' is flying supplies from Sicily to North Africa.\n\nThis supply route would have been beyond our operational range a few months ago.But with our new aircraft there is a chance we can can just reach them.\n\nFollow the bearing on your flight plans and you should find the transport planes, please Chaps, shoot  down a few for me, they are big lumbering things and they don't usually even shoot back.\n\nThis will be right on the edge of your operational range so watch your fuel gauges carefully and do not loiter longer than one pass, this is not a patrol but an intelligence based intercept.\n\nGood luck chaps, if the boffins have done their homework the whole operation should go like clockwork.\n\n\nyour aeroplane:-Spitfire\n\nSkin:-03-Malta SpitVc greenblue.bmp \n
