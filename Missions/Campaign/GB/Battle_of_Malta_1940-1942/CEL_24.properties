Description 15th June 1942.  13.30\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nSituation\n\nOur supply situation is becoming increasingly desperate, so much so that our AA batteries are  now only allowed to fire 12 rounds per gun per day.\n\nTwo Convoys have tried to fight their way through to Malta over the last two days.\n\nConvoy 'Harpoon' sailed from Gibraltar and consisted of five merchant ships with a heavy  Royal Navy escort. \nYesterday Italian aircraft from Sardinia sank one merchant ship and damaged the cruiser 'Liverpool' and the escorts had to turn back.\nLast night an Italian cruiser squadron supported by Italian and German aircraft damaged and disabled many of the remaining destroyer escorts.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nOur last reserves of fuel have been required for this operation. Spitfires are taking it in turns to fly standing patrols over the convoy 'Harpoon' as the surviving ships attempt to clear Pantellery.\n\nToday air attacks on the convoy  have been almost continuous.\n\nWe have many enemies, today our range is one of them and you only have enough fuel to spend a very short time over the convoy .\n\nKeep your eyes glued to your fuel gauge .\n\n(timeskip recommended)\n\nyour aeroplane:- Spitfire\n\nSkin:-02-Malta SpitVc greenblue.bmp\n\n(semi-historical)\n
