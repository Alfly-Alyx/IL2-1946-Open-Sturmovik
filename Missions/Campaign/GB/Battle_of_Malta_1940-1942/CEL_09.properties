Short \nlarge Dogfight\n
Description Date: 12. June 1941 - time: 10.45\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThe Situation\n\nMay has made our situation increasingly precariouse.\n\nThe intensity of air attacks on Malta slackened slightly, we can only guess at why...\n\nThe newspaper headlines were of the sinking of the Bismark.\n\nThe final capitulation of Greece is of extreme concern. In mid May the Germans launched a massive airborne invasion of Crete, which our Navy has just had to evacuate, with the loss of 10,000 men and many precious warships and planes.\n\nAxis control of Crete makes the supply lines from Alexandria as vulnerable as those from Gibraltar. This aside, two small convoys have got through with vital provisions and submarines have started to run the gauntlet for special requirements and personel.\n\nA new Allied offensive in North Africa faltered and now there is also concern about the safety of Egypt.\n\nWe have taken so many blows that there is a real danger that pain might start to feel like pleasure !.\n\nEarlier this month the combined carrier force of 'Ark Royal', 'Furious' and 'Victorious' flew in 120 more Hurricanes so we can put fighters  up 'in Squadron strength' over the Island for the first time since January. \n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nThe 249th and 46th Squadrons have replaced 261st Squadron who were transferred to Iraq. You remained in Malta, as you are officially a Navy pilot.\n\nThe new Hurricanes are in better repair. Your comrades are not doing too well against the 109's and there is real concern that the new Squadrons may be reduced to more tally marks on a German fighters tail.\n\nThis is not helped by the inexperience of many of the new pilots, almost half have never flown a combat operation before.\n\nMost days the Lufwaffe intersperse their bomber raids with a free ranging fighter sweep or two by their Elite fighter pilots, any Hurricanes unlucky enough to get caught in the air usually get butchered.\n\nToday the C/O has a plan. The radar boys are to be especially vigilant and when they identify a smaller, faster or otherwise uncharacteristic (of bombers) concentration of planes, you and the veterans of your squadron will Scramble and climb with full boost as high as possible with the express purpose of getting above and then shooting down those bf109's.\n\nNeedless to say your squadron are not overjoyed by the 'Great honour' of this mission.\n\n+++++The telephone rings++++++\n\nRadar report a small formation of unidentified planes flying very fast from the direction of Pantellery on a current bearing that will take then down the central spine of the Island.\n\nSCRAMBLE !\n\nGet to you Hurricanes and get as high as possible and remember always watch for the Hun in the Sun!.\n\nyour aeroplane:- Hurricane\n\nSkin:-01-Malta HurricaneIIb.bmp\n
