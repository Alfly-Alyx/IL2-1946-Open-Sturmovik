Description Date: 24. July 1941 - time: 05.00\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nLate yesterday evening the remains of convoy 'Substance' made it safely into port after almost constant air attack.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nYou are not long returned to Ta Kali airfield and it is very early in the morning, you are bleary eyed as you and your flight are called before the C/O:-\n\n'Now this is one that Inter-Ops intelligence didn't pick up. Several hours ago in the small hours of this morning, two Italian manned torpedoes where caught trying to get through our torpedo nets.\n\nNow the Navy has identified multiple MAS torpedo launches heading directly for the harbour entrance at 30 knots plus...The Italians have tried this before elsewhere, those boats are very likely filled with explosives.\n\nTo further complicate the situation we have just picked up an early morning bomber raid.\n\nThe Italians really want to ensure that we do not gain any benefit from 'Substance'.\n\nThe Hurricane has not been officially endorsed or tested to carry bombs but we have  had the flight crews jury rig  bomb rack's to your flight of aircraft anyhow, needs must and all that.\n\nThere is nothing to it....just don't get too low when you release the bombs.\n\nAll you have to do is bomb and strafe those MAS boats before they get to the harbour....and if you have time after that, Climb high over Grand Harbour and assist the Hurricanes scrambling from Luqa to shoot down the bomber raid that radar has picked up coming from the direction of Sicily.\n\nKeep your eyes peeled because our own MTB flotilla has left the harbour to attack the MAS boats and one small craft looks very much the same as another.\n\nGood Luck Chaps, Well... What are you waiting for? Not a cup of tea and a cooked breakfast I hope, You may wait many months. Get to your planes you have loitered on my airfield for quite long enough...\nOh yes, you will be landing at Luqa airfield. We have been transfered.'\n\nyour aeroplane:- Hurrricane\n\nOrdinance:- 2 X 250 lb bombs\n\nSkin:-02-Malta-HurriIIb dirty.bmp\n\n\n(semi-historical)\n
