Description Date: 23. July 1942 - time: 18.00\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nA major supply convoy has not reached Malta since January and the situation is now critical.\n\nAfter three weeks of hard fighting at El Alamein the Africa Korp have finally been stalemated and have halted their Offensive.\n\nOn the radio Churchill refers to the battle of El Alamein as the 'turning point'.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nVice Air Marshall Keith Park recently arrived on the island and has taken command of the air defences.\nKeith has a theory that he calls his 'Forward Air interception Plan'.\n\nThe gist of this is that we set up standing patrols off the coast and then scramble reinforcements when an engagement happens so that we can shoot down the enemy bombers before they actually get to Malta.\n\nGood in theory but we do not have the fuel to implement standing patrols so for the moment our instructions are to fly straight  out to sea and then climb for altitude once we get into position.\n\nFighters are operating on 1/2 of a tank so watch your fuel gauge.\n\n++++The telephone Rings++++\n\nSCRAMBLE !\n\nRadar has detected a large formations of planes approaching  at High altitude from the direction of the Sicilian coast.\n\n80km's and closing fast, ETA about 15 minutes on a bearing for Grand Harbour.\n\nSpitfires are scrambling.\n\nGet to you Spitfire, Climb as high as possible and intercept.\n\nyour aeroplane:- Spitfire\n\nSkin:-01-Malta SpitVc.bmp \n
