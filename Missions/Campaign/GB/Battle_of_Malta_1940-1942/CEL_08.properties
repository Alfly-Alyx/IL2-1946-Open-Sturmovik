Short \n  RAF Huricanes try and shoot down AR 196's\n
Description Date: 17. April 1940 - time: 17.30\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nThis morning's dogfight was downright terrifying, the bf109's are faster, better armed and turn almost as well as the Hurricane. The only chance we have is altitude and this morning we didn't have the 1000 foot advantage required and it cost some good pilots lives.\n\nYou read the flight diary of pilot officer Herbert Mitchell , he didn't make it back:-\n\n'The tempo of life here is just indescribable.  The morale is magnificent-pilots, ground crews and army -but it is certainly tough. The bombing is continuous on and off all day. One lives here only to destroy the Hun and hold him at bay; everything else, living conditions, sleep, food, and all the ordinary standards of living have gone by the board. It all makes the Battle of Britain and fighter sweeps seem like child's play in comparison.'\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nExhausted from this mornings flight you decide to try and catch up on some sleep, you doze off sitting upright in the ops room with Mitchell's Log still open...there is a tap on your shoulder....\n\n\n++++The C/O calls you into his office++++\n\n'A Sunderland flying boat has been shadowing a couple of Italian CantZ-506B float planes looking for flight crews that presumably had to ditch in the drink.\nCan you and your wingman get aloft and fly to the coordinates given and shoot the blighters down ?'.\n\nA request from the C/O is akin to an order.\n\nDon't forget your MaeWest life jacket.\n\nyour aeroplane: - Hurricane\n\nSkin:-01-Malta HurricaneIIb.bmp\n
