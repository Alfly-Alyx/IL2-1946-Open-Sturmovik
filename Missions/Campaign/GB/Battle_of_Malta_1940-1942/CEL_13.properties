Short \nProtect Hal Far Radio Station\n
Description Date: 02. July 1942 - time: 06.30\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nTobruk surrendered on June 21st.\n\nRommel has pushed the Eighth Army all the way back into Egypt to a place called El Alamein where the Allies are preparing to make a stand. If they fail Egypt will fall and with it access to the Suez Canal and control of the Middle Eastern Oilfields.\n\nLast month the night after the Beauforts attacked the Cruiser squadron,  a Wellington managed to locate and  torpedo the battleship 'Littorio'.\n\nIn Russia the German army has advanced thousands of miles in the last year.... maybe it is too late and Germany has too much of an advantage.... maybe we are already beaten but we just don't realise it yet.\n\nEvery day you put thoughts such as these out of your mind and climb back into your fighter plane, getting into that plane, making Jerry's life difficult in the air and then getting back down again is your entire life. At least you can do something which is more than can be said for the thousands of starving wretches that can only watch your aerial fights.... and then shelter from the inevitable bombs in dank caves.\n\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\n\nDue to our lamentable supply situation Interceptors are operating on 1/2 a tank so watch your fuel gauge.\n\nIt has been a quiet week with relatively few daylight raids...\n\n++++The telephone Rings++++\n\nSCRAMBLE !\n\nRadar has an intermittent contact believed to be a small group of aircraft flying fast and low down Malta's Sicily facing coast...either that or its an electronics malfunction.\n\nJerry could be up to his tricks again...remember always watch for the Hun in the sun.\n\n60km's and closing fast, ETA about 10 minutes on a bearing for Hal far Radar Station.\n\nSpitfires are scrambling.\n\nGet to you Spitfire, take off as quickly as possible and try not to get bounced (again)\n\nyour aeroplane:- Spitfire\n\nSkin:-02-Malta SpitVc greenblue.bmp \n
