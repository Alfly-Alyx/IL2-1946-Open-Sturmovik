Name  The Battle of Malta 1940-1942
Description A 51 mission single player campaign.\n\nIn 1940 the Axis powers vowed to bomb Malta into submission.\n\nWhat followed was possibly the toughest RAF aerial campaign of the war.\n\nThese missions and the briefing style adopted are intended to immerse players in the mood of this period.\n\nSome missions are typical examples of the thousands of missions that were flown, some are accurate representations of actual missions.\n\nPlayers will fly the Gladiator, Hurricanes, Beaufighter, SpitfireVc and briefly the A20 and Martlet.\n\n\nIt is recommended that you pick a  high starting rank.\n\nAlso play with No instant Success turned OFF as survival is the mission goal, let your conscience judge success or failure beyond this.\n\n\nThis is primarily a fighter campaign and most missions represent 'Radar guided intercepts' and will throw you into action fairly quickly, the mission track represents the radio guidance that pilots receive whilst aloft which is why they are often not uniform.\n\n+++++++++++++++\n\designed for 403m+\n\n+++++++++++++++\n\nfor campaign representation see the enclosed Read Me (GB) and Historical background files.\n
