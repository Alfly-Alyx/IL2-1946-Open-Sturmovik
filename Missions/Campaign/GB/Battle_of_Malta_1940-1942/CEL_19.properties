Description Date: 28. July 1941 - time: 17.00\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nLuqa airfield is more developed than Ta Kali but for the aircrews and everyone else in Le Valletta there is a price.\n\nYou join the islanders in a large cavern on the side of Grand harbour at nighttimes to shelter from the bombing. Sleep is virtually impossible with the noise of the anti-aircraft guns and the bombs. But you are safe with 50 feet of rock over your heads.\n\nOne night you survived a direct hit, the biggest danger being damage to eardrums from concussion.\n\nIt is cold and damp and you simply cannot imagine how the islanders have endured these conditions for the last 12 months.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nThe C/O is in fine spirits, his handlebar mustachio positively glimmers.\n\n'Hello Chaps, I have some very good news for you this afternoon.\nIts a bit defeatist to wait around here all the time whilst Johnny I-tie and Jerry rain bombs down on our heads so we are going to hit the ball back over the net, so to speak, and attack some Italian airfields in Sicily and at Pantellery.\n\nFlights of Beaufighters escorted by Hurricanes are to attack selected airfields this evening.\nYou are going to come in low and fast so we should catch them on the hop.\n\nThe Beaufighters will bomb and strafe whilst the Hurricanes provide cover. Hurricanes feel free to drop down and strafe the airfield if there is no trade in the air.\n\nDo not spend more than a few minutes over the field and then head home at fast cruise speed.\n\nCheck your life rafts, I would, your Hurri's have been through a lot, or should I say a lot has been through your Hurri's and I doubt the ground crew have time to check such things.\n\nOur Meteorologist forecasts good weather but with fairly low cloud.\n\nWatch your fuel gauges as this is right on the edge of a Hurricanes operational range.If you have to land at Ta kali.\n\n(timeskip recommended)\n\nyour aeroplane:- Hurricane\n\nSkin:-02-Malta-HurriIIb dirty.bmp\n\n(Semi-Historical)\n
