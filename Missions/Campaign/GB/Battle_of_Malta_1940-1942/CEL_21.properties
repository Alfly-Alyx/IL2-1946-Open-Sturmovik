Short \nThe final Duel\n
Description Date: 11. November 1942 - time: 07.20\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nAfter 'The second Battle of El Alamein' the Africa Korps is in full retreat.\nWe retook Tobruk three days ago.\n\nOn the same day nearly 300,000 American and Commonwealth troops landed in Morocco, Algeria and Algiers.\n\nGeneral Rommel has been 'Outfoxed' and is now trapped between two fronts.\n\nTwo fast Cruiser Minelayers, the 'Manxman' and the 'Welshman' arrived today packed with supplies.\n\nAnother large convoy codenamed 'Stone age' is on its way from Alexandria, if this one gets through we have effectively broken the siege.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nSpirits are running high in the old town, it is only to be expected after such protracted struggle and suffering, it is a little like a cork popping from a bottle, you feel elated to have lived through the events of the past two years, a feeling almost  of ecstatic joy...\n\n...until the C/O calls you into his office.\n\nHis mustachio positively shimmers AND there is a glint in his eye so this must be trouble.\n\n'Hello old Chap, have to say I had my doubts about you navy types at first but you have proved you are made of the right stuff.\n\nNow we have a bit of a problem that I think you may be able to help us with.\n\nThat Canadian George 'Screwball' Beurlington was a damnably good pilot, managed to shoot down 33 planes in under ten weeks, but without discipline we had no choice but to post him elsewhere, just couldn't control the fellow... which as it turns out is bloody inconvenient as he would be just the man for the job right now.... but of course you can do it, let me explain.\n\nEvery morning for the last two weeks a lone Bf109 has loitered just off the coast shooting down transports and bombers with relative ease. Whenever we send up a fighter flight to get him he uses his superior speed and avoids the engagement,\nHe will however engage lone fighters when he is sure that he is not about to get jumped.... we have lost several of our best pilots already attempting to shoot whoever he is down.... I thought you might perhaps like to have a pop at this blighter before he gets even cockier ?.\n\nOf course you would, that's settled then.\n\nYou take off immediately, here is your flight plan.\n\nOh and Good Luck Old Chap.\n\nMy staff driver will drop you off at your plane.
