Description Date: 05. September 1940 - time: 07.45\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nFrequent raids with heavy fighter escort.\n\nOur newspapers like to characterize the Regia Aeronautica as a bunch of brash show off's that love nothing better than to perform acrobatics when numerically superior but lack moral fibre on equal terms.\n\nThe truth is not as simple, many Italian pilots are highly skilled and undoubtedly the equal of ourselves in terms of flying ability and personal courage, in the air  'Johnny I-tie' is worthy of  extreme respect.\n\nIn war the truth is one thing but what is good for morale is often another.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nFlying Officer Collins is a marvel, he and his crew have somehow managed to patch up and make airworthy three flights of Hurricanes and three Gladiators.\n\nDuring quieter periods the less experienced pilots are put through a very harsh training regime. Malta is not the ideal posting for a green pilot...or for any pilot that wants a reasonable chance of survival.\n\nAt least the fighter boys in Britain are beginning to turn things around. On the radio it sounds like a hell of a show and Winston Churchill somehow always manages to perfectly phrase the mood of the moment.\n\n\nStanding orders are that any pilot rashly endangering his own life or those of his colleagues will be reprimanded, do not attack enemy formations if heavily escorted by fighters or unless you have an exit strategy. We are totally outnumbered in the sky and to survive you need to select your targets carefully and then disengage rapidly.\n\n\n++++The telephone Rings++++\n\nSCRAMBLE !\n\nRadar has detected a large formation of high flying planes approaching from Sicily.\n\n90km's and closing fast, ETA about 15 minutes on a bearing for Grand Harbour\n\nHurricanes are scrambling from Ta kali and Luqa, this is an interception almost in squadron strength.\n\nGet to you Hurricane, climb as high as possible and intercept.\n\nyour aeroplane:- Hurricane\n\nSkin:-03-Malta HurricaneIa ma.bmp\n\n(Semi Historical)\n
