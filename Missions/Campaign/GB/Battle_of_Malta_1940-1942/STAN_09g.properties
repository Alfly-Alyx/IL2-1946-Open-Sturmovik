Short \nSpitfires intercept Heinkels\n
Description Date: 26. October 1942 - time: 14.45\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nIntelligence estimates that the bombers from Malta are currently sinking about a third of all Axis supplies to North Africa.\n\nThe 'Forward Defence plan' coupled with the number of planes we can put in the air has effectively stopped the day raids and the Axis have suffered terrible losses.\n\nSo far this month fighters on this Island have scored over 300 probable or confirmed kills.\n\nIn North Africa commonwealth forces have launched another offensive at El Alamein under the direction of General Montgomery and the Africa Korp is falling back in retreat.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nIt really seems like 'the tide has turned', but we owe this turn of events to over 170 allied pilots who will not see it.\n\nIt is still dangerous in the air and you must not 'count your chickens' as we still face some damned good pilots, watch your six and stay high and fast.\n\nToday it is your turn to fly a standing patrol. Climb to 20,000 feet (6000metres) and take up a patrol pattern until your fuel reaches about a quarter of a tank (25%).\n\nRadar will warn you of any contacts and we will scramble reinforcements if necessary.\n\nyour aeroplane:- Spitfire\n\nSkin:-03-Malta SpitVc darkblue.bmp \n
