Short \nRAF bombing mission against a German Submarine\n
Description Date: 25. December 1941 - time: 07.00\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nBombing continues remorselessly.\n\nGerman U-boat activity has increased dramatically, last month they torpedoed and sank the carrier 'HMS Ark Royal'.\n\nIn North Africa the allies launched 'Operation Crusader' and have relieved Tobruk forcing the Africa Korp back to Gazala.\nA pyrrhic victory because tank losses were extremely heavy, Rommel really taught our boys a lesson in armoured warfare. German propaganda is calling him 'The Dessert Fox'.\n\nForce 'K' has been reinforced by the cruisers 'Ajax' and 'Neptune' and two more destroyers. Two days ago they got into a running battle with the Italian fleet in the Gulf of Sirte and unfortunately ran into a minefield, 'Neptune' sunk and 'Aurora' was badly damaged enough to be put out of commission.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nIt is almost Christmas again, your second on the island, and full of festive cheer, the C/O calls you to his office:-\n\n'The recent outbreak of dysentery in Malta has disabled a large number of our pilots. We need somebody with the ability to fly a Beaufighter...I thought of you because I always maintain that if you can fly a Gloster Gladiator you can fly anything!.\n\nSearch planes have spotted a German U-boat running above the surface within attack range, his batteries must be flat as he did not dive.\n\nAll the details are in your flight plan.\n\nYou will pick up an escort of Hurricanes at the North of the Island.\n\nA Sunderland will guide you to the U-boat about 250km's away.\n\nThe Meteorologist forecasts a clear day.\n\nThis is a chance to get back at Jerry for his sub-aqua antics, glass of Sherry anyone?'.\n\nyour aeroplane:- Bristol Beaufighter\n\nOrdinance:-2X500lb \n(representing depth charges, try a long fuse)\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta Beaufighter.BMP\n
