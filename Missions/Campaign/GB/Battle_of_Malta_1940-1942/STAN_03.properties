Short \n  RAF bombing mission against Italian merchant ships\n
Description Date: 12. December 1940 - time: 11.20\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nThe aerial bombardment has continued unabated but moral on the Island is high. Admiral Cunningham's carrier aircraft damaged half the Italian fleet in Taranto harbour.\n\nNorth Africa, General O'Conner has switched to the offensive and taken Sidi Barani capturing 30,000 Italian prisoners, 270 Tanks and 120 pieces of Artillery. Now the Italians are making a special effort to reinforce the remains of their stricken army.\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nYou have been given a few days well-deserved leave and have decided to spend it in the old town. Grand Harbour is something else. To say it is steeped in history is an understatement; with the sun glinting off the water you decide to take a trip across the bay in a dysagh, a kind of Maltese gondola. On the other side an RAF staff car is awaiting you. The C/O of Luqa airbase needs to see you urgently, all leave is cancelled.\n\nSearch planes have spotted an Italian Convoy en-route from Pantellery to North Africa, it is imperative that it is stopped.\n\nThe C/O has had to rustle up a flight of Hurricane jockeys at short notice and heard that you were in the area .\n\nA  Sunderland will guide the Blenheims to the convoy about 200km's away and you will provide escort.\n\nThis mission is very close to your operational range so keep a very close eye on your fuel gauge, if for any reason you have to ditch in the sea we will do our best to get a flying boat to you.\n\nThe Meteorologist forecasts a clear day but with the likelihood of low cloud\n\n'Chins up Chaps, stiff upper lip and all that, when you get back old Dobbie has organised a reception at the consulate for you all and some naval types so if you get time to practice your Highland dancing......'\n\n(you have to seriously wonder about your CO sometimes !)\n\nyour aeroplane:- Hurricane\n\nSkin:- 03-Malta Hurricane1a ma.BMP\n
