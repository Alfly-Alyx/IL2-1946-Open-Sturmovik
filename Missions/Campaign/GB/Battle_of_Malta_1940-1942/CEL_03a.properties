Short \nDefence of Convoy 'Pedestal' against the Regio Aeranautica\n
Description Date: 12. August 1942 - time: 16.00\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nGibraltar seems like a world away from Malta and it is good to be off the submarine.\n\nYou have even eaten proper meals in the local restaurants.\n\nAs one of the 'Gladiator Aces' of Malta and possibly one of the most experienced pilots in the RFAA, you are to serve aboard the carrier 'HMS Indomitable'  for the next two weeks. After a weeks wrest you are summoned to a briefing:-\n\nThe C/O clears his throat and speaks:-\n\n'Gentlemen, Malta is in terrible trouble, food, ammunition and fuel have run out. The Maltese have taken the kind of beating that make's the Blitz look like a Sunday school picnic.\n\nWe have assembled the fastest merchant ships in the world for this convoy, Winston Churchill even had to beg Roosevelt to lend us the Oilier 'Ohio'. I hope you are beginning to understand the gravity of this situation.\n\nThis operation is so important that the Royal Navy escorts from Gibraltar plus three carriers, the 'Eagle', the 'Victorious' and the 'Indomitable', are going to remain with the Merchant ships until the straits, despite the Axis airfields in Sardinia and Sicily ,you and the pilots of the FAA are vital to the convoy as you are providing the aircover.\n\nSome of you are flying SeaHurricanes and some of you are flying the new lend lease 'Martlets ',  an American crate I know, but reputed to have excellant flying characteristics,we got them before the US navy for this operation !.'\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nThe Convoy left Gibraltar a day ago, on the first day out disaster struck when a submarine torpedoed and sunk the carrier 'HMS Eagle', this morning the escorts fought a running battle with some Italian MAS boats. We are now coming into range of the Italian airfields in Sardinia.\n\nScramble !\n\nGet to your Martlet.\n\nOur radar has detected a large force of unidentified planes to the North 2-10,000 feet (1-3000 metres), ETA in about ten minutes.\n\nThe 'HMS Indomitable' is going to increase speed for about five minutes so get off the flight deck quickly.\n\nA flight  of SeaHurricanes from HMS Victorious is already flying cover and we are vectoring them North.\n\nyour aeroplane:-Martlet (F4F-4)\n\nSkin:-01-Malta-Martlet.bmp\n\n(semi-historical)\n\nAs you are probably unused to the F4F-4 or certainly rusty if you have played through this campaign, here are a few reminders-\n\ni)  You need to let your chocks go before takeoff. \nii) The Gear on this plane has to be manualy raised and lowered so make sure you have assigned key functions for this task.\niii) Remember to lower your landing hook when you attempt to land back on a carrier.\n\n
