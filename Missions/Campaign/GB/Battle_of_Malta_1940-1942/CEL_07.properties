Description Date: 22. March 1941 - time: 17.45\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nThe Situation\n\nThe last two months have cost the RAF many planes and pilots. Out of 340 Hurricanes that have been delivered to the Island, 28 are still currently flyable.\n\nWe now know that we are facing the German X Fliegercorp.\n\nThe Italians continue to bomb us by night and the Germans bomb us during the day.\n\nThe North African situation has gone from good to very bad.\nGeneral O'Connor took Tobruk and drove the Italians back into Cyrenaica before defeating them at the Battle of Beda Fomme. In total there were more than 200,000 prisoners.\nThen German troops began appearing in North Africa led by a General called Irwin Rommel. Last month the 'Africa Korp' attacked and drove us all the way back into Egypt. Tobruk is still holding on by its eyelids.\n\nOur situation is deteriorating with fuel, ammunition and food in limited supply.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nYou are tired, hungry and frustrated by the whole situation but you know that there is nothing that can be done, the end of another uneventful watch.\n\n+++++The telephone rings++++++\n\nCoast-watchers report that two low flying German fighter bombers have just cleared the coastline heading for Ta Kali airfield.\n\nSCRAMBLE !\nAfter the routine daytime patrols, your plane is the only one currently fuelled up, it has about a quarter of a tank.\n\nGet to you Hurricane and get off the ground as quickly as possible and show Jerry that we still have some teeth !.\n\nyour aeroplane:- Hurricane\n\nSkin:-02-Malta HurriIa Maltablue.bmp\n
