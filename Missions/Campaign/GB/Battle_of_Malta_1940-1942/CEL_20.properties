Description Date: 12. November 1941 - time: 07.15\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nThere has been heavy enemy air activity since force 'K's successful convoy attack.\n\nRussia is a long way away but apparently the onset of very cold weather has bogged down the German army and stalled their offensive, people in the mess keep mentioning 'Napoleon'. How Napoleon relates to a modern war is certainly a subject of contention.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nThis looks worrying, the C/O has again got that glint in his eye:-\n\n'Hello Chaps, I know its early but Johnny I-tie will probably not be out of bed either so it is an ideal morning to attack Comiso airfield in Sicily.\n\nThis time we are attacking in strength with two squadrons of Hurricanes. The IIb's will carry bombs whilst the IIc's fly cover.\n\nYou are going to come in low and fast so we should catch them on the hop, Hurricane IIc Jockeys please feel free to drop down and strafe the airfield or nearby seaplane base if there is no trade in the air. Those Oerlikons are extremely powerful affairs.\n\nDo not spend more than a few minutes over the field and then head home as fast as you are able.\n\nOur Meteorologist forecasts a misty morning which is all the better to catch Johnny I-tie with his trousers down !.\n\nWatch your fuel gauges as this is right on the edge of a Hurricanes operational range. You only have fuel for one pass over the target.\n\nyour aeroplane:- Hurricane\n\n(timeskip recommended)\n\nSkin:-01-Malta-HurricaneIIc.bmp or 01-Malta-HurriIIb dirty.bmp depending upon rank.\n\n(Semi-Historical)\n
