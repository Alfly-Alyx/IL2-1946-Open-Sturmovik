Short \n Gladiator Orientation Flight\n
Description Date: 20. May 1940 - time: 10.00\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\n\nIn Malta all is quiet at Ta Kali Airfield.\n\nEveryone is trying to keep busy although in reality all that can be done has been done considering the pitiful resources available. The whisper around the base is that Italy is going to enter the war any day now and then all hell is going to break loose.\n\nIt concerns you, it concerns you a lot, the QMG discovered some crates with seven Gloster Gladiator's inside, flying Officer Collins put them together and you volunteered to transfer from your seaplane to fly with the newly formed fighter flight, of the seven volunteer pilots only John Waters has any fighter training, he did a one week course with 802 squadron aboard HMS Glorious.\n\nLooking at the antiquated biplane sitting on the runway you wonder if you have made the most terrible mistake !.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\ncombat orders:-\n\n'Hello Chaps, Squadron Leader Alan 'Jock' Martin here, with war clouds looming on the Italian horizon, we need to hone our fighting skills and get some hours flying 'the old girl'.\n\nI want you to take off and fly NorthWest over Kalafrana seaplane base, then follow the coast to Le Valletta and Grand Harbour, visibility is very good so you should get a good look at Fort St Elmo, Fort Riccossoli, Manoel Island and Luqa airbase as you fly over the harbour, then hop across the Island to Hal Far radar station where the boys have put out a target for you to check your guns.\n\nThe secret is to get close but not too close.\n\nAmuse yourself for as long as it entertains and then  fly back to Ta Kali.\n\nIt is a lovely day, I would fly quite low if I were you, you'll get a better look at the Island.'\n\nyour aeroplane:- Gladiator MkII\n\nSkin:-01-Malta-RNGladiator.bmp\n
