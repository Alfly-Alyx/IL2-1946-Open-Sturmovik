Short \nBeauforts attack on 'Trento'\n
Description Date: 15. June 1942 - time: 04.15\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nConvoy 'Vigorous' sailed from Alexandria at the same time that 'Harpoon' left Gibraltar. Threatened by the Italian fleet, constant air attack and German E boats, five out of eleven merchant ships and two destroyers were sunk before Admiral Vian gave the order to turn back, whereupon the Cruiser 'Hermione' was torpedoed and sunk by a U-boat and another destroyer had to be scuttled.\n\nAn unmitigated disaster is perhaps the best way to describe events.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:-\n\nThe C/O needs to see you urgently and in the small hours of the morning you are awoken from your cave. Air vice Marshall Sir Hugh Pugh Lloyd looks as bright as a button:- \n\n'You probably realise that we now have plenty of fighter pilots, they maybe a little hungry on Malta rations but they remain fighter pilots nonetheless, what I am currently short of are pilots flexible enough to fly heavier planes...\nYou mastered the Beaufighter so I feel certain you will have no problems piloting a Beaufort torpedo bomber, as I always maintain...\n\n....if you can fly a Gladiator you can fly anything !\n\nSearch planes have spotted two Italian battleships and their associated cruiser and destroyer  escorts steaming to intercept the remains of convoy 'Vigorous'.\n\n217 Squadron was due to transfer to Ceylon but have been redirected to Malta for this operation. Unfortunately one of their pilots was injured during a raid yesterday and that is why we have to ask you.\n\nTake off may be a bit tricky in this light as we do not dare turn on the runway lights (even if they still worked)....it will be light by the time you return so landing should be straight forward enough.\n\nFollow your flightplan to the 'Littorio' and her cruiser escort about 200 miles away.\n\nWhen the war is over and the name Malta is mentioned, you can turn to your friends and relatives and say proudly, \u201CI was there!\u201D Now, boys, I want you to go out and pop \u2018em in the bag from me!'\n\nyour aeroplane:-A20G Havoc (representing a  Beaufort)\n\nOrdinance:- 1 torpedo\n\nSkin:- 01-Malta RAF dessert.bmp\n\n(Historical- but for the unavoidable substituion of an A20 for a Beaufort)\n
