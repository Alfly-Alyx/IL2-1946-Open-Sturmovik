Short \nDefence of Convoy 'Pedestal' against the Lufwaffe and RA\n
Description Date: 13. August 1942 - time: 11.00\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation:-\n\nYesterday four merchant ships were sunk whilst the carrier 'HMS Victorious'  and a cruiser were badly damaged enough to have to turn back. We have lost the use of over two thirds of our fighter capacity and used up most of our anti-aircraft ammunition. \nTen merchant ships still remain afloat, the fight is still on to get them to Malta.\n\nDuring the night we passed through Sardinian airspace so this morning we are in range of the airfields of Sicily.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\n'HMS Indomitable' remains the last operational carrier and the remaining servicable fighters, mainly Sea Hurricanes, have been gradualy transfered to her as the other carriers have been sunk or damaged.\nIt is now possible for some of the Malta fighters to provide cover but these Spitfires  will be operating at extreme range.\n\nScramble !\n\nGet to your Sea Hurricanes, our radar has detected a large force of unidentified planes to the South approaching between 2-10,000 feet (600-3000 metres), ETA in about ten minutes.\n\nWe are going to increase speed for about five minutes so get off the flight deck quickly.\n\nB flight is already aloft and vectoring South East.\n\nGood luck Chaps, give Jerry a bloody nose from all of us.\n\nIf the 'Indomitable' should get hit,  and it seems that there is a high possibility that she will, try and use your remaining fuel to get to Malta.\n\nyour aeroplane:-Hurricane\n\nSkin:-01-Malta-SeaHurricane1a.bmp\n\n(Semi-Historical)\n\nUnfortunately the Hurricane does not have a hook implemented so landing back on the carrier is almost impossible.  You should instead attempt to land  in Malta.\n
