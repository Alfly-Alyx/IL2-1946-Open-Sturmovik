Description Date: 24. August 1940 - time: 15.30\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nThe Situation\n\nWith civilian casualties mounting, General Dobbie made the decision that the population must go underground.\n\nThe Islands soft limestone is ideally suited for hand digging. The railway yards manufactured thousands of picks and shovels and the Maltese set to work digging an underground complex over thirteen miles long containing dormitories, a canteen, a hospital, rail tracks and magazines.\n\nWhen you finally get some leave and can get off Ta Kali airbase you might get a chance to have a look.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\nCombat orders:\n\nOperations have taken their toll on crew and machines. New Hurricanes get flown into the island but the support and spare parts for them are lacking so aircraft rarely operate at maximum efficiency. We have no choice but to do our best with what we have.\n\nReplacement pilots are a problem of another order, almost half have never flown a combat operation before.\n\n\n++++The telephone Rings++++\n\nSCRAMBLE !\n\nThe first daylight raid in four days and the cloud is thick enough to walk on.\n\nRadar has detected a large formation of high flying planes approaching from Sicily.\n\n90km's and closing fast, ETA about 15 minutes on a bearing for Ta Kali airfield.\n\nHurricanes are scrambling\n\nGet to you Hurricane, climb as high as possible and intercept what are probably more Savoia79 bombers.\n\nKeep your 'eyes peeled' and if  heavily outnumbered  by the usual Fiat Cr42 escort, dive away and live to fight another day.\n\nyour aeroplane:- Hurricane\n\nSkin:-01-Malta HurricaneIb.bmp\n\n(Historical)\n
