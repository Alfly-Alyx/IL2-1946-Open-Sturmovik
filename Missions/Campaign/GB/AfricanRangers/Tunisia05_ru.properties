Description 47 Squadron\n=-------------------=\n12 June 1943\n=-------------------=\nTime: 0355\n=-------------------=\nWeather: Good\n=-------------------=\nOrdnance: 1 x Torpedo\n=-------------------=\n\nRight chaps, now that the garrisons at Lampedusa and Linosa have followed Pantelleria into capitulation, we can start on our next task, which is preliminary operations in support of the proposed landings in Sicily - codenamed Husky.\n\nOur task is to help prepare the way for the invasion fleet to gather in safety.  To this end we must firstly isolate the island from supply and reinforcement.  Already we've received information of a convoy heading from Naples to Syracuse.  We've plotted out an estimated interception path - it's up to you to do the rest.  Expect to see friendly aircraft in the area - they'll be like bees round a honey pot if the enemy ships turn up.\n
