We're getting Naval reports of enemy PT boats shadowing the invasion fleet as dusk starts to settle.  We're going to be mounting round-the-clock patrols to keep these pests at bay, and you'll be taking the next turn.  Just follow the prescribed pattern over the fleet, and keep your eyes on the horizon.\n
