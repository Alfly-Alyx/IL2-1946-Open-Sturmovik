Rockets\n=-------------------=\n\nTarget this morning is the airfield at Comiso.  I'm sure I don't need to emphasise to you chaps the importance of knocking out the enemy's air capability prior to the landings.\n\nYou'll take the first leg to Malta, where you'll pick up your escort, then head straight to the target with them in tow.  Hopefully the lazy buggers will have had their breakfast long before you arrive.\n\nMake a mess of the field, then make a beeline for home.\n
