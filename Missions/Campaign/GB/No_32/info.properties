Name With No.32 Sqn In France
Description A semi-fictional, NO ICONS campaign for the RAF simulation enthusiast which will take him through the Battle of France, May 1940.\n\nIMPORTANT! Included are new RAF pilot voices by myself.  They do include some rather rich language so best not to play through speakers when children are about.  Make sure you back up the original RAF and French sound files before installing the new ones!  It has been my intention to add some RAF atmosphere with these new voices - they may get repetitive in places but so do the old ones.\n\nIMPORTANT! Make sure you give yourself the starting rank of FLIGHT SERGEANT.\n\nIMPORTANT! This campaign has been specifically designed for a NO ICONS environment - it will be rather pointless in places if you use them.  When playing this campaign I also remove subtitles and all other modern intrusions.  Much more immersive don't you think? In designing this campaign I have focused on the journey as much as the destination.  Tight formation flying is important (you should fly as close as your AI squadron mates do) and enjoy the look of the thing.  There'll be plenty going on.\n\nDifficulty should be full with the exception of 'NO INSTANT SUCCESS' and 'NO EXTERIOR VIEW' (for take off purposes).  In addition I give myself the luxury of the speedbar, but that's entirely up to you old chap.\n\nPlease make sure to read the Readme file for further gen.\n\nPlease use 'Compans No32_GZB' skin for the entire campaign. \n\nGood luck and Per Ardua Ad Astra!
