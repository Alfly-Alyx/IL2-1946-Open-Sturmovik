Description May 12th 1940.\n\n7.30am.\n\nUp early this morning and paying the price for last night's celebrations.  I think The Skipper was pleased with my performance and the chaps all gathered around for the story.  I tried to keep nonchalant about the whole thing like they seem to do but getting the best of two 109s was quite a thrill, especially after our morning's luck with the Ju 88!\nThe weather's absolutely filthy again but I'm certainly getting the hang of keeping my No.1 in sight.  Just him and myself going up again today.\n\nThe Hun continue to push westwards from Belgium and we're starting to see hundreds of refugees straggling along the roads along with the BEF and French army.  Poor devils - it does all look rather bleak.  No.1 Sqn reported huge formations of German bombers in their sector.  B Flight encountered some isolated raiders over the airfield but couldn't catch the bastards.  I hope we find some today.\n\n
