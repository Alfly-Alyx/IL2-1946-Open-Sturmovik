Name Day 2
Short \n
Description May 11th 1940.\n\n\nSo....baptism of fire received.  It certainly was thrilling.  I think I conducted myself rather well, though The Skipper's an absolute hothead.  It pissed down all this morning and very tense flying through all that with 12 yards distance between oneself and the next kite but that's the form and I'm trying my best.  \nI came home rather flushed expecting a celebratory meal and a bottle of plonk but no such luck.  The Skipper can't abide bigheads in his mob and we're a team so a good morning's outing for Red Section.  \nWeather's cleared somewhat and I'm up again as No.2  this afternoon.  Bit of a case of the brown ring twitch at the moment but it all seems to disappear once one is in action.\n'Sproggy' seems to be my new nickname around here.  Not quite sure how it's meant but as the new chap there's bugger all I can say about it at present.\n\n
