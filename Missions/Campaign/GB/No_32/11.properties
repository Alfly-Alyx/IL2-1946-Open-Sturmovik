Description May 18th 1940.\n\nEarly afternoon.\n\nReturned from our mission 2 days ago and was debriefed by the I/O.  He looked at me in rather a strange way:\n\n"Are you sure you're alright?" he asked.  Of course I said I was right as rain but he told me to get some kip and I wasn't arguing.  I awoke at 11.00am today.  I must have slept for 24 hours at least.  Actually we've only had penny-packets up as petrol is scarce as hell.\nNews is Dowding's refusing to send any more of our fighters to France.  Not popular with the local military or our chaps on the ground.  I must say I feel rather ashamed.  The French are fighting for their lives over here.  We'll be next.\nWhilst I slumbered the Germans advanced from the south and have us almost encircled.  There's boats everywhere, both the steaming and burning variety.  \nStill, my beard's gone and I'm wearing fresh underpants.  What a pleasure the basics of life are!\n\nOur Blenheims are attacking German armour south of Bernay.  \n\n\n\n\n
