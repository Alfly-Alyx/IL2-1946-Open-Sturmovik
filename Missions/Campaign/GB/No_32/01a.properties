Description May 11th 1940.\n\n9.00am (Too bloody early!)\n\nArgentan, France.\n\nQuite a hike over The Channel with The Skipper and his No.2 - a South London rogue by the name of Cloves.  It was jolly hard keeping tight formation with the chaps and The Old Man's a stickler for it.  The weather's been rotten so flying's been limited but The Skipper's taking me up today for a gander at France - or what we can see of it through the muck.  The Hun have been probing our defences around here, sending over the occasional bomber or pair of fighters.  It's important to keep looking around all the time but it's tricky whilst trying to hold formation! \n\n "If you can't read my serial number you're too far off!" says the skipper.  I've got his 'GZ-E' imprinted on my retina.\n\nSo, up into unfriendly skies then. \n
