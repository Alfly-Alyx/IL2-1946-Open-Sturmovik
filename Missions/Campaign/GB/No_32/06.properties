Description May 15th 1940:\n\nAfter yesterday's attack on Le Havre and her port we're taking no chances.  We've been patrolling around the clock.  We're hungry,  tired and in dire need of a wash and change of clothes.  BEF and French army units all along the roads and there's rumours of an evacuation pretty soon.  Poor Le Havre caught it pretty badly yesterday.  Madame J's cafe was damaged in the raid but she still put on a splendid dinner for us last night.  She calls No.32 'My pilots'.  I dearly hope we can avert what now seems inevitable.\n\nMy first outing with Green Section.  Nice chaps.\n\n\n
