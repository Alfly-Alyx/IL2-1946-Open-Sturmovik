Description May 12th 1940.\n\n10.00am.\n\nWe returned from our morning patrol and were met by the I/O who had been on the phone with a French fighter squadron.  It seems they lost two of their Moranes in the same location as our little scrap with the 109s yesterday.  To make matters worse another of their sections reported seeing the affair and claimed the attacking aircraft were Hurricanes.  How ghastly to think we may have attacked our own side.  I distinctly remember seeing yellow markings on their tails but didn't notice any roundels.  I'll pay a lot more attention from now on but The Skipper tore into them and I assumed he'd made a positive identification.  I feel rather sick to my stomach about the whole thing.\n\n'A' Flight is up on patrol and I'm flying as Yellow 3.\n\n\n
