Description May 15th 1940.\n\nNight.\n\nLanded, had an hour's kip then got woken up 20 minutes ago by the now familiar whistle of bombs falling around my hut.  I'd go and sleep in one of the dugouts but I've been volunteered to go up and chase these bastards down.  As my nightflying abilities are fairly non-existant it's probably going to be frightening.  Still, it's easy to find the airfield as it's blazing like Guy Fawkes night.  Cloves has been feeding me carrots.  Supposed to help night vision.  I shall be bright orange tomorrow morning.\n
