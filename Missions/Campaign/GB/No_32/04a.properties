Description May 12th 1940.\n\nLate afternoon.\n\nThe Phoney War is well and truly over.  Reports of attacks by massed formations of Hun bombers and fighters all along the French border.  \n\nWe're all suffering from the strain of flying around the clock, though the chaps are in good spirits.  The Skipper's had us digging trenches all afternoon.  Probably wise judging by the reports elsewhere to the east.\n'B' Flight has been up this afternoon searching for lone bombers harrassing our retreating armies and refugees between Argentan and Le Havre.  We're going up to take a gander.  \n
