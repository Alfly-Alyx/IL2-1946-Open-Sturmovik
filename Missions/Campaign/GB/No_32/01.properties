Name Into France
Short Escorting a C47\n
Description May 10th 1940.\n\nWittering, South Coast of England.\n\n\nI've been posted to No.32 Sqn after passing out at Cranwell.  It's been a splended two weeks and finally a few short hours in a modern aeroplane!  The Hawker Hurricane is a joy after the rather outdated Harts we've been flying and she performs like a charm.  Somewhat slower than the sleek Spitfires we've seen but who's complaining eh?\n\nThe squadron's been flying regular sorties into Belgium and Holland supporting our troops who are putting up a fight against the Nazi juggernaught.  But the Germans seem to be rolling up the frontiers at an alarming rate.  \n\nNo.32 is now based at Argentan, south of Falaise and a half hour flight from Le Havre.  The skipper and his wingman flew in yesterday and we all mobbed them rather in the mess!  The old man's a hard-bitten sort but not unfriendly.  Five kills on his machine and he has the air of someone who's been in the thick of it.  He's picked me to fly back to France with him this afternoon.  We're to escort French brass to Le Havre and then carry on to Argentan.  The weather's bloody and I hope I don't make an ass of myself.\n\nI'm flying as Red 3.\n
