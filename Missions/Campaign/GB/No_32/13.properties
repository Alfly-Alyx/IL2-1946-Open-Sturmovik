Name 13
Short \n
Description May 20th 1940.\n\nLate morning.\n\nWe can clearly hear the rumble of the guns day and night from our billets.  I suspect every unknown soldier or airman to be a 5th columnist and we've been advised to keep a pistol on our person at all times.  Caen is being attacked relentlessly down the coast and there's very little left of our once grand airfield.  We are the front.  Soon it will be the south coast of England.  God help us.\nWe're starting to see squadrons of our Spitfires flying support from bases in England.  A welcome sight indeed.\n
