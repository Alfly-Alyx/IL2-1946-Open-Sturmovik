Description May 14th 1940.\n\nAfternoon.\n\nFor the last two days it seems as though the world has caught on fire.  We tackled a huge mixed bag of Huns south of Le Havre on the 12th, then were bombed royally on the 13th.  Reports came in of German troops 10 miles to the west and we scarpered to Le Havre leaving our unfortunate aircraftsmen to fend for themselves in several Bedford lorries.  They arrived rather shaken at midday today, full of ghastly tales of shattered civilian bodies along the road.  Absolute chaos.  I asked a badly burned French pilot if he knew where the front was:\n\n"What front?" he answered in despair.  How quickly and how completely order has broken down!\n\nAfter salvaging what aeroplanes we could, we're heading back to Argentan in squadron strength to hopefully wreak some revenge.  There's reports of at least one panzer division in the vicinity and heaven help the bastards if we catch them.\n
