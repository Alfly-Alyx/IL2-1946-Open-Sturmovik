Description May 22nd 1940.\n\nEarly afternoon.\n\nWe're off then.  Farewell to France.  It's only been 12 days since my arrival and how things have changed.  I am now an accepted member of this fine squadron and a respected flyer.  I have witnessed the Blitzkrieg first hand in all its power and horror.  \nWe leave a country devastated by the hand of modern warfare.  Madame J wept as we ate breakfast this morning but we all vowed to return.  Farewell Le Havre - I hope it's still there when we wrest this country from the clutches of Hitler and all his evil crew.\nOur last mission from these shores will be to escort one of our bomber squadrons west of Caen, avoiding the mobile flak along the coast.  From there we'll land on Jersey for some much-needed fuel and return to England later in the day.  \n\nBritain now stands alone.  The Battle of France is over.  The eyes of the free world are upon us.\n
