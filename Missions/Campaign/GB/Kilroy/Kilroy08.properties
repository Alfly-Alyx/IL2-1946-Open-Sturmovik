Short Hurricane/Online2\n
Description RED - France, may 10th, 1940.\n\nThe other guys are writing letters to their loved ones. I have no one to write.\nWasn't there some girl in Russia or some good friends in Japan, Spain and Germany?\n\nSounds silly, doesn't it? I think I'll discuss the matter with DeVille.\nI have a feeling he knows more than he'll admit.\n\nDenmark has fallen, there's fighting in Norway, and today Germany attacked Holland, Belgium and France.\n\nThree Hurricanes are ordered to patrol at 2000 ft over the front lines east of Paris, particularly the area north of the railroad.\n\nEstimated time of return : 13.20.\n\nWeather : poor, ceiling : 3000 ft.\n\nPierre Closterman and Marcel Albert are my wingmen - it couldn't be better.\n
