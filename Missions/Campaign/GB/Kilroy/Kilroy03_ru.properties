Description BLUE - Spain, september 26th, 1938.\n\nThis morning Adolf Galland and I are going southwest at 1000 m altitude in our Fiat C 42's to find the railroad between Granada and Sevilla and follow it westward in search of a republican train.\n\nOrdinance : 2 x 100 kg bombs.\n\nEstimated time over target : 10.05.\nEstimated time at home base : 10.15.\n\nWeather : good, ceiling : 1000 m.\n\nGalland is a very flamboyant man with a good sense of humour - I hate his cigars though!\n\nThank God my hangover is ... well, over.\nTonight we're having paella for dinner - one of my favorites! A bottle of rioja wouldn't hurt.\n
