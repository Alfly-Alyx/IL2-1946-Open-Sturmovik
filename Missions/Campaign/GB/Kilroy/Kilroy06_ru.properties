Description RED - Russia, november 30th, 1939.\n\nI'm in love!\n\nAfter a check-ride yesterday I met some student pilots.\nAt first sight there was something peculiar about them. It turned out they were all women.\n\nOne of them was Lydiya. Later we had a party in the mess, and afterwards ... Lydiya, oh, Lydiya.\n\nToday's orders are to attack the airfield at Helsinki with two TB-3's from 1500 m altitude. My wingman is Valantina Grizodubova.\n\nLeg    Hdg     ETO\n\n1        215      12.03.00\n2        266      12.08.00\n3        293      12.11.00\n4        039      12.14.00\n5        085      12.20.00\n6        134      12.26.00\n\nOrdinance : 14 x FAB 100.\n\nWeather : good, ceiling : 1000 m.\n\nTwo I-153's will escort us.\n\nOn the bomb-run it's a good idea to line up on the target through the bombardiers front window.\nThe bombsight must be set according to speed and altitude.\n\nDeVille will participate in the mission as tail-gunner. I'm sure he'll kill anything that threatens us from behind - he seems to have an instinct for it.\n
