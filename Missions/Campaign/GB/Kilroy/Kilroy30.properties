Description RED - Pacific Ocean, august 6th, 1945.\n\nYesterday DeVille wanted to have a word with me in private. He stared at me in a very strange way and suddenly I remembered that evening at Cranwell when we had our graduation party.\nAn odd looking man with burning eyes had approached me and started talking of all the horrible ways in which a combat pilot could end his life. In exchange for certain glory in my future carreer he wanted my soul, my memory and my loyalty.\nI had laughed and said that certain glory would buy him anything he wanted and then I had turned away from him to join the party.\nNow he told me what a big disappointment I had been and what a boring place Hell would be with me hanging around. As far as he was concerned we were even.\nTomorrow he would be going on a very interesting mission in a B-29 with a promissing guy called Tibbets.\nThen he left without further ado.\n\nMy God - I've been flying and fighting for a decade for just about anybody with the Duke of Darkness as my guardian angel.\n\nThis morning Gregory Boyington, Joe Foss, Harold Bauer and I will attack a japanese base in our F4U's.\nWe will climb northward to 2000 ft, turn northwest towards the target and finally return south to our carrier.\n\nOrdinance : 8 x 5" AP HVAR + 2 x 500 lb bombs.\n\nEstimated time of return : 08.20.\n\nWeather : good, ceiling : 5000 ft.\n
