Kilroy Campaign

In this campaign you will fly 30 different planes - fighters, fighterbombers and bombers.

You will be fighting for both red and blue forces.

All missions start on the ground and generally you'll be back on the ground within 30 minutes.

Choose country, rank and other settings to your liking.

The campaign was created on a modded platform but using only stock planes, maps, objects etc. (Mosquito B MkIV (mission 24) excluded. To fly the modded version of mission 24 edit the file Campaign.cnf and change the line Kilroy24.mis to Kilroy24M.mis or delete Campaign.cnf and rename the file CampaignU.cnf to Campaign.cnf).)

Have fun!
