Description RED - England, july 10th, 1940.\nI tried to have a talk with DeVille. He mumbled something about us having made a deal but wouldn't go into details.\nI didn't sleep very well.\n\nThis morning our channel convoys have been attacked by German bombers.\n\nFour Spitfires are ordered to patrol the London area at 10000 ft.\n\nEstimated time of return : 12.20.\n\nWeather : good, ceiling : 3000 ft.\n\nMy wingmen are Ginger Lacey, Sailor Malan and George Beuerling. Malan is the meanest killer I ever saw - he shows no mercy!\n\nThis evening we're having fish and chips for dinner - I can hardly wait!\n
