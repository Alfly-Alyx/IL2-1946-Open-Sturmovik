Name Kilroy16RuR
Short Il-2/Online1\n
Description RED - Russia, march 17th, 1942.\n\nThis morning I met a pilot named Litvyak. First she smiled the most beautyful smile but then her smile fainted and when we said goodbye she was cold as ice. Very strange - I wonder what went on.\n\nYegorova, Gorbatjov and I will head west at 500 m in our Il-2's to attack german armor at the front.\nWe must take care not to hit our own forces. They will identify themselves with black smoke.\n\nEstimated time over target : 15.06.\nEstimated time at home base : 15.13.\n\nWeather : hazy, ceiling : 1500 m.\n\nTwo Lagg-3's will escort us.\n\nOrdinance : 4 x FAB-100 + 4 x M-13.\n\nDeVille is at the rear gun. He is having a hell of a time.\n
