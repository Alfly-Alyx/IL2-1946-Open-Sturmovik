Short P11/Online1\n
Description RED - Poland, september 1st, 1939.\n\nTensions have been high at the german-polish border for months and early this morning Germany attacked Poland.\n\nOrders are to intercept German Ju-52's in our P-11's. The Ju-52's are approaching from northwest at 1000 m.\n\nEstimated time at home base : 11.15.\n\nWeather : hazy, ceiling : 1000 m.\n\nMy wingmen today are Stanislaw Skalski, Tadeusz Sawicz and Josef Frantisek. Frantisek is a czech who is now fighting for the poles.\n\nSomehow I find it easy to understand his situation. Actually it's one of the few things I understand.\n
