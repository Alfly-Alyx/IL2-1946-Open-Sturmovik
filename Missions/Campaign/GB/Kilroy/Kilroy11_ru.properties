Description BLUE - France, september 7th, 1940.\n\nOur bombers operating at day have suffered big losses to the RAF fighters so now we will attack at night.\n\nOur target tonight is ships in the harbour at Southend.\nTwo kettes of He-111's will attack from 2000 m.\n\nLeg    Hdg     ETO\n\n1        148      22.04:00\n2        270      22.07.00\n3        312      22.08.00\n4        317      22.09.00\n5        095      22.13.00\n6        352      22.15.00\n\nOrdinance : 4 x SC250 kg bombs.\n\nWeather : good, ceiling : 1000 m.\n\nOn the bomb-run I'll only have rudder control and the bombsight must be set according to altitude and speed.\n\nMy wingmen are Johannes Fink and Ludwig Rebensdorf. Fink seems to be somewhat worried about tonight's mission.\nDeVille, who is manning the top-turret gun, couldn't care less - that man has a lot of faith.\n
