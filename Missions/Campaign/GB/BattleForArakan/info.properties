Name Battle for Arakan
Description A 15-mission campaign with the RAF 135 Squadron during the First Arakan Offensive, January - May 1943, flying the Hurricane MkIIB.\n\nHistorical Background:\n\n1942 saw the British forces pushed out of Burma and to the area around Chittagong, India.  The Japanese took control of Akyab Island and the land to the north all the way to Maungdaw and Buthidaung.\n\nThis is where the front stabilized and the only serious fighting was done in the air.  Both sides had problems with logistics and neither army could manage to gather enough troops or supplies to mount any type of offensive.\n\nFinally, by mid-December 1942, the British were able to begin a limited offensive in the Arakan with the 14th Infantry Division.  The objective was to take control of the Mayu Peninsula and take Foul Point at its southern end.  Foul Point was five miles across the water from Akyab and this would allow the port to be within range of artillery fire.\n\nBy January 1943, the British had taken Maungdaw and Buthidaung and much of the Mayu Peninsula.  However, the Japanese built strong defenses at Donbaik with very durable bunkers and this put a halt to the British advance. \n\nThe RAF and JAAF were very active during this period, both offensively and defensively.  The RAF built several new airfields around Cox's Bazar enabling them to be closer to the front.  135 Squadron was one of several Hurricane squadrons in the region and they saw much action in a ground-attack role as well as air-to-air combat against their counterparts, 50th Sentai and 64th Sentai.\n\nmissions created by CzechTexan\nHurricane MkIIB skins created by Kristorf
