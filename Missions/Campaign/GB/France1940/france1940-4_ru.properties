Description May 14, 1940.\n\nWe have moved to a new airfield, just behind the frontlines, and recently captured from teh enemy. (So the base is in a bit of a mess.)\n\nThis move has been ordered because now things have REALLY started to heat up on the ground!\n\nIn a surprise move yesterday, and with extremely heavy support from the Luftwaffe, our Army Group A, spearheaded by the XIX Panzerkorps, under the command of Heinz Guderian, has moved through the Ardennes forests (which the French thought was unpenetrable) and crossed the Meuse at Sedan.\n\nThree crossings has been forced. Instead of slowly massing artillery, as the French seems to have expected, we concentrated most of our tactical bomber force to punch a hole in a narrow sector of the French lines by carpet bombing punctuated by dive bombing. The Stukas has had their best day yet!\n\nSedan is the last fortified and entrenched position along the Allied First Army Group's southern flank. Once we are through here we can advance to the English Channel, into the rear of the Allied mobile forces advancing into Belgium! They will then be trapped! \n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe know that the enemy will do their utmost to destroy the bridges we hold at Sedan. It is their best chance to stop or delay our Panzers on the ground.\n\nYour task is to stop all enemy  air attacks on the bridges. Rest assured of one thing: they will be heavy!\n\nThere will of course be other friendly fighter units operating over the bridgehead at Sedan, so beware!\n
