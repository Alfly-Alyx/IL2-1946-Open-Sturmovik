Description May 28, 1940.\n\nThe British have started to evacuate their encircled units in the Dunkerque area - including Belgian and French forces as well. We estimate that as many as 300.000+ soldiers are trapped in there. This is a signal victory!\n\nAnd as the Panzers have been ordered to halt (many of the units are badly depleted) it has fallen on us in the Luftwaffe to stop the evacuation. It is a tall order, but we will do our utmost!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nToday we will do a big and aggressive Fighter sweep over Dunkerque. \n\nBe prepared for brisk combat, as the British are sending over large numbers of fighters to cover the evacuation. If we can win the air superiority, the fate of the BEF is sealed! Leave the beaches to the Stukas. Your job is to clear their way.\n\nThere are of course many Luftwaffe units in the air over Dunkerque, so be careful so you don't attack any friendlies.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis mission is pretty FPS-heavy, due to my attempt to build up the virtual IL-2 beaches at Dunkerque to look a bit like the real beaches did in late May 1940. \n\n\n
