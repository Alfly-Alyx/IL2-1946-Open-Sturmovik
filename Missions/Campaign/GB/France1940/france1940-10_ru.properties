Description June 5, 1940.\n\nThe pocket at Dunkerque has been eliminated! The Allies have withdrawn over the Channel, suffering big losses in men and, not least, materiel. \n\nI'm sad to say that our goal, to crush them completely from the air, has not been achieved. Most of the trapped soldiers got away, rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of 850 boats, many of them tiny pleasure cruisers and fishing boats. \n\nBut we in the Luftwaffe caused big losses for our enemies. Over 200 of the Allied sea craft were sunk, including nine destroyers and nine other large ships. The RAF lost 177 planes.\n\nAnyway, now we have turned our attention south again, towards Paris! The Wehrmacht have renewed their offensive on the Somme, and are already making some progress. \n\nYOUR MISSION\nIn an attempt to turn air superiority to air supremacy we have started "Operation Paula". We know that the French has gathered air units north of Paris, to use in this situation, and to protect their capital.\n\nWe want to knock them out!\n\nTherefore bombers will strike at several French airfields around Paris. Your task is to perform an aggressive fighter sweep over one of their biggest bases, the one at Creil.\n\nHeinkels will hit the base, and hopefully this will provoke the French fighters - who have been hard to find the last week - to rise to the occasion.\n
