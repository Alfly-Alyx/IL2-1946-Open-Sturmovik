Description May 22, 1940.\n\nIt has happened! Our Panzers has reached the English Channel, near Abbeville, encircling the British Army, and a large portion of the French one as well!\n\nThe Luftwaffe has a big part in this, especially the Stukas. \n\nOur Ju 87s have been particularly effective at breaking up attacks along the flanks of our forces, knocking out fortified positions, and disrupting rear-area supply chains. We have also benefitted from excellent ground-to-air communications throughout the campaign. Radio equipped forward liaison officers are able to call upon the Stukas and direct them to attack enemy positions along the axis of advance.\n\nAnother thing: welcome to our new base here at Merville! It is very close to the front. As you can see, the Stuka boys have made a mess of this one as well. So watch out for craters and potholes on the runway!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nOur forces are pushing the retreating British, French and Belgians towards the Channel. We want you to perform a fighter sweep towards and along the coast. \n\nAh, yes: report if you spot any concentrations of enemy vessels. That could indicate that the enemy is planning an evacuation.\n
