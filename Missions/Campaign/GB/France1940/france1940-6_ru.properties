Description May 19, 1940.\n\nMomentous successes! Antwerp has fallen. Brussels too. Our Panzers are continuing their rush towards the English Channel!\n\nOur High Command is very confident. They say that there appear to be no serious threat to our advance from the south. There is some talk about attacking Paris immediately, to knock France out of the war with one blow. The Allied troops in the north, leaving Belgium, are retreating to the river Scheldt, which exposes their flank to the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions.\n\nSoon this war will be decided! Every man must do his utmost.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nEnemy activity in the air has actually gone down a bit. They are not beaten, not completely. Intel thinks that both French and British are actually holding back their air assets, in order to use them when the big final battle starts. Which is soon!\n\nBut we shall keep the pressure on them. Therefore we want you to do another Free Hunt, this time over Cambrai, which fell yesterday. \n\nIf you find any enemy air units trying to attack our armoured spearheads, you must of course attack them!\n\n(And, yes, I almost forgot: we will soon switch airfield, to one closer to the coast!)\n\n
