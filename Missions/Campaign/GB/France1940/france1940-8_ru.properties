Description May 26, 1940.\n\nThe retreating BEF and French and Belgian units have been pushed into a big pocket on the coast, around Dunkerque. (It looks like they are preparing an evacuation after all.) The 10th Panzer Division are attacking Calais, and that city will soon fall. \n\nThe 1st Panzer Division is ready to attack Dunkerque, but rumor has it that the F\u00FChrer has ordered it to halt! Strange. It is also said that our highest commander, Reichfeldmarschall G\u00F6ring, has convinced the F\u00FChrer that we in the Luftwaffe can prevent an evacuation.\n\nSo you know we have a big task ahead!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe haven't seen much of the British bombers after the massacre over Sedan, but now they have started to fly missions in support of their hard pressed force around Dunkerque.\n\nWe want you to patrol the area between Dunkerque and Calais, and intercept all enemy bombers that you can find.\n
