Description Dawn, May 10, 1940.\n\nAt last! Our long and boring wait is over! The big offensive in the West is about to start.\n\nIn a move anticipated by many, the Wehrmacht will today invade Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium. This operation will be performed by Army Group B, under the command of Fedor von Bock. This Army Group has 26 infantry and three Panzer divisions at its disposal for this.\n\nThe operation is called Fall Gelb.\n\nOur unit will be at the nexus of the Belgian and French fronts, and will have to be ready to participate in both direction. For now the French front will remain silent, which is a bit strange. GHQ must surely have some trick up its sleeve.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAs per the doctrines of Blitzkrieg it is imperative to gain air superiority, so that our Bombers and Stukas can roam free over the battlefield. \n\nThe Belgian airforce - the A\u00E9ronautique Militaire Belge - is pretty meek. Before the war they started a rapid modernisation programme, but too late. Most of their equipment are of the biplane type. They only have some 50 aircraft that are of modern standards. \n\nWe aim to crush the Belgian airforce on the ground!\n\nSo early this morning your unit will hit a Belgian front airfield just outside Liege. Destroy as many aircraft as possible! \n\nYou will go in LOW, to achieve a maximum surprise effect. And keep radio silence!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nDon't forget to switch skins, if you want to fly int the same camo as your comrades: use "Yellow 13 swastika Bf109E4.bmp" by Canon_UK.\n\n
