Description Evening, May 10, 1940.\n\nThe operations are going according to plan. Luxembourg is for all intents and purposes in our hands. Many air raids have been conducted during the day against Belgian airfields and communication centres.\n\nOne of the key positions, the Fort Eben-Emael, south of Maastricht, is under assault by our airborne forces, and will probably soon fall. (And they bragged that it was impregnable...) The main Belgian defence line seems to have been breached and our units are passing through it rapidly. Some of the Belgian defenders are withdrawing rapidly, destroying the bridges over the rivers in the wake of their retreat.\n\nWe have a forseen complication: French and British armies have already crossed the border into Belgium and are rushing up to the enemy rear. \n\nYOUR MISSION\nThis evening a detachment of Fallschirmj\u00E4ger are going to be dropped on a important bridge over the river Sambre, well in the enemy rear.\n\nYouir mission is to escort the flights of "Tante Ju's" to their target and back, protecting them from all enemy fighters.\n\nSome Stukas will fly in support of the paratroop drop. Watch out so you don't shoot any friendlies.\n\n
