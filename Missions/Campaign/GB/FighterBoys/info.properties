Name Fighter Boys  - The Battle of Britain 1940
Description  This is a 14-mission static campaign portraying the fighting in the Battle of Britain during the month of August 1940. You are a rookie RAF pilot, just out of a hurried spell of conversion training. You have been sent to fill in the gaps that has recently occured in a Spitfire Squadron during the July fighting over the Channel. \n\nRegarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option. Also if you feel confident enough choose the "No Map Icons" option as well. It will give a MUCH more intense game. The rest is up to you. Regarding rank: start as "Flying Officer".\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have the AAA (All Aircraft Arcade) Mod installed, version UI 1.11. And Cannons new Channel 1940-41 map, also available on AAA.
