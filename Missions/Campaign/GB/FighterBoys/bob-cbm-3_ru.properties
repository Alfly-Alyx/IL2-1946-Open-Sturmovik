Description August 11, 1940. West Malling.\n\nThat was your first real dogfight, and you did good. Remember: never fly straight in a combat zone for more than 10 seconds. And keep your head on a swivel!\n\nNow you understand why they say that 1 hour of the real thing is worth 50 hours of training.\n\nSoon you will face bombers. Then you must know that the commander of our Group, 11 Group, Air Vice Marshal Park, has set out that individual squadrons are to intercept enemy raids. \n\nThe aim is to subject Jerry to constant attacks by relatively small numbers of aircraft, trying to break up the tight formations of the bombers. Once formations has gone to pieces, stragglers can be picked off one by one. \n\nWhen multiple squadrons reach a raid the procedure is as follows: the slower Hurricanes will tackle the bombers while we with our more agile Spitfires go for the fighter escort. Mind you, this is the ideal, and not always achieved...\n\nYes, another thing. You see that piggy bank over there? It's tradition in this squadron that every pilot put a few bob in there, and when someone goes in - you know, you never say "shot down" of a collegue, only say "going in" - we plunder the bank and have a drink for them at the mess in the evening.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nThere is a convoy, code name "Booty" off Harwich. Our Chain Home Radio Direction Finding facilities (I will tell you more about those another day) have picked up what appears to be a sizeable enemy force going towards it.\n\nWe, together with four other squadrons, are sent due east to meet the attackers.\n\nAny questions? No? Well then, let's get cracking!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the previous mission: on August 8 a big air battle raged over and around convoy "Peewit" as it steamed through the Channel towards the northeast. During this, Jaf\u00FC 2 sent a strong fighter sweep over the coast, and these became engaged by Spitfires from Squadrons 41, 64 and 65.\n
