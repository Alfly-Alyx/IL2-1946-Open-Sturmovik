Description August 18, 1940. West Malling. Morning.\n\nYesterday we had a bit of a breather. Phew! We needed that. Everybody is getting very tired, I know. I heard that almost no one went to the pub for a beer, that people just slept and slept.\n\nA piece of tactical advice. Some other squadrons have started to go for head-on attacks on bombers. You should try it yourself. It really works. \n\nWhen you shower those glass-house fronts of the Jerry bombers with fire from eight MG's, you can often see the whole nose crumble apart, pilots slumping down or staggering out of their seats to escape the hail of bullets. And then the aircraft inevitably goes down.\n\nBut it requires nerves of steel and a perfect timing. Or you will ram them.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWaves of enemy bombers are approaching from the south. We don't know what they are up to, and their course is a bit erratic. \n\nAnyway, our task is to the greet the Hun, and make his brief stay over Britains pleasant pastures green as nasty as humanly possible. \n\nAny questions? Gentlemen, climb into your aircraft!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the actions on August 16: German activity was on a reduced scale compared with that of the previous day. \n\nThe main activity consisted of two waves of attacks: First attacks launched between 1200 and 1430 hours against Portsmouth, Kent and East Anglian areas. Then a series of attacks launched between 1630 and 1830 hours against Dover and the Thames Estuary and along the South Coast between Shoreham and Selsey Bill. \n
