Description August 29, 1940. West Malling.\n\nThat last mission was a big success! Top hole! We and the other squadrons intercepting actually made the Jerry bombers turn around, without reaching their target. Splendid!\n\nToday it's been a day of showers and bright intervals. Clouds in the Channel and the Straits. It's also been another day of comparative calm.\n\nThese quiet spells are always welcome, for sure, because God knows that everyone is getting tired. But we also knows that it's the calm before the storm. Jerry always takes a short breather before lunging out at us, full tilt.\n\nYes, another thing. It's about the Bf110.\n\nAt the start of the war, this twin-engined fighter was expected to engage in air-to-air combat while escorting the Luftwaffe bomber fleet. It was really talked about.\n\nAlthough the aircraft is well designed and the best of its class, being reasonably fast (some  340 mph) and possessing a nice combat radius, the concept that the Bf 110 could defend bombers against a attack by a force of fast single-seat, single-engined fighters has - luckily for us - proven to be flawed. \n\nAnd you chaps have helped to prove that!\n\nWhen pitted against our Hurricanes and Spits the 110s has begun to experience heavy losses. As you all have seen they are only slightly more manoeuvrable than the bombers they were meant to escort and also suffering from poor acceleration.\n\nBut one thing: never go head to head with a 110. Their front armament is formidable!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nListen up! \n\nRDF has spotted some 20 enemy aircraft approaching land, obviously moving towards Rochester. Maybe they are aiming for the aircraft factory there?\n\nYour task is to intercept them. \n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the actions on August 26: At 1137 hours, five raids, totalling some 100 aircraft collected in the Gris Nez area. They approached to attack objectives in the Folkestone-Dover area and inland at Biggin Hill and Kenley. They were met by intercepting fighters, and by 1250 hours, the attackers turned around without reaching their intended targets, which was a major success for the RAF.\n\nA second attack on the South-East of England developed at approximately 1422 hours when some eight raids totalling 190+ German aircraft collected in the Calais - St Omer area. They crossed the coast in waves between Lympne and the mouth of the Blackwater and appeared to have as their objectives aerodromes in South-East England from Duxford southwards. At 1540 hours, some 250 aircraft were estimated to be north and south of the Estuary between Bury St Edmunds and Dungeness.\n\nThe Luftwaffe lost 35 aircraft during the day, the RAF 30. (Among them was 616 Squadron, that lost six Spitfires in a single combat.)\n
