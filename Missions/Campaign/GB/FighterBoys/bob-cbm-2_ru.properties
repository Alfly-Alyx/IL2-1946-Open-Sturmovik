Description August 8, 1940. West Malling.\n\nThat wasn't too bad. Who knows, you might make it after all. Also: get rid of that regulation tie. Use silk scarves instead. We don't wear them because they are fancy-looking. They protect our necks from being rubbed raw by that constant looking in all possible directions.\n\nYou have already learned one of the most important lessons, a lesson that our old CO - God rest his soul - never understood, stuck as he was in the pre-war textbook tactics. \n\nAnd that lesson is simple: you have to get in fast, get real close, at least 100 yards or so. And then get out fast!\n \nOkay, listen up chaps!\n\nThere is another convoy steaming up the channel. (Don't groan!) It's called CW9, codename "Peewit", consists of some 20 escorted cargo ships, going from Medway, through the straits up to Swanage.\n\nAnd yes, Jerrry is doing his thing again, throwing everything but the proverbial kitchen sink at it.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAlright, alright. Here's the good news: our job is not to escort those blasted coaltubs, but instead to shield those fighters from other Squadrons that are doing the actual escorting. \n\nWe know that a large formation of Jerry fighters are airborne, and they seem to be moving towards the Folkstone-Dover-Margate area. It's our task to intercept them, so that they can't attack the convoy escorts.\n\nTwo other squadrons are also being sent against this area.\n\nAny questions? Right. Lets go!\n
