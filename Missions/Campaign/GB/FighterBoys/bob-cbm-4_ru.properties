Description August 13, 1940. West Malling.\n\nOk, chaps, listen up. First something about your personal life. I know that some of you have wives or girlfriends quite nearby. Yes, we are literally defending hearth and home. But I am going to stop all pilots from living outside the base.\n\nIt is quite simply bad for morale. \n\nWait... I just got this message. Something big is afoot!\n\nYesterday there was a big raid on Portsmouth, and this morning Jerry attacked a number of our Radio Direction Finding stations at the coast.\n\nLet me tell you about Radio Direction Finding, or RDF. It's a nifty radio device (very hush-hush, you know) that can be used to spot enemy aircraft from a long way away.\n\nUsually the first indication of an incoming Jerry air raid is received by the Chain Home RDF  facilities that are located around the coastlines of the UK. (In most circumstances, RDF can pick up formations of enemy aircraft as they organised themselves over their airfields over in France.) Once the raiding aircraft move inland over England, the formations are also plotted by the Observer Corps. \n\nThis means that we don't have to patrol the skies, but can be directed towards the enemy formations, as they appear. This is a great advantage! But Jerry has obviously got wind of this, and is now trying to knock them out.\n\nReports from RDF tell us that a lot of German aircraft went airborne earlier today, but for some reason most of them turned around and returned.\n\nBut not all...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nA large formation of enemy aircraft are moving inland. Observers say that they are Stukas. A probable target is the airfield at Detling. And even though it doesn't belong to Fighter Command it must be defended. \n\nAny questions? No? Let's go!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the previous mission on August 11: there was very considerable activity during the day, the main features of which were a heavy attack on Portland at 1030 hours, four attacks on the Dover Balloon Barrage between 0730 and 1210 hours and attacks by large formations on convoys in the Thames Estuary and off East Anglia at about 1130 hours.\n\nSixteen squadrons were in action (some as many as four times) and shot down 32 (plus 46 unconfirmed) enemy aircraft while AA guns shot down a further 5 (plus one unconfirmed). In addition, a further 28 enemy aircraft are reported damaged. RAF losses were 25 aircraft (20 pilots missing and 2 killed).\n
