Description August 16, 1940. Back at West Malling.\n\nHorray! You have seen the papers, haven't you? \n\nThe RAF scored a total of 152 victories yesterday! Everyone is talking about the "Black Thursday" of the Luftwaffe. Ok, so the figures may be a bit exaggerated, for the purpose of general morale, but still: we did really good yesterday! \n\nA word of advice to you. We know that the performance of the Spitfire over Dunkirk came as a surprise to Jerry, although captured German pilots when interrogated still seem retain a strong belief that the 109 is the superior fighter.\n\nHowever, the Bf 109E has a much larger turning circle than either the Hurricane or the Spitfire. Both British fighters are equipped with eight Browning 303 machine guns, while the majority of Bf 109Es had only two machine guns and two (potent) wing cannons. \n\nThe Bf 109E and the Spitfire are better than each other in certain key areas. For example, at some altitudes, the 109 can out-climb the British fighter. \n\nIn general, though, the differences between the Spit and the Me 109 in performance and handling are only marginal, and in a combat they are almost always surmounted by tactical considerations: which side has the advantage of sun, altitude, numbers, pilot ability, tactical situation, etc.\n\nSo don't get cocky, even though the Spit is a wonderful machine!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAlthough they took a beating yesterday, the Luftwaffe is back in force. They are attacking airfields and RDF stations in Kent, Hampshire and Sussex.\n\nAn enemy force is approaching the coast between Eastbourne and Folkestone. Judging from the speed and altitude it's probably bombers.\n\nOur task is to intercept them.\n\nWatch out for the escorts! Even if you don't see them at first, they can still be around.\n\n*************************\nHISTORICAL  NOTES\nRegarding the last mission: there was a lot of action in the air on August 15. One of the most successful attacks was performed by the Do17's from KG3, which hit the Eastchurch airfield and an aircraft factory at Rochester. \n\nLosses to the bombers were low, due to the fact that the escort was strong, and that a fighter sweep by JG26 had distracted the defenders. The last mission tries to portray that portion of the battle, with RAF fighters running into the "Freie Jagd" of JG26.\n\nThe actual losses of the Luftwaffe on August 15 was 72 aircraft: the highest losses they suffered any single day during the Battle of Britan.\n
