Description August 21, 1940. West Malling.\n\nFirst, let me introduce you to our replacement pilots: Philip, who is a Canadian, and Karel, who is from Czechoslovakia. Thanks for being here. We need you. I know that more and more foreign pilots are joining up. Rumor has it that there soon will be a couple of all-polish squadrons operational.\n\nSecondly, we've had a couple of pretty peaceful days now. Jerry is obviously catching his breath now, content with sending over the usual swarms of fast recce aircraft.\n\nAnd today has been another quiet day, again with just some German reconnaissances active along the East, South and South West Coasts, where they also attacked some isolated objectives. Pinpricks really.\n\nBut now this evening something a bit bigger is obviously on the move.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nA steady stream of enemy aircraft is coming from Holland and Le Havre. Some are them are obviously aiming for the Estuary, and perhaps even London.\n\nA number of squadrons have been scrambled to meet them, including us.\n\nAs always, the bombers are a priority, but if there are Hurricanes around, let them deal with the twin-engined machines, while we attack the fighters.\n\nQuestions? Fine! Off we go.\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the actions on August 18: German activity resumed an extensive scale after the lull of the previous day. The action was particularly brisk on the south and east coasts.\n\nBetween 0908 and 0935 hours on that day, three reconnaissances were made over Dover and The Straits. Three further reconnaissances were made between 1042 and 1102 hours at about 20,000 feet to 25,000 feet up the Thames Estuary.\n\nAt 1230 hours, a heavy attack was launched between North Foreland and Dungeness and comprised some 300 enemy aircraft. It penetrated as far as South and South-East London, returning to the Calais area in scattered groups. The enemy aircraft came in three waves; the third, however, appeared to turn back near the coast. Kenley, Croydon, Biggin Hill, Manston and West Malling were attacked.\n\nAt 1430 hours, a secondary attack consisting of about 50 aircraft was directed towards Dover, but only about 12+ crossed the coast and these are reported to have attacked Dover balloons.\n\nAt 1700 hours, eight raids numbering 200 aircraft approached the coast between Harwich and Dungeness. The majority flew up Black Water and the Thames towards Rochester, Hornchurch and North Weald. The raids broke up on being intercepted and were forced out to sea by 1810 hours. The aircraft taking part in this raid assembled near St Omer and are thought to have come from Antwerp.\n
