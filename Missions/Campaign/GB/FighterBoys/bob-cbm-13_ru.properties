Description \u0020                           *** LAST MISSION ***\n\nAugust 31, 1940. West Malling.\n\nThis day will put strain on the proverbial stiff upper lipp. It looks like we are in for more heavy German attacks against our aerodromes and RDF sites. You have probably heard that Biggin was more or less knocked out yesterday?\n\nThis morning Jerry attacked North Weald, Debden (where some damage is reported), Duxford and East Kent area. Also German fighters shot down the entire Dover Balloon Barrage. Plus that single aircraft made recce flights over Martlesham, Bircham Newton and the Norfolk Coast.\n\nI know that you all are dead tired by now. We could all see Thomas falling asleep in the mess this morning, going face down plonk into his bacon and powdered eggs - yes, we all needed that laugh. And Gringo pancaking yesterday was due to him actually falling asleep by the stick - luckily he was just badly banged up, but his kite is a total wreck.\n\nBut I need you to hang in there, just a little bit more. I have applied to Group and then to Dowding for the squadron to be pulled out just a couple of days, to rest, and give the new boys at least a modicum of combat training.\n\nAnd this has been granted. Albeit grudgingly...\n\nBecuse we are losing the new pilots at a disturbing rate. Remember Lynley the other day? Shot down on his very first mission, and his parachute failed to open. Oh, his name was Dymley? Well, sometimes you never get to learn even the name of these new boys...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nListen up chaps!\n\nRDF reports that some fifty plus aircraft are approaching Dover. Judging from the pattern we have seen lately, they will head for some of the big aerodromes.\n\nWe have been detailed to give Jerry another warm welcome. The goal is to try and turn them around, before they reach their target. We know it can be done. We have done it before.\n\nAnd stay healthy! We can't afford to lose any more machines, and especially not more men. Try to avoid going over the sea - you know that the chances of surviving a dip in the Channel are slight.\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the actions on August 30: At 1106 hours that day, one hundred plus German aircraft passed over Dungeness and Dover, quickly followed by another wave of one hundred plus.\n\nThese formations split up over Kent and Surrey, sub-divisions attacking targets in the Estuary and the aerodromes at Biggin Hill and Eastchurch. At 1200 hours, another wave of one hundred plus German aircraft came in over Dover but did not penetrate far inland. Throughout the attack numerous hostile aircraft patrolled the Channel and French Coast, evidently waiting to cover retreating bombers.\n\nBy 1230 hours these raids were over.\n\nSixteen fighter RAF squadrons met the attack and destroyed twenty-seven German aircraft plus three by anti-aircraft, at a cost of ten aircraft and five pilots.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\n
