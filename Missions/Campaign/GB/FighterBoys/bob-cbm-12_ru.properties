Description August 30, 1940. West Malling.\n\nCalm down chaps, listen up. We all live in this strange daze of exhaustion, exhilaration and fear. But when it's time to scramble I want you to put all that behind you, and act sharp. That goes for you too Gerald!\n\nAnother thing: I've heard that flying sergeants have been seen in the mess of the Officer pilots. You sergeants have your own mess, and it's there for a reason. \n\nOk. Yesterdays enemy raids were just some sort of test raids, with almost no bombs being dropped anywhere.\n\nBut now the Hun is back, once again, and in the grand manner.\n\nWe are waiting for orders, and in Readiness, which means that we must be able to be airborne in five minutes. But let me use this waiting to remind you of a couple of things about the Spit.\n\nWe know that Bf 109 pilots succeed in keeping on the tail of the Spitfire in many cases, despite the latter aircraft's superior turning performance, because many of you boys fail to tighten up the turn sufficiently! \n\nThe gentle stall and good control under "g" of that bloody Bf 109 is of some importance, as they enable the Luftwaffe' pilot to get the most out of the aircraft in a circling dog-fight by flying very near the stall. Also: the Bf 109 has leading edge slats which automatically deploy prior to stalling.\n\nOk, here endeth the lesson...\n\nYOUR MISSION\nBetween 0740 hours and 0820 hours today, two Jerry raids of twenty plus each cruised in the Straits and Calais areas. Two squadrons sent up over the Straits did not sight either raid. Hostile patrols remained active in the Calais - Boulogne area.\n\nBut now we have reports of large formations of enemy aircraft crossing the south coast between Dungeness and Dover.\n\nSo we are going to get airborne and intercept them.\n\nAny questions? No? Lets go then - chop, chop!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the actions on August 29: At 1510 hours, nine German aircraft flew over Dover towards Tangmere; this raid was immediately followed by about 170 aircraft which appeared to head for Biggin Hill. \n\nThese raids, probably just a sort of spoof operations, or fighter sweeps, were contacted, but no serious fighting started, with just four aircraft being destroyed by RAF fighters and one anti-aircraft. Strong German patrols were maintained off Calais until 1725 hours.\n\nAt 1725 hours, a raid of twenty plus aircraft passed over North Foreland and flew towards Rochester. It was intercepted and four German aircraft were destroyed. All in all during the day the RAF lost 9 aircraft with 2 pilots killed or missing. \n
