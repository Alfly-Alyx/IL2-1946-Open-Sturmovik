Description August 26, 1940. Back in West Malling.\n\nYet another day of relative quiet, then Jerry is on again, full scale. Wonder if there is a pattern to this?\n\nAnother thing: I heard that some of you chaps slipped away to London again, doing the night spots in West End. I understand that you need the release. And I don't mind if you take a number of drinks, I don't mind even if you get plastered. As long as you are back and fit for duty in the morning! Understood? And please return in a safe way.\n\nAlright. Have you heard? Bomber Command has bombed Berlin!\n\nAbout time, if you ask me. OK, so Jerry seems actually to have been avoiding to attack civilian targets. But three nights ago bombs were dropped on Harrow on the outskirts of London. \n\nSo last night some 80 bombers of Bomber Command were sent out to raid targets in Berlin. I've heard from a guy that I know, that flies Wellingtons, that clouds prevented accurate identification and that the bombs were scattered all over the city.\n\nWe'll see how herr Hitler reacts to that! Some say that this will lead to an escalation. Perhaps.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nRDF reports that a large number of enemy aircraft have been assembling over Gris Nez, and are now heading towards the south coast.\n\nOur job is to intercept them. Remember: bombers are always a priority!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the actions on August 24: The main German activity consisted of six large raids which crossed the Kentish coast and in two cases flew up the Estuary towards London. A large number of enemy aircraft attacked targets in the Portsmouth area. Both Hornchurch and North Weald sector stations were badly hit.\n\nPreliminary reports stated that RAF aircraft destroyed 40 enemy aircraft at the cost of 20 to ourselves but only six of our pilots were lost. The actual losses for the Luftwaffe was 29.\n
