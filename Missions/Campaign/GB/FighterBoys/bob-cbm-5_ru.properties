Description August 15, 1940. Gravesend.\n\nGroup has shifted us to another airfield, in anticipation of new attacks. There is a lot of shunting of squadrons to and fro down here in 11 Group. It is rare that a squadron stays at a single airfield all the time. This will happen again. \n\nYes, it has begun in earnest.\n\nAll morning reports have been pouring in, telling us about attacks against our airfields: Hawkinge, Manston, Martlesham, Newcastle, Biggin Hill etc.\n\nYou remember what the Prime Minister said in that speech some two months ago?\n\n"What General Weygand called the Battle of France is over. I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin. Upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization. Upon it depends our own British life, and the long continuity of our institutions and our Empire. The whole fury and might of the enemy must very soon be turned on us. Hitler knows that he will have to break us in this Island or lose the war."\n\nThere you have it.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nOk, chaps. Listen up. A big enemy formation is moving towards Ramsgate. We don't know if it's bombers or fighters. But fearing another attack on the airfield at Manston, we can't wait until our Ground Observers can spot them.\n\nTherefore we, and another squadron of Spits, are going against them.\n\nQuestions? Fine. Lets go!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the last mission: weather delayed the opening of the German attack on mainland Britain, Adlertag, ("Eagle Day") until 13 August 1940.\n\nThe day opened with a series of attacks, led again by Epro 210 on coastal airfields used as forward landing grounds for the RAF fighters, as well as satellite airfields, including Manston and Hawkinge.\n\nIn the afternoon of August 13 Ju 87 Stukas appeared in force to attack coastal radars and various airfields. Among the raiders were 40 Stukas from IV(St)/LG1 that targeted the airfield at Detling, that got badly damaged.\n\nThe day cost the Luftwaffe a total of 43 aircraft, while the RAF lost 14.\n
