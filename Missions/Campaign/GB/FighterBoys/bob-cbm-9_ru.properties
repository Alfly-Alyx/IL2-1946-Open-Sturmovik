Description August 24, 1940. Detling.\n\nOk, kill that gramophone. I think all by now have heard Connie Boswell singing "Marta" and "The Nearness of You". And listen up.\n\nTwo more quiet days. We have been moved to Detling, as reinforcements from the north needed our aerodrome temporarily, as Debden has been put out of action, due to the bombings.\n\nAnyway, the respite seems to be over for now. \n\nLarge enemy formation are coming in, both over the North Sea and the east, and over the Channel and the southeast.\n\nBut while we wait for orders from Group, I want to talk tactics a bit. Look at the black-board here.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the top brass in Fighter Command were not expecting to see single-engine fighters over Britain, only bombers. With this in mind, they cooked up a series of "Fighting Area Tactics", involving a series of intricate manoeuvres designed to concentrate a squadron's firepower to bring down bombers.\n\nWith no apparent prospect of escorting fighters to worry about, we have been educated to fly in tight, vee-shaped sections of three. You know, "vics". These restrict squadrons to tight 12 aircraft formations in another tight "V". \n\nWith this formation, only the squadron leader at the front is free to actually watch for the enemy; the other pilots have to concentrate on keeping station. It's too rigid. It doesn't work.\n\nBy contrast the Germans employ a loose section of two, based on a leader followed at a distance of about 200 yards by his wingman, who also flies slightly higher and is trained to stay with his leader. \n\nWhile the leader is free to search for enemy aircraft, and can cover his wingman's blind spots, his wingman is able to concentrate on searching the airspace in the leader's blind spots, behind and below. Pretty smart, eh?\n\nWe are all acutely aware of the inherent deficiencies of our old tactics. \n\nWe are now trying out a compromise, whereby squadron formations use much looser formations with one or two "weavers" flying independently above and behind to provide increased observation and rear protection.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nAh, yes. Alright men, we now know more. The Jerry formations that are approaching over the North Sea obviously aims for the area to the north of the Estuary.\n\nOur task is to intercept them. It is a large force of twin-engined bombers, mainly Heinkels, escorted by both 109's and 110's. (By the way: no one has spotted a single Stuka for a number of days now. I wouldn't be at all surprised if they have been withdrawn after that last massacre.)\n\nAny questions? Fine! Good luck. Here we go!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the actions on August 21: In the evening that day a strong German formation, consisting mainly of fighters, made a sweep over Kent and the Estuary, some penetrating to the eastern boundary of Central London. During the day RAF fighters destroyed 2 enemy aircraft (plus 1 probable plus 6 damaged). RAF casualties were nil.\n
