Description August 18, 1940. West Malling. Afternoon.\n\nThat was a nasty surprise!\n\nWe've heard about Jerry using this tactic before, but we have never actually seen it applied. \n\nThe trick that they are playing on us is as follows: \n\nJerry has obviously understood that we are using RDF and other facilities to track them, especially large bomber formations. So they have started to experiment with a sort of "stealth" fighter formation, that shadows the approaching bombers.\n\nSo when our control sends up fighters to intercept, Jerry control vectors that "stealth" group towards our fighters, as if to meet them. \n\nBut then the whole group of enemy fighters suddenly change course completly! And fly flat out to another place, usually an airfield, and strafe it.\n\nThis is what happened to us. We will have to be aware of this threat from now on.  \n\nOk... You all heard that bloody phone ringing. The balloon is up, once again.\n\nThey are obviously going for our sector station airfields, those bastards.\n\nAt 12:52, our aerodrome here at West Malling received some HE and incendiary bombs, and we have taken some damage, but the shop is still open for business. \n\nBut more enemy raids are on the way.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nTwo waves of enemy bombers have been spotted as they work their way from the coast towards the north. As it looks now, their target is probably some of the big sector station airfields in the vincinity of London: possible Biggin Hill (again!) or Kenley, or even Croydon\n\nOur task is to intercept the bombers, and make them pay. \n\nYes, this has turned into a battle of attrition, and right now we are shooting down more of them, than vice versa.\n\nQuestions? Lets go then!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nThe info about German "stealth" tactics comes from playtester DoctorWho, who in his turn got it from a Battle of Britain veteran, whose airfield was strafed in this manner three  times. \n\nThe veteran also told DoctorWho that later they only sent up half their aircraft to attack the bomber formations, because others had to fly around their field to protect it "just in case" German fighters was going to strafe them.\n
