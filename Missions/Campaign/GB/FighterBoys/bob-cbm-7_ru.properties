Description August 18, 1940. West Malling.\n\nYesterday we had a bit of a breather. Phew! We needed that. There were only a couple German recce aircraft doing their rounds. And this morning was also quiet, with only some enemy recce missions over Dover and The Straits being reported. \n\nBut now the balloon is up, once again.\n\nThey are obviously going for our sector station airfields, those bastards.\n\nAt 12:52, our aerodrome here at West Malling received some HE and incendiary bombs, and we have taken some damage, but the shop is still open for business. \n\nBut more enemy raids are on the way.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nTwo waves of enemy bombers have been spotted as they work their way from the coast towrads the north. As it looks now, their target is probably some of the big sector station airfields in the vincinity of London: possible Biggin Hill (again!) or Kenley, or even Croydon\n\nOur task is to intercept the bombers, and make them pay. \n\nYes, this has turned into a battle of attrition, and right now we are shooting down more of them, than vice versa.\n\nQuestions? Lets go then!\n\n************************\nHISTORICAL NOTES\nRegarding the actions on August 16: German activity was on a reduced scale compared with that of the previous day. \n\nThe main activity consisted of two waves of attacks: First attacks launched between 1200 and 1430 hours against Portsmouth, Kent and East Anglian areas. Then a series of attacks launched between 1630 and 1830 hours against Dover and the Thames Estuary and along the South Coast between Shoreham and Selsey Bill. \n
