Description August 7, 1940. Redhill.\n\nSo you are the new chap, eh? Well, we need all the pilots we can get. We have no lack of aircraft, but we do lack trained men.\n\nAnd I guess that's the rub.\n\nPilots have been drawn from Bomber Squadrons, and the Naval boys, as well as from the Auxiliary Air Force and the Volunteer Reserve. I've heard that you have very little experience with Spits, the conversion programme lasting only two weeks. Someone said that you've only done three landings, before being posted with us. Corblimey!\n\nMadness if you ask me. But I guess we have no choice. Adolf won't wait until you have completed a proper training.\n\nSo, the last weeks we have been through some pretty sticky fighting over the Channel. And lost a number of men - that's why you are here. Also, we have been rebased to Redhill. All the aerodromes at the coast are only used for emergency purposes now. They are too vulnerable for regular use.\n\nJerry is attacking all our convoys that are racing through, and have been sinking a large number of ships. Those bloody convoys are another piece of madness if you ask me. They should have been cancelled weeks ago, but it seems that they insist on running them, well... out of prestige. England rules the waves and all that.\n\nAugust has opened quietly though, and we have had a couple days without combat.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe just MUST get you some more flying time, before you are thrown into the fire. \n\nYou know that chaps like you, with little actual flight training and often no gunnery training whatsoever, are cannon fodder. Here today, gone tomorrow. Charlton was exactly like you. He went in yesterday. It's his bunk you will be sleeping in tonight.\n\nSo, sunshine, if you want to still be alive in a couple of weeks time, do EXACTLY as I tell you. No heroics. No antics. And keep your eyes peeled!!!\n\nYou will follow me down the coast, over Folkestone, just a simple patrol. To get you some stick time. We have had no reports of Jerry activity, except for some lone recce aircraft, doing their usual rounds over the coast.\n\nAny questions? Fine. Lets go!\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\n1. In order to simulate the fact that you are a green pilot, just struggling to survive your very first air combat, in this and a number of mission that follow, the mission is completed if you just land your aicraft back at the base again.\n\n2. Canons map is a marvel, with lots and lots of ground objects, and in order to ease the strain on your PC I've decided to dispense with all "for show" air and ground activities. Only those air activities that you can actually see from your cockpit will be there. The rest will be mentioned in briefings.\n\n
