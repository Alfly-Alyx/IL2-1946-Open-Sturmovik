Description BLUE - Finland, december 10th, 1939.\n\nI had a nightmare.\nI was accused of treason. They tied me to a pole and blindfolded me. Just as I heard the shot of the rifles I woke up soaked in sweat.\n\nI've spend an hour on the toilet and my hands are shaking. I've got to pull myself together.\n\nToday my wingman Eino Juutilainen and I will take our B-239's and escort a flight of Blenheims on their attack on a russian factory complex.\n\nGeneral heading towards the target is northeast and cruise altitude is 7000 ft.\n\nEstimated time over target : 13.06.\nEstimated time at home base : 13.15.\n\nWeather : good, ceiling : 1000 m.\n
