Description RED - Spain, april 12th, 1938.\n\nI just woke up and I feel very puzzled to say the least.\n\nI remember the official ceremony where we received our wings.\nI also remember first part of the party later in the evening - and I remember that I had a lot to drink.\nBeer, wine, whiskey, champagne.\n\nThat's about all I remember.\n\nToday they want Jose Martin Redondo, Luis Torres and me to take three Gladiators and cover an important friendly train travelling eastward on the railroad from Sevilla to Malaga down south.\n\nWe will climb south to 1000 m until we cross the railroad, follow it southeast, turn north before reaching enemy lines and finally head home northwest.\n\nEstimated time at home base : 9.19.\n\nWeather : clear, ceiling : 1000 m.\n
