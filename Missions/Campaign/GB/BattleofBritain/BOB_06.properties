A supply truck rumbles by on the way across the tarmac to the repair hangars. The 601 Hurricanes sit waiting just 30 feet away, fueled, armed and ready to fly. \n\nThe headquarters door swings open and one of the few uniformed females on the base steps outside, sergeant stripes on her sleeve. "601,  A and B - you're up!" She shouted. " We just got a call from RAF Control, we have inbound bombers headed for the Portsmouth area... Middle Wallop is on active standby and Spitfires on patrol from Warmwell are being re-routed!"\n\n"Remember to watch out for those barrage balloons!" She shouts, as you and your group sprint for your Hurricanes.\n\n**Use "Tangmere601_2" skin.**\n\n
