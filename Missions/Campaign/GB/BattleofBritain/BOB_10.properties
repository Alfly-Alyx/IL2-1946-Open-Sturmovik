A nudge on your elbow makes you turn, "hi Johnny..."\n\nHe nods, "hey mate, got a fag and a light?" The look of exasperation on your face reminds Johnny he's asked you that question before, "right-o, you're the bloke that don't smoke... sorry mate," he grins sheepishly.\n\n"Ok lads," shouts Sir Archibald over the engine noise, "43 just tool off to head for Weymouth. Your flight is headed to Portsmouth. We just got a call from RAF Control... a submarine patrolling in grid "I-6" has a visual on a flight of 20+ inbound bombers with escort. They are plotted into the Portsmouth area. A patrol of Hurricanes out of Northolt will be joining you, watch for them." He slaps your shoulder, "good hunting Lads, now get going!"\n\n\n**Use "Tangmere601_2" skin.**\n\n
