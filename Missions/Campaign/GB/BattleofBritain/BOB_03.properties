Name Battle of Britain - Hurricane Season_03
Short Thursday, July 11, 1940.  \n\nHurricanes intercept bomber raid over the Isle of Wight.\n
Description DATE: Thursday, July 11, 1940 - 8PM\n\nWEATHER: Overcast most of the day with scattered rain, breaking clouds in the late afternoon.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: Early this morning there was an attack on a shipping convoy by Ju 87's and Bf 110's. This afternoon a flight of Bf109s was intercepted and turned back by Spitfires. Enemy attacks continue up and down the coast. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, MESS HALL: \n\nYesterday's action over the Channel was satisfying, thrilling, you finally got to meet Jerry and kick him in the arse. The bonus was being able to deny him any serious damage to the convoy you were assigned to protect. Today was a different story though... everytime your flight arrived at it's intercept coordinates, the action had moved.\n\nBut tomorrow would be another day you thought, eating and listening to the conversation around the table. Most of it revolved around the two favorite pilot topics; women and flying. The food was somewhat bland but hot and so you ate, it was filling, besides, a little salt & pepper worked wonders.\n\nThe room dropped to instant silence when the mess hall phone rang, all eating stopped, forks suspended in mid flight...  \n\nAn administrative clerk close to the phone grabbed it off the cradle. "Mess Hall... right, right," he nodded, listening intently.  With the phone receiver still in his hand, he jumped to his feet. "Radar's  tracking an incoming raid!  601 - you're up!  SCRAMBLE SCRAMBLE !! Hurry up lads!"   \n\nChairs crashed to the floor, silverware rained down on the tables and you and your group sprinted out the door and to your Hurricanes,\n\n\n**Use "Tangmere601_2.BMP" skin.**\n\n\n\n\n\n
