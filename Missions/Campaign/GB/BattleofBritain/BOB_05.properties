Name Battle of Britain - Hurricane Season_05
Short Tuesday, July 16, 1940.  \n\nConvoy Protection.\n
Description DATE: Tuesday, July 16, 1940 - 9AM\n\nWEATHER: Cloudy with fog.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: July 14 - July 16...Westland Aircraft factory at Yeovil was bombed. Continued harassment by enemy bombers on Allied shipping, means convoy protection is crucial. Overnight heavy rain prevented night raids.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, MAIN HANGAR:\n\n"Morning lads..."  Sir Archibald was standing  in front of a jeep parked in the hanger, a steaming cup of tea sat on the bonnet next to his clipboard. He picked up the clipboard and flipped through the pages of reports as he spoke...\n\n"Sunday night, bombers foraged inland into the Westland area and bombed one of our aircraft factories in Yeovil... it was damaged, but I hear production will continue and things should be shaping up by the end of the week there. " \n\n"Other than our shipping , it doesn't seem the Jerries have any particular pattern yet,  it's been hard to determine what their next move will be. Thankfully the radar has been very helpful in giving us time to get interceptors into place. Yesterday  the Jerries took another stab into Westland but the weather was so bad they missed their target completely. RAF Control  decided not to risk any of our kites in the soup and the gamble paid off."\n\n"Today's visibility is not very good but it's better than yesterday and  the Jerries are sure to be up looking for shipping targets... so we're going to be up looking for them. Flights from Exeter and St. Eval  will also be operating in your area. Try to bring your kites back in one piece."\n\n"Dismissed and good hunting."\n\n**Use "Tangmere601_2" skin.**\n\n
