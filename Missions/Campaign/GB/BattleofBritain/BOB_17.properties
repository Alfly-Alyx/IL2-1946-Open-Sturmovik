Name Battle of Britain - Hurricane Season_17
Short Sunday, August 18, 1940.  \n\nSub Chasers...\n
Description DATE: Sunday, August 18, 1940.   6:30AM\n\nWEATHER: Mostly Cloudy, scattered fog. Clearing after daybreak for overall good visibility.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: Friday, August 16, extensive attacks all along the southern coast. RAF Tangmere and Southampton harbor damaged. Saturday, August 17, severe drop-off in enemy air activity. Limited hostile reconnaissance flights logged, little action overall. RAF Command reports an emerging problem; a shortage of pilots. Raids have damaged many radar sites creating serious gaps in our early warning system, Saterday's lull proved to be helpfu in restoring some damaged systems to use.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, MESS HALL:\n\nWarm toast with jam, eggs, a bit of bacon and a spot of tea... such were the little things that bought comfort in the early hours of the morning... before the sirens, the bombers, the dying and the killing... \n\nLauren sat with a couple of other women from the administrative pool at a table across the hall from where you sat with your fellow pilots. For a moment you locked eyes and exchanged smiles.\n\n"Fair looking bird you've got there, mate," commented Johnny, before sipping his tea.\n\n"What...? Only fair...?" You objected with a wry smile. \n\n"Alright mate," he grinned, biting into his toast, "downright smashing."\n\nYou grinned as you peppered your eggs. "She is, isn't she..."\n\n"Quite", he replied, "serious?"\n\nYou looked up across the room at her as you ate, watching her with her friends, "I think so..."\n\n"You going to ask for her hand?"\n\nJohnny's question surprised you. "During this mess..? Are you kidding?" You shook your head, "not until this bloody business is over..." You said it but you weren't sure you believed it yourself.\n\n"If you've thought about it, I wouldn't wait... think of all the things that could happen in this bloody mess..."\n\nYou nodded, "I know, I've thought of that, that's why I want to wait... I'm afraid of leaving her alone if something happened to me." \n\nJohnny shrugged, "she'd be alone either way... at least if she were your wife, she would have your service benefits." He poured himself another cup of tea. "I met the Vicar in town at the Red Lion last week and we lifted a few pints. I'm betting if you slipped him a couple Quid, he'd set it up off-base so knowbody knows and hold the license at the church for safe keeping..."\n\nSir Archibald stopped at your table. "morning lads,  I've got an early escort for you... a little change of pace." You started to push away from the table. "No,no," he corrected, "finish your breakfast, we've got to wait for the bombers..." \n\n"Bombers? What's the target?"\n\n"It seems a U-Boat has had a bit of a mechanical letdown outside the Isle of Wight - must have been skulking about, waiting for some habor traffic... One of our PBYs spotted him about 6AM, he's sitting on the surface. We thought we'd send a couple of kites out to help him submerge." He smiled at his own joke. "Just accompany them out and back."\n\n**Use "Tangmere601_2" skin.**\n\n
