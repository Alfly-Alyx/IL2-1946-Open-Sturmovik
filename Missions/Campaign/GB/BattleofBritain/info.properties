We are promoting you to the rank of Flight Officer. You have been assigned to RAF Tangmere to fly Hurricanes with Squadron 601. At RAF Command, we realize your training was short but you are needed in the air to defend Britain, in what is expected to be a fight for the very existence of the English people. Our Victory is paramount and to achieve that, your survival is key. No heroics, the loss of materiel and manpower is something we can ill afford. Therefore, you will do your utmost to bring yourself and your assigned aircraft home after every mission. Feel free to make use of any of our neighboring bases in an emergency, but get your kite on the ground in one piece. Listen to your Flight Leaders and learn from them, it may save your life. Good luck and good hunting. Dismissed.\n\n
