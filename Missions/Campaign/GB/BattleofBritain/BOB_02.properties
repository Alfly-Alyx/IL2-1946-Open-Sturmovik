Description DATE: Wednesday, July 10, 1940 - 5PM\n\nWEATHER: Soggy, intermittent rain, some heavy.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: The Luftwaffe has attacked targets all across Great Britain's coast. There's been a 70-bomber raid on Swansea and Falmouth. RAF Martlesham airfield in Suffolk has been bombed. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF TANGMERE, BRIEFING ROOM:\n\nGranted it had only been a couple of days since your arrival at Tangmere, but you'd been up four times without  seeing one Jerry plane... you weren't sure whether to be aggrivated or relieved. The Battle of Britain had begun early this morning and the action seemed to be avoiding you.\n\nWhen your group entered the briefing room Sir Archibald was sitting on the corner of the desk, fiddling with his pipe.\n\n"We're in the thick of it now lads," he said, looking up, "the Jerrys have attacked targets all across England.  I know some of you are a little inexperienced... Just remember your trainig and stick with your wingleader... I don't want to see any bloody stupid heroics - no wandering off chasing Jerrys on your own, because if they don't get your arse, I will!" \n\n"Our Hurricanes aren't as fast as those Me109s but they're a damned sight more maneouverable,  so remember that advantage. Do try to bring your kites back without any holes in them, eh?"\n\n"Right then, down to business... We have a nervous Commander of a supply convoy about 15 miles off-shore that spotted a Jerry observation plane following the column. Take your flight out there and keep an eye on those ships. A couple of Spits from 152 Squadron out of Warmwell, will be joining you."\n\n"Keep a sharp eye out - good hunting lads."\n\n**Use "Tangmere_601_2.BMP" skin.**\n\n
