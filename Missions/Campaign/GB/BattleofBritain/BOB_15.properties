Name Battle of Britain - Hurricane Season_15
Short Tuesday, August 13, 1940.  \n\nAIR RAID!\n
Description DATE: Tuesday, August 13, 1940.   4:00PM\n\nWEATHER: Totally overcast, rain expected.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Tangmere Airfield.\n\nSITUATION: Monday, August 12, Portsmouth bombed. Tuesday morning, August 13th, one formation of 55 Do 17's bombed Eastchurch airfield. Oldham, Farnborough and Detling airfields also attacked.  Raids have damaged many radar sites creating serious gaps in our early warning system.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nLEAVING THE RED LION INN, IN TOWN:\n\nIt was the first time-off you'd had since you arrived at Tangmere and the first date you'd had since you entered flight school, months back. Leave it up to the damn Jerry's to ruin your best plans for the evening. \n\nLauren was a cute little blond, one of the few women on base, an administrative steward in the main office... and your charm had snagged her. Drinks and appetizers were all you had time for before the air raid sirens. \n\nLauren made short work of the drive from the Red Lion back to Tangmere, her little MG careening through the countryside. The air raid sirens were wailing here too, and planes were lining up for takeoff as you came screaming across the apron. It looked like organized chaos, planes from mixed squadrons taking off as fast as they could.\n\n"There - there! Stop there!" you pointed. Tires squealing, Lauren brought the little MG to a quick stop between a Hurricane and a brand new Spitfire. "Nice driving..." you grinned.\n \n"Be careful," she urged, giving you a quick kiss as you opened the door.\n\n"Warm the tea darling," you smiled, "I'll be back shortly." You closed the door and looked around for a ready plane. You simply couldn't pass up the opportunity to fly that beautiful new Spitfire and sprinted around the car.\n\n"Hey mate... you can't fly that one!" Shouted a mechanic working under the neighboring Hurricane. \n\n"Sergeant, Is it fueled...?" You yelled.\n\n"Yes sir, but..."\n\n"Is it armed...?" You yelled, pulling the chocks.\n\n"Yes but..."\n\nYou  jumped up onto the wing and slid the canopy open. "Then up she goes...!" You replied.\n\n"But Sir...!" Yelled the mechanic coming out from under the Hurricane, "she doesn't belong to us! She's not ours - she's going to Warmwell...!"\n\n"OK...!" You nodded and waved, pretending not to understand.  Quickly sliding the canopy closed, you pulled the choke with one hand and pushed the starter button with the other.\n\n"The mechanic waved his arms as he ran towards your Spitfire..."that's not our plane! If you scratch that kite it's your arse! ...Sir!"\n\nYou nodded, because all you could hear was the sweet sound of the Rolls Royce Merlin as it came to life. The mechanic was a comical figure, standing there waving his arms, his mouth moving with no sound. With a spike of adrenalin and joy you nudged the throttle and the Spitfire began to roll. It was like stealing a car with the owner chasing you down the street. It was a good thing the chute and vest was sitting on the seat in the cockpit, but since you had already started to roll, you weren't quite sure how you'd get it on.\n\nWell, better bring this thing back in one piece then, you thought. You savored that wonderful "new plane" smell as you throttled up.\n\n\n**Remember to release chocks for takeoff.**\n**Use "BOB_SpitMkVb.BMP" skin.**\n\n
