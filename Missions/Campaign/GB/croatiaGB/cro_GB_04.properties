Short attack Italian thanks\n
Description \n07.04.1941\nBosanski Aleksandrovac\n\n11:00h\n\nWe are still on our own, lines are still down. Well, with all that sabotaging going on it is no surprise. Most of our AA guns are disabled, planes have weird malfunctions... How they expect any decent defense that way.\n\nMessenger just arrived and apparently Italian 2nd army is pushing toward Karlovac. Our 7th have hard time trying to stop them.\n\nOur mechanics managed to arm  planes with  250SC bombs so try to block the roads with destroyed thanks.\n\ngood luck\n\n2nd Brigade\n4th Regiment\n34th Group\nCO\nmaj.
