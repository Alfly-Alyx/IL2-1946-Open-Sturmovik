Name Medenine
Short \nThe artillery duel at Medenine\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nBen Gardane\nTunisia\nNorth Africa\n06th March 1943\n\nThe Afrika Korps are launching an all out assault against the 8th army at Medenine. Stukas and artillery are in action in support of the panzers which are attempting to break through the allied lines.  The defences set up by the 8th army are excellent though and German tanks are being picked off by our well dug in artillery.  Since this morning's attack, they seem to have run out of steam without getting anywhere near our own tanks which were held back from battle.  It's now 15.35 hrs and Jerry is renewing his attacks, but I think there is only going to be one result this time.  Everyone is feeling very confident of victory.\n\n244 wing, in common with other RAF units in the area are flying numerous sorties over the battle area, hunting for stukas and any other luftwaffe units that are operating there.  It seems I've arrived back on ops just in time for a major ding dong air battle.  Neville Duke has already begun adding to his bag.  He'll be tour expired soon and I'll be surprised if he doesn't take home a DSO this time.  \n\nThe weather's a bit marginal for operations today, there's been quite a lot of rain and that usually causes problems out here with the landing grounds often becoming waterlogged and unusable but we have to do our best to put up a good show. desert template by VPMedia\n\n\n .\n\n\n
