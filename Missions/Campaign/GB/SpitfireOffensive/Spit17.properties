Name Stooge patrol
Short Fly a patrol over Northern Sicily and look for targets of opportunity\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nCasabile\nSicily\nJuly 23rd 1943\n\nAfter the first few days of operations over Sicily, enemy air opposition dwindled completely to nothing and there was little for the spitfire squadrons to do other than stooge around providing the usual top cover for the ground attackers or go down for a little strafe ourselves if we saw anything interesting.\n\nWe moved to Pachino on the 13th, becoming the first allied squadron to land on Italian soil and since then we have flown numerous, rarely eventful sorties to add our presence to the overwhelming weight of allied air power in the region.\n\nThe weather is baking hot most of the time, but life in Sicily is much more pleasant of course than life in the desert or even Tunisia.  The local people we have come into contact with are very friendly and seem more like a liberated population than a conquered one.  Perhaps Mussolini and the Rome-Berlin axis weren't the popular choice here after all.\n\nI've just been told to quit scribbling and get moving.  Who said that rank has it's privileges.  There's always someone bigger than you to boss you around.  We're required for a late afternoon show over Messina in the North.  Messina is the axis escape route out of here and onto mainland Italy when the time comes, which I don't think will be far away.  Anyway, if we see the bombers safely out of the target area we can go and have a sniff around the foothills near Mount Etna to look for any worthwhile ground targets.\n\n\n
