Name Spitfire Offensive
Description This campaign is set in Tunisia, Sicily and Italy during 1943 and 1944.  You have already two successful tours under your belt with 80 squadron in Greece and later flying Kittyhawks with 112 squadron in the desert.  Now you have returned for a 3rd tour, this time flying the Spitfire as the allies drive the axis from North Africa and prepare to invade Southern Europe itself.  Best plan for semi historical results is to fly it full hard but disable 'no instant success' in your options. There's nothing more annoying than flying a succesful sortie then landing and shutting down only to find that you have to refly it because you missed a waypoint or something. Any problems or queries please feel free to e-mail me at EAF602Whizz@aol.com and I'll try to help.
