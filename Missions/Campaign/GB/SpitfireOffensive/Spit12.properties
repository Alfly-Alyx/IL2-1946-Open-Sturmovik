Name The enemy withdrawal
Short Axis forces are pulling out of Mareth\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nHasbub\nTunisia\n27th March 1943\n\nLast night's attack at the Tebaga Gap caught the enemy off guard.  They weren't expecting us to attack at Dusk.  Quite out of character for the British to do such a thing and with the low sun in their eyes the German and Italian anti tank gun crews were at a disadvantage.  By 1800 hours our tankers had broken through the enemy defence lines and swept aside any interference from the panzer units.\n\nDuring the night the tanks reached El Hamma, directly in the rear of the Mareth line and  the only choice remaining to the Germans and Italians was to withdraw Northwards or be surrounded and captured.\n\nEnemy forces are now retreating along the coast road from Mareth while our troops and tanks try to close the gap against some fanatical rear guard actions.  For us in the desert air force it means pursuit once again of the enemy motor columns as they flee North to another defensive line.\n\nMore low level strafing of troops and soft skinned transport then, a duty that I have never managed  to acquire a taste for.  Most of the low level work is done by the fighter bomber types while we fly as cover but often we'll make a pass or two if the situation calls for it.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n\n
