Name End of tour
Short Your tour with 92 squadron is almost over.  This weekend you will be far from the fighting again.\n
Description \n92 squadron\n244 wing\nTriolo\nItaly\nNovember 1943\n\nIt seems that the Luftwaffe are never around when 92 are in the air these days, which has left us flying a series of seldom memorable patrols in increasingly miserable weather as the Winter begins to turn on us.  Our lot is to fly top cover for the Kittyhawks and Bostons, just as we did last Winter in North Africa while they carry on with their familiar role of hitting at the entrenched defences of a well trained, hardened enemy.\n\nI won't be here much longer.  Word has come through that my tour with number 92 squadron is over.  This weekend I'm to be flown back to Malta and thence to heaven knows where.  Probably a spell instructing, or worse still, the boredom of staff headquarters.  Has it really been three years since I was posted to Greece with 80 squadron and its venerable Gladiator biplanes.  So much has happened since then, it feels more like 3 lifetimes have gone past.\n\nI've managed to plan a final road recce this evening with Group HQ, though I'm setting a bad example by pulling rank.  If a less senior officer had tried it with me I'd have told him firmly but politely that he was staying away from spitfires for a while.  \n\nWe'll fly up North and see if we can catch an enemy supply column coming out of hiding.  They tend, wisely, to move around at night, but we might catch them at twilight if we're lucky.  In addition, the area we're going to reconnoitre has a small railway yard which, although it's been bombed recently is still a useful part of the enemy supply network.  \n\nWith the allied armies stuck on the seemingly impregnable 'Gustav' line it's going to be a long hard Winter here in Italy.  I suspect that, unless there is a serious outbreak of sanity in Berlin the war will last another year anyway.  The dangers of our losing are in the past but there is still going to be a bitter, protracted struggle fought in the months ahead.   Perhaps I'll be back in Italy flying Spitfires again before it's over.\n\n\n
