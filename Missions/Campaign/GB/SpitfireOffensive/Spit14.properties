Name Wadi Akarit
Short During a patrol along the coast near Gabes, you are called in by an RAF forward controller to attack some dug in  88mm flak/anti tank guns.\n
Description \n92 Squadron\nHasbub\nTunisia\nApril 5th 1943\n\nThe enemy have fallen back on the area around Akarit which presents some serious geographical problems for the tactical heads in 8th army.  The terrain is ideal for defence and in their weakened state, heavily outnumbered as they are, it is just what the Germans and Italians need to help even the odds stacked against them.\n\nIn real terms what that amounts to is the death and injury of hundreds of allied soldiers.  The enemy have dug a long, wide anti tank ditch which is flooded and heavily mined in the hope that our tanks will die on it like flies on sticky paper and all the time, while our armour tries to negotiate this obstacle they will have to endure the cross fire from the dug in 88mm guns.  \n\nSince the early hours of this morning Indian and Scottish infantry divisions have been in close contact with the enemy defences along the Roumana ridge, while at Wadi Akarit,a few miles to the East, more Scottish battalions have advanced and captured forward enemy positions only to be pinned down by heavy machine gun fire.  Despite these bloody setbacks, British armour has succeeded in reaching the ditch and a break through appears imminent.\n\nIt is late morning and 92 squadron are patrolling the area near the ground fighting when a call from a desperate RAF forward controller is transmitted.  The RT set crackles in our ears, 'Hello this is rover, are there any fighters available to attack enemy machine gun nests at Roumana?  Stand by please for the exact coordinates.'\n\nOur flight dips and turns towards the North East even as we confirm our availability.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n\n
