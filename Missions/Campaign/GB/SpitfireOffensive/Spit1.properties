Name 3rd operational tour begins
Short \nWith the Tactical Air Force in Tunisia.\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nBen Gardane\nTunisia\nNorth Africa\nMarch 1943\n\nAfter 4 months rest back in Alex, I have returned to the fight in North Africa for a 3rd tour of ops.  We are no longer stuck in the Western desert doing the old Benghazi handicap backwards and forwards, the fighting has now moved right across Libya and into Tunisia where the Germans and Italians are making what looks like their last stand.  \n\nThe desert air force and 8th army where snapping at their heels the whole time, preventing them from organising a strong defence.  Even Tripoli was taken back in January after little more than a token resistance from Rommel.  All the while, during the army's pursuit of the enemy across Libya, we enjoyed almost constant air superiority, although losses remained heavy.  With the spitfires available now, It's a far cry from the old days when the 109s had our poor Tomahawks for Breakfast, dinner and tea. \n\nI have joined number 92 squadron out here, which is equipped with Mark Vs.  Neville Duke, whom I flew with in 112 Squadron last year is in charge of 'A' flight.  He has built up quite a respectable score since I last saw him and he's recently been awarded a bar to his DFC.  We are currently based at Ben Gardane, having been shelled out of the forward airfield at Medenine.  Our aircraft had to evacuate under heavy artillery fire during a German counter offensive and with 92 and 145 squadrons both scrambling to get off the deck at once it's amazing there weren't any mishaps.  \n\nWithin hours of arriving at Ben Gardane I was flying my first sorties in Tunisia to acquaint myself with the area.  Yesterday I began flying proper offensive patrols over enemy held territory.  Already I feel very much at home here and that I've fitted in well with the other pilots and personnel of 92 Squadron.  We are applying heavy pressure on axis airfields in the region, taking advantage of our numerical superiority. 92 squadron are taking off shortly to beat up the enemy airfield at El Hamma and I'll be going with them for what ought to be my first serious action since last November at Alamein.\n\n'British air superiority threw to the winds all our operational and tactical rules.  The strength of the Anglo-American air forces was, in all the battles to come, the deciding factor.'\nRommel.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n.\n
