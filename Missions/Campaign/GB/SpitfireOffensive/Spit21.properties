Short \nWe are to escort B24 Liberators returning from a raid\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nItaly\nSeptember 1943\n\nThanks to American airborne landings in the most threatened areas, the allied invasion force at Salerno finally managed to break out from the beachhead to link up with 8th army.  Since then progress Northwards has been steady, with the Germans carrying out their now familiar fall back onto one prepared position after another.  They don't give ground easily and when they do it's only to set up another hard line of defence on which to crucify us.\n\nOur staple diet these days consists of 2 or 3 sorties a day flying escort for the fighter bombers of 239 wing or the tactical medium bombers such as Marauders or the Mitchells.   There isn't much action for us on these sorties.  No fighter action at all just now.  Just stooging backwards and forwards, searching the sky and watching the bombing patterns on enemy airfields or bridges or railyards.  Whatever unfortunate patch of ground has been highlighted at ops planning.\n\nThere's a bit of low cloud today to cover fighter bomber activity, not that there's much danger from the air anyway, still you never know.  I'm going to take another spitfire on an armed recce of enemy railways and roads to the North West.  A rhubarb in other words, hit and run like hell before the flak gets clever.\n\n\n
