Short While flying top cover for Kittyhawks, 92 squadron encounters a large formation of transports\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nLa Fauconnerie LG\nApril 20th 1943\n\nThe 1st army in the West and the 8th army in the South East have pushed the remaining axis forces further North into Tunisia to yet another defensive line.  The 8th army have been attacking near the coast at Enfidaville since yesterday, so far without any sign of spectacular success.   As always, the Germans and Italians are skilfully dug in and fighting tenaciously to hold every hill and wadi in our way.  It looks as if, despite allied numerical superiority and the hopelesness of the enemy position, this will continue to be a painful war of attrition until we grind them down to almost nothing.\n\nIncredibly, Hitler and Mussolini are pouring equipment into Tunisia which is going to be lost in a matter of weeks along with an entire army.  Thank God they didn't think of making this kind of effort when we were on the ropes back in Egypt.  \n\nA flight of the new Spit Mk9s from our squadron were patrolling the Cap Bon peninsula a few days ago when they encountered a large formation of Italian transport aircraft with fighter escorts.  The 3 Spitfires attacked and shot down 5 SM82s without loss despite the fighter escort.\n\n2 days later we were flying a sweep over the same area as top cover for 4 squadrons of Kittyhawks.  This time an enormous enemy transport formation was intercepted and while the Spits held off the escorts the Kittyhawk pilots massacred the transports, claiming over 70 Ju52s either shot down or damaged.\n\nNow we are once again to fly as top cover for the Kitties over Cap Bon.  We are all in the mood for a good hunt and hope that this time it will be our turn to annihilate another chunk of Hitler's transport fleet.\n\n\n\n
