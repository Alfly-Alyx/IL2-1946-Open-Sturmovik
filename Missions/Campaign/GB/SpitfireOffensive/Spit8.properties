Name Assault on Mareth
Short \nThe 8th army has begun a full scale assault on enemy positions at Mareth.\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nHasbub\nTunisia\nNorth Africa\n21st March 1943\n\nThe 8th army are attacking entrenched German and Italian armies at Mareth.  While our Spitfires fly top cover, the medium bombers of tactical air force are constantly attacking the Mareth defence line and the fighter bombers are going in low to attack the enemy armour and gun positions.   \n\nThe Jerry fighter airfield at Fatnassa took a hammering this morning and a lot of their Me109s were wiped out on the ground.  Since late February we've been continuously attacking their airfields in the hope of gaining complete air superiority during the coming battle for Tunisia.  The result has been a tangible lessening of enemy air power in the region.  Several important enemy aces have been killed and their squadrons are greatly weakened by relentless attrition.\n\nI've been enjoying a bundle of magazines that were sent to one of my fellow pilots in 92.  The Aeronautics magazines are especially popular, especially the articles on what the enemy are saying about the air war.  You'd think we'd all be sick of aeroplanes and flying but a large proportion of us are here because it's what we always wanted.  Not many of us stumbled into it by accident.\n\nA large group of enemy tanks are threatening the New Zealand division operating near the Matmata hills South of Mareth.  Kittyhawks and Hurricanes are being sent in to attack the armour and we've been called on once again to fly top cover.  With the pounding the enemy airfields have been getting I doubt if there'll be much for us to do except stooge around.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n\n\n
