Name Dawn over Salerno
Short \nA sweep over the allied beachhead at Salerno\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nGrottaglie\nItaly\nSeptember 12th 1943\n\nA few days ago the Italians surrendered unconditionally to the allies.  The next day, 92 squadron along with the Kittyhawks of 239 Wing moved over to our new base near Taranto.  Since arriving here however there has been little evidence of the enemy air force contesting the skies of Southern Italy.  We have flown daily sweeps and escorts up the Adriatic coast over the heads of the advancing 8th army as far North as Foggia, but still the Luftwaffe refuse to come out and play.\n\nWhile in the coastal areas around the South of the country the allies have had a relatively easy time of it, the Anglo-American landings at Salerno have run into serious trouble where they've come up against some crack German units who are well dug in to the surrounding hills.  Counter attacks almost forced them right back into the water but luckily some gallant actions on the parts of American troops held the line.  Which is just as well because there would have been nowhere to go except into the bag for most of them.  Even though we grumble about our grub some of the time, noone much fancies prison camp food for the duration.\n\nWe are flying a combat patrol at first light over the front lines to see if there's anything doing. There's no point getting complacent just because the Luftwaffe are keeping a low profile at the moment.  They'll reappear and probably give us a nasty shock if we lose our edge.\n\n\n
