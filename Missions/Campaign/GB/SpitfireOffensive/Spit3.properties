Short \nAnother sortie over the Medenine area as the Luftwaffe struggle to gain local air superiority\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nBen Gardane\nTunisia\n07th March 1943\n\nThe New Zealanders and the Scots gave Rommel's army hell during the attempted counter attack at Medenine yesterday. If the enemy had hoped to put off their expulsion from Africa, they must have realised by now that their actions have had the opposite effect by giving us the chance to wear them down faster.  When they withdrew they left over 50 wrecked panzers behind.  That's reckoned to have been around a quarter of their remaining force.\n\nAs the enemy tanks return to their own lines there seems to be a determined effort being made by the luftwaffe to obtain local air superiority over the Medenine area.  There have been reports of Me109 fighter staffeln being rushed in from other parts of the country.  It's a day of large scale air fighting with numerous encounters taking place between our fighters and enemy Me109s and Macchis.\n\nIt's been a busy morning and I'm feeling pretty tired out already.  We're just having a quick brew up before the next sortie over Medenine.  At least the rain is letting up a bit after yesterday's adverse weather which hampered our operations.  \n\nI take a mouthful of the tar like substance and smack my lips, smiling gratefully.  As if this infernal liquid  tasted anything like the tea I used to enjoy before the war.  Condensed milk! Well I suppose you can get used to just about anything if you're stuck with it for long enough.\n\nWe throw the last few dregs onto the hard, stony ground followed by one or two cigarette ends spinning earthwards and we begin walking over to our Spits.  'Once more into the breech' grins my number two as he climbs up onto the starboard wing of his aircraft.  A 21 year old Flight Sergeant from the Midlands.  He's been with 92 for nearly a year so he ought to be rested soon. If he's tired or twitchy at all though, he doesn't seem to know it.\n\nI grin back and offer a quick v sign as I haul myself up into my own MkV with it's hard won row of swastikas and fascisti painted beneath the cockpit.  I wonder briefly if I'll add to that row of painted trophies today, or if someone else has the idea of adding me to theirs.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n.\n\n
