Short \nAnother low level airfield attack, with 92 squadron flying cover for Kittybombers.\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nBen Gardane\nTunisia\nMarch 09th 1943\n\nThe signs are good that we are going to kick Jerries arse out of Africa once and for all and do it soon.  For this afternoon's show, we are going to attack the Italian airfield near the coast at map reference E2.  There's bound to be some seriously dicey flak so the Kittybombers from 239 wing are going to make a quick attack, drop their bombs and strafe anything that crosses their sights then keep on going till they're well out of range.   I know from my own time with 112 Squadron that these battlescarred survivors have learned their tactics the hard way, through painful experience.\n\nOur job is to keep an eye out for the German and Italian fighters.  These guys are no amateurs either.  They have some very experienced killers flying the latest Me109Gs and the Italian Macchi pilots are the cream of the Reggia Aeronautica's fighter pool.  We may have Spitfires now to fly and fight with but they are only tropicalised MkVs, not the latest or best.  Luckily for us the recent bad weather has made operations from their airfields all but impossible today, so there shouldn't be much opposition.\n\nThe flak of course is an entirely different story.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n
