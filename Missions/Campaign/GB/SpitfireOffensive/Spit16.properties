Name Operation Husky
Short The invasion of Sicily has begun\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nLuqa\nMalta\nJuly 11th 1943\n\nThe fighting in Tunisia finally came to an end on May 12th when the last of the axis forces surrendered.  In the weeks beforehand the blockade of enemy supply lines made any lasting defence of Tunis untenable and only a suicidal last stand would have been possible, which of course would have been what Hitler would have wanted.\n\n150,000 German and Italian prisoners were taken;  Battle hardened veterans who would have been invaluable to the enemy plans in the coming battle for the European mainland.\n\nSince the carnage that we inflicted on the German transport formations back in April there have been few encounters with the enemy air forces.  Allied numerical superiority renders any such engagements hopelessly one sided.  The German and Italian aircrews must be exhausted by the scale of opposition.  Hell mend them I say.  They enjoyed air superiority over Warsaw and Rotterdam and Belgrade a few years ago.  Now the shoes on the other foot they can find out what it feels like.  I remember all too well what it was like in Greece when the odds were against us.\n\nAs for 92 squadron, in the last weeks of the battle for Tunisia we flew top cover for the Kittybombers and sometimes for the twin engined medium bombers of the desert air force. After the axis collapse we relaxed for a few weeks at Ben Gardane before flying out to our new base in Malta.  From there we have been flying sweeps and escorts over Sicily, which is the stepping stone to Italy itself of course.  \n\nYesterday an unprecedented allied invasion fleet landed on Southern Sicily, dispelling any doubts and rumours about the focus of the invasion.  So far reports indicate that the enemy defence is disorganised and only light resistance has been met by the 8th army at their landing grounds, although signs of a more determined counter attack are evident now.  Little attempt has been made by the Luftwaffe or Reggia Aeronautica to interfere with the operation.  Again, I expect that once the enemy get over the shock of the invasion there will be a stronger effort made to attack our beacheads and our fleet.\n\nWe were the first RAF squadron to patrol over the beachhead yesterday morning and ended the day with a couple of Ju88s confirmed.  We are now setting off on another combat patrol to provide cover for our troops in the area around Syracuse.\n\nNote: because of limitations caused by the use of a Crimea map in lieu of a map of Sicily and Malta, this is an airstart mission and it also ends in the air.  Hit escape anytime you like after you get the mission complete message.\n\n\n
