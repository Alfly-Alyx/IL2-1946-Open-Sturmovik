Name Gabes again
Short Another strafing attack on the axis landing ground at Gabes.\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nHasbub\nTunisia\n23rd March 1943\n\nAfter the unfortunate events of the past couple of days at the Wadi Zigzaou the attempt to break axis defences at Mareth appears to have stalled for the time being, although heavy fighting continues.  It is still clearly only a matter of time before we are able to swamp the enemy with sheer weight of numbers and force them out of their foxholes in the hills, hopefully outflanking and capturing them in the process.  It'll be a great feeling when we finally end this campaign in North Africa after years of disapointments and false dawns. \n\nI wonder what the Generals have planned for the next few days.  There's a feeling that something decisive will happen and with recent events in Russia and the Far East as well as here in Africa, there is a sense that a turning point in the war has been reached.\n\nExcellent news for 92 squadron;  a batch of Spitfire MkIXs has been allocated to desert air force.  Some are going to the Polish fighting team and others are being shared out among the various squadrons in the wing including 4 for 92 which are ready to be collected from Algiers.\n\nIn the meantime, we are tasked with another airfield attack, this time on the enemy landing ground at Gabes.  Take off is in ten minutes so I'd better put my diary away for now.  It wouldn't do to fly on ops with this in my pocket, too much handy gen for Jerry to get his teeth into.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n\n\n
