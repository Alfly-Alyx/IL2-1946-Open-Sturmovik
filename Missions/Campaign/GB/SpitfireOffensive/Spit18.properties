Name The straits of Messina
Short A close support sortie near the town of Messina\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nCasabile\nSicily\nAugust 14th 1943\n\nAugust has seen the allied armies continue their advance across the Island of Sicily while the German and Italian defenders have fallen back on one defensive position after another to cover their retreat.  As Patton closes in on Messina from the West and Monty from the South around Mount Etna, the enemy are carrying out their anticipated evacuation to the Italian mainland.\n\nThere is still little opposition from the air although several crack German fighter units are stationed in the region.  Again it's a case of their being so heavily outnumbered they can rarely find a chance to get there fighters up off the ground.  I almost miss the old luftwaffe these days.  I suppose they're a bit tightly stretched between Russia and the Channel and here, not to mention home defence now that the German industrial centres are being regularly bombed.\n\nOur old friends in 112 squadron are going to hit German troop and tank concentrations near Messina.  Our squadron has been tasked with providing top cover for the attack.  I doubt if we'll be needed but if it looks like a good idea at the time we'll go down and lend a hand with the ground targets.  Jerry flak is as dangerous as ever so maybe we can take some of the heat off of the Kitties.\n
