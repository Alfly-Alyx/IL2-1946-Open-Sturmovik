Name The Gafsa Road
Short \nA fighter sweep along the Gafsa road, hunting for enemy motor columns.\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nHasbub\nTunisia\n17th March 1943\n\nThings are happening.  The Americans have begun advancing towards the coast in rear of the Mareth line.  That ought to give Von Arnim food for thought. Heavy fighting is taking place near Gafsa. Meanwhile the attack on Mareth from the East by 8th army is likely to begin any day now.   It's less than a year since we had our backs to the wall at El Alamein and it seemed then that Rommel might have put an end to us when he sent us reeling back across Egypt in tatters.  Few of us imagined how radically the whole outlook of the war would change in a fairly short space of time.  On every front in every corner of the globe the axis have been pushed back or at least checked.  The biggest news of course apart from the victories in the desert and the Vichy territories has been the German disaster at Stalingrad.  Hopefully soon we'll be celebrating no less a disaster for the enemy here in Tunisia.\n\n244 Wing is being kept very busy flying constant offensive patrols and escort missions, sweeping the enemy airfields in our area while the light bombers and fighter-bombers are carrying out their low level attacks to deplete the Luftwaffe and Reggia Aeronautica units facing us.  There are allied fighter squadrons patrolling all the time, making jagdwaffe operations a near impossibility.  Italian air assets are virtually non existent most of their squadrons having been wiped out by bombing.  Meanwhile the heavies are making sure the enemy aircrews don't get too much beauty sleep when they tuck in at night.  Our task in the weeks ahead will be to make them aware that they are fighting a lost cause in Africa and for them it's either get off the continent or get in the bag.\n\nThe softening up for the big push continues and 92 squadron are about to head out on a sweep along the Gafsa Road, hunting for enemy mt convoys...and the hunting here, despite every effort at camouflage, is nearly always good.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n.\n\n
