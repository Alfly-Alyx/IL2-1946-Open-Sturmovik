Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nHasbub\nTunisia\nMarch 28th 1943\n\nThe 8th army have outflanked the axis forces blocking them at El Hamma and are now moving quickly Eastwards towards Gabes and the coast.  Unfortunately most of the axis army have escaped encirclement at Mareth to a new defence line at Akarit where they are already digging in for a siege.  \n\nAlthough the enemy have escaped this time, they are only a shadow of what they were even as recently as last month when they got ready for the battle at Mareth and came close to a convincing victory at Kasserine.  With the Allied air forces and navies cutting their supply lines from Sicily, the Tunisian campaign is like an open artery for the Germans.  The timing couldn't be better now that the red army has taken the initiative in Russia.  \n\nOur pilots have begun to encounter fresh enemy squadrons which have been rushed in from other fronts to try to cope with the huge numbers of British and American aircraft that they are facing.   \n\nWe're going to take a look at Gabes airfield and see what the situation is there in light of the axis withdrawal.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n\n
