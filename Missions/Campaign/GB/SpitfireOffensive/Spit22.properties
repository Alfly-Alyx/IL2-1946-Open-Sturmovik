Name Focke Wulfe fighter bombers
Short \nIntercept a raid by German fighter bombers\n
Description \n92 squadron\n244 Wing\nTortorella\nItaly\nOctober 1943\n\nI've just been roused from my slumber for a dawn patrol.  Life here in Italy is far pleasanter than what we were accustomed to in North Africa.  It's nice just to be back in Europe, and in such a pleasant part of the continent too.  The food and the wine is a welcome change from what we are used to and the people are friendlier too.  They love their music and the women of all ages are graceful and beautiful (and they know it).  What a marvellous country this is.  I think I'm falling in love with it despite the war.\n\nWe have been asked to patrol in strength over the front line.  German Focke-Wulfe 190 fighter-bombers have become a nuisance in our area and the army want Spitfires to cover them against possible air attack.  Pilots are already shuffling bleary eyed out to the dispersal wagon.  I stuff a map into my flying boot and follow them outside to be greeted by the beautiful sound of an Italian dawn chorus.  The trees are full of birds waking up to the new day.  Early birds like ourselves.\n\nRosy fingered Aurora begins to light up the sky to the East as we clamber into the back of the truck and then we are lurching across the field to our fighters in their blast-proof pens.\n\n\n
