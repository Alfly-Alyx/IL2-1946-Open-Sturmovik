Name Wadi Zigzaou
Short The bridgehead on the West bank of the Wadi Zigzaou is under heavy attack from enemy armour.\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nHasbub\nTunisia\nNorth Africa\n22nd March 1943\n\nOver the past couple of days the 50th division has been attempting to hold a bridgehead across the Wadi Zigzaou, a muddy watercourse with steep treacherous banks that forms a natural obstacle to 8th army ambitions.  The poor sods have been practically wiped out by counter attacks from enemy armour and most of the 40 or so tanks that managed to cross the wadi have been lost.\n\nHeavy rain has once again grounded our air forces and we are unable to lend any support to the troops trapped in the bridgehead.\n\nI've decided to make the attempt in any case.  It's quite possible, although a bit tricky to get a couple of Spits up for a quick recce over the battle area to try to have a shufti at what's going on.  If I get the chance I might manage a strafing run or two, just to remind the panzerarmee afrika who'se really in charge these days.\n\nThe weather is giving us no quarter and the airstrip is partially waterlogged but they're going to let me have a go anyway.  Even the sight of a couple of low strafing Spitfires might help to swing things in our favour if we can pull it off without breaking our necks.\n\nWe point the noses of our two Spitfires into the wind and our tails soon lift from the stony landing ground in a cloud of wet spray.  As we bump into the air the wheels tuck smartly up into their wells and we set course toward the battlefront.\n\nDesert Template by vpmedia\n\n\n\n\n
