Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nItaly\nOctober 1943\n\nIt is evening and I am returning from an eventful patrol over enemy frontline postitions.  We were escorting a squadron of Kittyhawks and attacking enemy motor columns when suddenly someone called the break.  I pulled hard away to the right and the squadron was scattered to the winds as several dark, streamlined shapes came flashing down through our formation, their cannon and machine guns flickering.   Miraculously, noone was lost in that initial attack and we rallied to protect ourselves and the Kittyhawks (although they were spoiling for a fight).  \n\nIn the event, the skirmish fizzled out as quickly as it began without bloodshed on either side and I found myself alone in the sky.  I called on the RT to try to find some of my aircraft, no reply, only static that sounded as dead and lonely as the rain.  I called to base.  Again, only the fizzing in my ears of a distant storm.  I set course, because now fuel was becoming scarce and I had to find a landing ground.\n\nDarkness and weather are closing in on me and it begins to dawn on me that I might be on a bit of a sticky wicket.  I look at the fuel gauge and at the darkening hills, wreathed in clouds.  I listen intently to the sound of my Merlin and I worry quietly to myself as I draw, all too slowly southwards.\n\nI must be over the allied lines now I think to myself and I wonder if there are freindly soldiers below me, staring up into the clouds towards the solitary engine.\n\nI stare ahead into the gathering murk, hoping for a landmark.  A familiar river or mountain or a town that I can recognise.  I've got to land soon, or bale out.\n\n\n
