Short \nA strike on Fatnassa airfield\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nBen Gardane\nTunisia\nMarch 08th 1943\n\nGeneral Von Arnim, now that Rommel has gone back to Germany,  has assembled his forces along the Mareth line of fortresses to stop the 8th army in the South East.  Ironically these were built by the French to defend themselves against an Italian invasion.  Thanks to their shortened supply routes the enemy have been pouring reinforcements into the area from Sicily, enough to allow them the luxury of launching a series of spoiling attacks against the allied armies that are now besieging them.  These mini offensives are costly to the enemy tanks however, a commodity they can't afford to throw away.\n\nThe Kitties and the Hurri-bombers are as busy as ever in their low level role in the desert attacking enemy armour while the Spitfires take care of the battle above their heads.  The purpose designed anti tank Hurricane IIds of number 6 squadron are proving especially effective in their assigned role of neutralising the panzers.  In recent operations in aid of General LeClerk's free French, the Hurricanes lent excellent support by decimating the axis columns sent to attack them.\n\nAmerican P40 units are prominent now in the air battle and have been joined by a French P40 Groupe de Chasse, flown mainly by former Vichy pilots.  Apart from the Spitfires, Kittyhawks and Hurricanes, our American comrades in arms are bringing P39 Airacobras, P47 Thunderbolts and twin-engined P38 Lightnings to Tunisia.  These aircraft have already been blooded in combat and appear to be giving a good account of themselves as long range fighter bombers.\n\nAn interesting component of our own 244 wing is the 'Polish fighting team'.  A group of over a dozen crack Polish pilots led by the ace Stanislaw Skalski.  They have been attached to 145 squadron to form C flight.  Owing to the reputation they achieved from the Battle of Britain onwards great things are expected of them.  I await tales of their prowess and derring do with great anticipation.\n\n92 squadron have been given the task of escorting a strike by Mitchells against JG77s base at Fatnassa airfield this afternoon.  We are to keep a lookout for American fighter bombers which are also operating in the area.  Another sign that the net is beginning to close on the axis armies now that our operations are beginning to overlap with those from the West.\n\nDesert Template by vpmedia\n\n
