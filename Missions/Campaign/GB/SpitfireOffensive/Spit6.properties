Short \nAn early morning escort for RAF Bostons bombing horseshoe ridge.\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nHasbub\nTunisia\nMarch 13th 1943\n\n92 Squadron has moved back to Hasbub, which is now considered safe from enemy ground attack.  It's early morning here and not yet quite daylight.  I am enjoying my usual Dawn cup of char and re-reading a recent letter from home.   How important these letters are when you're stuck out here, far from the familiar towns and villages.  The simple things that I used to take for granted; an evening in the pub, a walk in the woods or on a country lane, being able to drive a car without having to search the sky for marauding fighter-bombers.  It's funny to read all the little moans from home about the blackout and rationing when you're in a wet hole in the ground under rotten canvas, after another night of disturbed sleep from an enemy bombing raid.  \n\nI hope I don't sound as if I'm moaning, just missing home comforts I suppose.  It's been a long time since I've seen a bit of anything green and pleasant.  Even during breaks from ops I find myself in the heat and garishness of a strange land with strange sights and sounds and even stranger food.  There's not much chance of me 'going native' out here.\n\nWhile the army are completing their build up for the assault on the Mareth line, the Desert Air Force is applying constant pressure on the enemy to subdue and demoralise them.  Not that they're showing any signs of giving up.  If anything the Germans and Italians seem to be pouring more troops and equipment into Tunisia when they should be trying to evacuate.  The army fellows that I've spoken to say the German soldiers are fighting more fanatically than ever now that their backs are against the sea.\n\nIn the area around Mareth, the 8th army build up is being harmpered by enemy artillery in the hills overlooking them.   We're going to fly close escort for some Bostons bombing the area around 'horsehoe' ridge.  Hopefully this will help to make the desert rat's encampments a slightly more comfortable place to lay their heads than it's been for them lately.\n\nThe air is very still and cold outside the tent as I pull on my flying boots and get ready for the first of today's operations.  Take off is in less than an hour so I have to head over to the ops tent for the briefing.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n\n\n\n
