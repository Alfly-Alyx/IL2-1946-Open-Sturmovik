Name The Tebaga Gap
Short 8th army are breaking through enemy positions at the Tebaga Gap\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nHasbub\nTunisia\n26th March 1943\n\nA funny thing happened over Gabes airfield the other day which is worth a mention.  Flying Officer Savage was chasing a 109 low across the airfield during our attack when some squarehead on the ground fired a red flare.  He must have thought that he was an Me109 pilot about to land with his wheels up.  Needless to say he's been drawing the attention of some of the squadron's wags and providing us all with some much needed mirth.  \n\nThe 8th army have wisely switched their attack from a frontal assault on Mareth to a flanking attack at the Tebaga Gap which is further south.  For days now the New Zealand troops have been facing a German panzer division and have made very little progress through enemy minefields with artillery fire coming down on them from hills on either side.  However with the arrival of the 1st armoured division , things have taken on a different complexion there.\n\nIt is just after 1500 hours and we have been tasked with providing escort for 239 wing's Kittybombers who are going in ahead of our armour to bomb and strafe enemy positions.  In the absence of enemy fighter opposition (and following recent attacks on their landing grounds, I doubt if there's much left) we can add the weight of our own cannon and machine guns to the ground attack.\n\nThis is it!  The beginning of the end in North Africa we hope.\n\ndesert template by VPMedia\n\n.\n
