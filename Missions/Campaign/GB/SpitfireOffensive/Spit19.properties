Name Invasion of Italy
Short This Morning the allied armies began their invasion of the Italian mainland.\n
Description \n92 Squadron\n244 Wing\nLentini\nSicily\nSeptember 3rd 1943\n\nRested and reequiped with the latest Spitfire MkVIIIs 92 is back in the front line to cover the 8th army as it lands in Southern Italy.  Churchill has finally got his invasion of the 'soft underbelly'.  \n\nWe were up at the crack of Dawn this morning to provide fighter cover for the crossing of the straits and have been flying a standing patrol since then.  The Luftwaffe are bound to show up eventually. They can't ignore an allied invasion of mainland Europe.\n\nThe Italian people have shown that they have no love for fascism or the nazis and it looks as if Italy will soon be out of the war altogether now they have Mussolini under arrest and Badoglio in charge of the government.  I don't think the Germans will pull out without a fight though.  They can't afford to leave Italy because that would put the allied armies right on their doorstep.  I can see some grim times ahead as we advance further into the country and leave the Southern coast behind us.  This will probably make Tunisia and the desert campaigns look like a holiday in the sun.\n\nWe are taking our shiny new Spitfires up again to continue our non-stop patrolling over the landing grounds.   The familiar desert camouflage is gone now and we have adopted a European style paint scheme of dark green and sea grey.  The MkVIII is some machine though, far superior to the old MkVs with their great big vokes air filters grafted on under the nose.  These new Spitfires are in a different class. \n\nUnfortunately, now that we have what we regard as the best fighters there are very few Me109s to try them out against.\n\n\n\n
