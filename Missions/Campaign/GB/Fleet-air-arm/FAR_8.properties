Name Arrival at home port!
Short You've made it! This afternoon you will arrive at your home port and be transferred to a shore station\n
Description You've made it! Your luck, skill and bravery have paid off. Today the remnants of your convoy will arrive at the anchorage of your home port. One last catapult and a short flight to the nearest airbase. Once arriving you will get a short leave and some well deserved rest. After you return from leave you will be transferred to a shore based field. You will not have to endure(hopefully) any more landings in the drink and the long wait for a launch from the ship to fish you out of the water. Congrats for a job well done. Dismissed!\n
