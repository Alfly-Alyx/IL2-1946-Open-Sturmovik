Name Incoming JU88s
Short Intercept a pair of JU88 bombers before they get to the ships.\n
Description Good job on the last mission. The FW200 is a formidable aircraft. You did a fine job ditching your aircraft in the sea. A stiff drink and dry clothes should set you right for your next flight.\nThis afternoon, radar has spotted two incoming blips. They are probably German bombers as no allied aircraft have been reported in the area. Get up there and knock them down. Good luck.\n
