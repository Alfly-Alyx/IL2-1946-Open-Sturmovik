Name Sub Hunt
Short Fly an antisubmarine patrol\n
Description There has been a submarine shadowing the convoy for the past two days. Last night the tanker Mobile Bay was sunk. The lookouts are certain they caught a view of the sub this morning. While we dont have any depth charges for your plane, you will be of service to draw fire away from the PBY which is on its way. AA defense has been beefed up on the U Boats recently to combat allied aircraft. After launching, you will fly to the south east to meet the PBY. Fly just ahead and above or below the PBY As you approach the U Boat, wait for it to begin firing. Fly in ahead at top speed ahead of the flying boat and strafe the sub to keep the gunners down. Hopefully you will be able to keep the U Boat gunners distracted so the PBY can get in close to drop depth charges. This wil be a very challenging mission. Good luck.\n
