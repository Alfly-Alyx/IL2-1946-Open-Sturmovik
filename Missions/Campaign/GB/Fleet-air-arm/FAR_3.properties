Name September 8 1941
Short Escort PBY to the mainland\n
Description During the last convoy attack, a couple of ships were hit. One was sunk and two were badly damaged. Two of the officers from your CAM ship were badly injured in the raid and must be evacuated to a hospital on the mainland for better medical attention. A PBY has been sent out to the convoy to pick up the officers and get them near the mainland. The PBY will set down just offshore to meet a boat that will get the officers to dry land Due to the importance of the officers and the activity of Luftwaffe aircraft, it has been decided to take the risk of launching your plane to escort the PBY so it can make the trip safely. After the PBY is safely landed, you will land yourself at a nearby airfield. Enjoy the rare opportunity to walk rather than swim from your aircraft at the end of the mission. This afternoon, the PBY will return you to the convoy so it can continue on its way.\n
