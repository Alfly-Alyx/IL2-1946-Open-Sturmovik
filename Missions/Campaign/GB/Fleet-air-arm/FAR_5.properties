Name Kondor Raider
Short Shoot down and incoming FW200 Kondor bomber\n
Description You survived the last mission with a few superficial wounds despite how much flak hit your Hurricane. We recently recieved one of the new MkIIc Sea Hurricanes mounted with cannons. This should give you an edge against the well armed FW200. The Germans have been using the bad weather to their advantage. While the land based fighters are grounded, the long range FW200s are out on patrol looking for undefended convoys. Although the weather is a bit rough today, you will need to launch to intercept an incoming FW200. Again, set up your attacks carefully on this machine.\n
