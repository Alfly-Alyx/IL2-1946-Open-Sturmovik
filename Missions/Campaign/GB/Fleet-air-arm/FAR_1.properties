Name August 3 1941
Short Intercept FW200 Recon aircraft\n
Description Thank you for volunteering for this very dangerous assignment as a pilot of a Sea Hurricane. The convoys need air protection against the German bombers that have been sent to attack them. Desperate times require desperate measures. After recieving a few opportunities to train on the catapult launching of your aircraft, you are assigned to CAM (catapault aircraft merchantman)ship. Your flight is only one way. You will launch off the CAM and intercept enemy raiders and then either ditch your plane near the CAM or parachute into the water near the ship. Today, August 3 1941, we have recieved word that a FW200 Kondor is approaching the convoy. The aircraft is most likely on a recon mission. Down the FW200 to prevent it from radioing our position. As this aircraft is so large and well defended, you should make your attacks carefully. Many have had luck making head on attacks and trying to aim for the cockpit or engines.\nWe'll try to be prepared to pick you up when you return\n
