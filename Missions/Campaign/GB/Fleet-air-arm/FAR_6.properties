Name Attack on radar station
Short You will launch at dawn to attack a radar facility and coastal artillery.\n
Description This morning our convoy will have to pass through a narrow strait between two islands. On the northernmost island, the German navy has set up two radar stations to track shipping through the straits. They have also set up a costal artillery to cover both the eastern and western approaches. At dawn you will catapult and head towards the island from the East. Climb over the high ground and attack the radar while hugging the hills on your way down to the southwestern side of the island. If you still have ammunition left, try to take out any vehicles, artillery or other targets of opportunity. Today instead of ditching, bale out of your aircraft when you have arrived at your final waypoint near the convoy. We'll have a launch at the ready with a lifesaving crew. \n
