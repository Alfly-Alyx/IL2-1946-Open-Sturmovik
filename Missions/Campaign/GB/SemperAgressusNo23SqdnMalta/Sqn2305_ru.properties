Short Look for enemy supply columns in Tunisia.\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta, April 1943.\n\nTonight we'll once again make our Mosquitos live up to their names. This time we will fly to Tunisia and search for enemy columns attempting to bring supply to the Afrikakorps further East... and 'annoy' the hell out of them ! \nWhen we find them, we shall dive and bite to suck the precious blood from Rommel's veins. Only our planes don't bite, they spit 20mm canon shells, and Rommel probably needs more fuel than blood right now.\n\nWykeham-Barnes will take off first and sweep the Msaken area with Red Section, while I sweep South with White Section in the Bou Merdes area.\n\nTo make sure not one lorry makes it out alive, two planes will scout ahead of the formation and drop flares to mark the enemy vehicles they find. The columns thus marked will be easy targets, and burning fuel trucks should create all the light we need to see like in broad daylight.\n\nSpeaking of fuel, It will be a long flight to the target and back, and we've been warned to always keep an eye on our fuel gauge and promptly make for home if our tanks are hit.\n\nI guess both friends and foe will be doing their best not to bleed to death tonight...\n\nPlayer skin : $$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp\nmarkings off.\n
