Short Strike the enemy airfield at Pachino.\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta, April 1943.\n\nWhere have our manners gone ? \n\nWe've now been operating out of Malta and over Sicily for a few months, but we have yet to pay a visit to our neighbours at Pachino. Certainly not what the sizeable Italian garrison and German transport pilots must expect from British RAF gentlemen.\n\nWe are determined to make amends for this unforgiveable mistake no later than tonight.\n\nIn keeping with No.23 Squadron's traditions and in an effort not to fail our good reputation any longer, four of us will go on a raid to straffe the airfield for as long as our ammo and fuel levels permit. \n\nWe are all sincerely hoping this will let the Pachino Jerry know how deeply sorry we are for ignoring them for so long.\n\nPlayer skin :$$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp  markings off.\n
