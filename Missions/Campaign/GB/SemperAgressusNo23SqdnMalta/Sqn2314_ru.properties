Name 14
Short Carry out a nuisance raid on the enemy base at Pantelleria.\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta,  June 1943.\n\nThe last enemy forces in North Africa have finally capitulated and the continent is now, at long last, fully under Allied control. Commonwealth, American and Free French forces are now reassembling and getting ready for the next stage of the war in the Meditterranean : the invasion of Sicily, and then Italy herself.\n\n The Italian garrisons of Lampedusa and Pantelleria now find themselves in the same position Malta was in not even a year ago : outnumbered, facing a dtermined foe, cut off from supply lines and under siege. For the past few days, both islands have been under nearly constant attack from USAAF bombers and fighters, Allied naval units as well as our own Bomber Command chaps, in an effort to compell them to surrender.\n\nAs many of us learnt the hard way during the Blitz back in old Blighty, sleep deprivation goes a long way to undermining one's morale, and so our services are once again needed to ensure night doesn't bring much needed rest to the besieged Italians. \n\nI will lead a section of four to attack the enemy installations at Pantelleria with bombs and canons. Anything that moves or looks like it could still be mobile will be for us to engage.\n\nIf our timing is right, we should arrive on target just as a group of Bomber Command Liberators makes a high altitude bombing run on the docks, which should make for a nice fireworks show.\n\nPlayer skin :$$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp  markings off.\n
