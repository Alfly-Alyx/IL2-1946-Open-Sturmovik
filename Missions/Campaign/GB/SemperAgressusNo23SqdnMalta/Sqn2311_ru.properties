Short Carry out a large raid on Tunis\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta, May 1943.\n\nThe entire squadron is up in arms for tonight's mission. \n\nWykeham Barnes will lead us on a squadron-strength nuisance  mission to Tunis.  The Allied advance in the West and South has created a great concentration of enemy troops and equipment in the city, and though we have been given no clear objectives, targets of opportunity shouldn't be to hard to come by.\n\nAmong the areas of interest are a number of key installations :\n\n-The docks area in the South-East area of the city.\n\n-The railway station South of the city. Railway traffic has been seriously disturbed by day and night raids, destroying many locos on the tracks, but the   few survivors   should have found shelter in the Tunis railyard.\n\n- The El Aouina airbase in the North of the bay, one of the Axis' last major bases in Tunisia.  \n\n-The Carthage seaplane base in the North-East bay.\n\nWe will make full use of our new Mk.VI Mossies and take four 250 lbs bombs with us to do as much damage as we can to each of these targets.\n\nIn order to allow for better flexibility during the attack, we will fly in autnomous pairs instead of the usual sections of four. This way we will be able to engage more targets all at once. \nAs a result of this high concentration of high profile targets bunched up in such a small area, Flak is expected to be very heavy over the bay. \n\nFor these reasons, extreme caution will be in order over the target area, to avoid collision with  friendlies or  88mm Flak shells...\n\nFinally, so as to take the city's defences by surprise , we will attack from the North-East. This will substancially increase the flight time to target and we won't be able to maintain our presence over Tunis for too long. I must remember to keep an eye on my fuel gauge...\n\nPlayer skin : $$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp\nmarkings off.\n
