Short Attack the enemy airfield at Kairouan.\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta,  May 1943.\n\nTonight's mission will take us back over Tunisia. We will fly deeper inland to carry out a nuisance raid on the German base at Kairouan.\n\nKairouan is one of the German's most forward airfields and a base for their Fw-190 fighters in the area. The enemy also uses it to fly first necessity suppies to the troops trying to hold back the Yankees further West.\n\nParked planes are our main targets, as well as key infrastructures. Destroying a transport means air supply lines will be momentarily cut, but knocking down the control tower or putting craters in the runway could disable the outpost for a couple of days.\n\nAdditionally, Kairouan's position far from the enemy's main supply depots means they have to store larger quantities of fuel and ammunition. In the current situation, destroying the fuel and ammo dumps could put the airfield out of commission once and for all.  \n\nPlayer skin :$$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp  markings off.\n
