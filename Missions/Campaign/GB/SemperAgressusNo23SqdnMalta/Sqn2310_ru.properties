Short Strike the enemy airfield at Bu Ficha\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta,  May 1943.\n\nTarget for tonight is the enemy airfield at Bu Ficha. The Luftwaffe uses the small base as a stop for their night transport planes evacuating from their forward bases in Tunisia, so there should be plenty of targets to go around. \n\nThis also means the anti aircraft defenses will be fully operational, and will be expecting us. Flak should be pretty heavy over there.\n\nThe Yankees further West have reported nightfighter sightings these last few days. The Nachtjagd has been keeping a low profile so far, but might make a come back now with the dramatic increase in enemy night air traffic, requiring constant protection.... from us.\n\nPlayer skin :$$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp  markings off.\n
