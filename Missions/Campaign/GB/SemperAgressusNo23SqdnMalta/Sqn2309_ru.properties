Name 09
Short Hunt down a U-Boot attempting to reach Lampedusa.\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta, April 1943.\n\nToday at 1600, a transport headed to Alexandria was attacked by a German U-Boot between, Pantelleria and Lampedusa. A torpedo hit it right under the waterline causing massive damage to its hull and steam boilers. A Navy destroyer is rescuing the crew as we speak.\n\nThe U-Boot is thought to have been hit by depth charges from the escorts shortly after the attack and we believe it is trying to reach the nearest enemy harbour. A Sunderland has been trying to locate the wounded submarine all evening, with no luck so far.\n\nNight and bad weather are now forcing the Sunderland to give up the search, but darkness and some petty Meditterranen clouds aren't going to stop us.\n\nI gave orders for four planes to be loaded with bombs and will lead them on a sweep in the area of the Germans' estimated position. With luck, they won't be expecting Nightfighters to be after them, assume the night will hide them and surface the ship to reload their batteries. This will be their last mistake.\n\nA scout plane will be patrolling the area and will use flares to mark the target when they find it. We must be on the look out for these flares as they'll tell us where the enemy is. Once the U-boot is spotted, we will attack it with bombs and canons and show those FAA pilots how Mosquitoes can bite the head off Wolves...\n\nPlayer skin :$$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp  markings off.\n
