Name 06
Short Patrol the South-East railway line and straffe the railway station and marshalling yard at Siracuse.\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta, April 1943.\n\nTonight we are tasked with disrupting  the Italians' railroad activity in South-East Sicily. \n\nI wil ltake a four ship flight on a patrol along the main S-E railroad line. All manner of trains are expected to be traveling on the lines, from passenger trains to heavy equipment convoys. \n\nWe will head N-E along the tracks and look for trains to attack. Once over Siracuse, we will straffe the Marshalling yard and railway station. Any other target of interest may be engaged, but our main objective remains to cripple the Italians' railway infrastructures. \n\nI was hoping the weather would clear and the conditions would be better suited to this kind of operations, unfortunately the moon will still largely be obscured by coulds. We must be very careful out there.\n\nPlayer skin :$$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp  markings off.\n
