Name Semper Agressus : No. 23 Squadron in Malta.
Description Join No.23 Squadron and fly the Mosquito in 14 night intruder missions over Sicily and Tunisia in Spring 1943. \n In December 1942, No.23 Squadron, one of the RAF's pioneering night intruder squadrons, were re-deployed to Luqa, Malta, with their new Mosquito aircraft, becoming the first squadron to operate the type in the Mediterranean. While based on the island, No.23 Squadron continued to do what they had been doing best since 1940, carrying out nuisance raids and deep night intruder missions over Tunisia and Sicily. \n This campaign lets you join No. 23 Squadron in the last few months leading up to the Afrikakorps' surrender on the preparations for the invasion of Sicily. 
\n\nThis campaign was designed to be flown with 'full real' settings. Disable icons and minimap icons. Don't forget to turn off 'no instant success' or you'll be stuck in the first mission ! \n\nAltitudes and waypoints are given as a guideline, but you don't have to follow them strictly. The missions may just not play out the same if you stray too far away from them. \n\nGood luck and remember : Per Ardua Ad Astra !
