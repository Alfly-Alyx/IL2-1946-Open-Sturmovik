Name 03
Short Carry out a patrol over the enemy airfields in Sicily.\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta, March 1943.\n\nTonight we go hunting. Our two ship flight will carry out a patrol over the major Italian airfields in the South of Sicily. \nStarting S-E, we will fly over the airfields at Comiso, Caltagirone, Gela, and Licata, where we hope to take enemy transports and night bombers by surprise as they land. \nQuite a lot of enemy air traffic has been reported around these airfields in the last few days and we are almost guaranteed to find something to sink our teeth in.\n\nWe  shall fly at an altitude of 3300 ft and try to stay at a safe distance from the enemy airfields' anti aircraft guns. We may not engage targets on the ground and keep our ammunition for airborne planes.\n\nPlayer skin :$$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp  markings off.\n
