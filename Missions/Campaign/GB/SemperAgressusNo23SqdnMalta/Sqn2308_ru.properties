Short Search for retreating enemy convoys near Hergla.\n
Description No. 23 squadron, Luqa, Malta, April 1943.\n\nSolwly, but surely, Montgomery is driving the Arfika Korps out of Arica. What is left of the German expeditionary force is pulling back towards Tunis, with our tanks hard on their heels.\n\nAs a result, the hunting has been very good  along the main coastal roads and we are almost guaranteed to find enemies to straffe there evrey night.\n\nFollowing Monty's latest breakthrough in the South, Rommel has called back several units, and they have been transiting through our hunting area. A flight of Beaufoghters  obliterated a trooops convoy near Hergla earlier tonight, and we suspect more Germans will be taking advantage of the dark to go through the same area. \n\nI'll take a section to patrol the sector and try to catch the late Germans. The road will be lit by the burning wrecks from the previous raid, which should make it easier for us to spot movement on the ground.\n\nWe'll just need to be careful not to loiter there for too long to avoid German dawn fighter patrols.\n\nPlayer skin :$$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp  markings off.\n
