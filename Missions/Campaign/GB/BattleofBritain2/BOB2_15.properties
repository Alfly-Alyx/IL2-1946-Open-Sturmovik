Short \n
Description DATE: Friday, October 4, 1940.   11:00AM\n\nWEATHER: Yesterday's weather has continued today. Mist, rain, low ceiling and poor visibility throughout the day, fog expected after dark.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Biggin Hill.\n\nSITUATION: Wednesday, October 2,  Six major attacks into the Kenley / Biggin Hill area over the course of the day by approximately 300 Luftwaffe fighters, crossing in through the Dover & Beachy Head area. RAF success was very favorable throughout the day.\n\nThursday, October 3, There were no attacks by enemy formations, probably due to adverse weather conditions.  However, after mid-day, a fairly continuous succession of raids by single aircraft crossed the coast and in some cases dropped bombs in various parts of the country. Many of the places have no military importance.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF BIGGIN HILL : FLIGHT LINE - PATROL\n\nA light drizzle like a fine mist drifted across the Hill as you walked with Denny across the tarmac on the flightline.  Two C-47s playing follow the leader idled past on their way to the runway for takeoff. \n\nYou turned up the collar on your flight jacket as they passed, their prop wash swirling the drizzle.  "I can't believe those poor bastards are going up to jump on a miserable day like this..."\n\nDenny's hands were in his pockets, his cap low... "how d'ya know they're going up to jump...?"\n\nYou shrugged, "seems like that's all they ever do when they go up..."\n\n"What d'you think they're training for?" He asked, not looking up.\n\n"Your guess is as good as mine," you replied, wiping the drizzle from your face, "but I'd bet a weeks flight wages they're practicing to go in behind enemy lines for sabotage..."\n\n"Careful Skipper," chided Denny,  "that's how I got us a couple new Spits." \n\nYou laughed out loud, "bloody good point..."\n\n"What time's our patrol?" \n\nYou glanced at your watch, "thirty minutes, we're going up in pairs. Lads should be here any minute..." You handed Denny your clipboard with your notes as you walked. "Just simple patrols, we won't see much today, if anything they'll be in singles. All we have to do is follow our routes at best visible altitude."\n\nYour Squadron's two new Spits were sitting at the start of the row and as you got closer, their blemish-free, rain slicked paint looked like the showroom finish on a new auto. You couldn't help but grin like a street urchin in a confectionary store...\n\nDenny cleared his throat, "may I point something out..." he whispered,"... you're grinning like a ruddy mental patient..."\n\n"Sorry," you chuckled, reaching out for the wingtip as you walked up, "it's just so bloody marvelous... not a chip, not a scratch..." Doing a walk-around you continued, "...and wait until you sit inside her, nothing like the smell when they're brand new like this..."\n\nDenny chuckled and shook his head, "smell... hell I'll be happy to fly one that fires on all twelve cylinders and doesn't drop parts every time I take off..."\n\n"Well you got your wish," you replied, "because the other one's yours..."\n\n"Really...?"\n\n"Absolutely. We wouldn't have them if it wasn't for your expert wheeling and dealing... 'ahem', even if it was through more than a bit of illegal gambling..."\n\n"...which shall remain umentioned," added Denny.\n\nYou nodded, "...which shall remain unmentioned. And not to change the subject, but we might as well make you leader of the second flight. We're only doing pairs for patrol today, but a good way to get your feet wet." \n\n"I thought Blackfield was the leader for Second Flight..."\n\nYou nodded, climbing up on the wing of your new Spit, "he was, the Old Man, stole him away this morning... he went to 79. Johnny lost a couple Lads this week. One was his flight leader for Second Flight. The Old Man wanted to give him someone strong."\n\nDenny nodded thoughtfully, stroking the wing edge of his new Spitfire. "Well thanks Skipper, I'll try not to let you down..."\n\n"Don't worry, you won't." You slid open your cockpit and inhaled the new plane smell, "...aaahhh... wonderful."\n\nDenny laughed, "you're a bit daft you know..."\n\n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A_new" skin.**\n\n\n
