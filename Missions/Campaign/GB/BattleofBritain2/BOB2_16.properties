You hopped in and he put it in gear, pulling away, "where to Skipper?"\n\n"To the line Den, we're going up as soon as we can get off the ground..."\n\n"Right. Where are we headed?"\n\n"There's a flight coming in from the South East, looks like it's fighter-heavy by about two or three to one..."\n\nDenny let out a low whistle, "they're teasing us to come up and play..."\n\n"I'd say so", you nodded. They'll be overflying Hawkinge in about 10 minutes or so."\n\n"Who's out there today?"\n\n"RAF Control has 66 out of Gravesend listed as posted there for the day. They'll scramble after the flight passes..."\n\nDenny nodded, "stay under the nets to keep from getting spotted and bounced on takeoff..." He steered toward the flight line. "Good idea..."\n\nThe pilots of 72 were waiting around their planes, gear in hand, the ground crews scrambling around to get them ready. "It'll take some time for 66 to get to altitude and catch them... we'll probably intercept before they get to them."\n\n"Anybody else going?"\n\n"41 out of Hornchurch," you replied as he slowed the Jeep to a stop between your planes. "But they'll be behind us."\n\nDenny climbed out of the Jeep and took his gear handed to him by a ground crewman. "We'll I hope they don't bloody dawdle about..."\n\nYou laughed, "me too, or we'll be up there with our arses hanging out." You climbed into your parachute rig as the other pilots looked on. "Don't just stand there Lads," you announced, "saddle up!"\n\nDenny looked sideways at you and some of the pilots hesitated. "Saddle up...?  Did you say saddle up?!"  He shook his head, grinning. "I knew letting those Yanks have dinner  with us at the Boar & Thistle would lead to no good... "\n\n"I rather liked those Yanks," you replied, "and so did Johnny..."\n\n"Yeah, maybe a bit too much," he said a little more seriously.  "But what's not to like..." he continued a little sarcastically, climbing up on the wing of his Spitfire, " they're big, loud, forward, boastful, arrogant..."\n\nYou laughed as you climbed into your cockpit. Some of the Spifires around you were starting up, their Rolls Royce engines popping to life. "That's what I liked about them..!" you shouted, holding the starter button in.\n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A_new" skin.**\n\n\n
