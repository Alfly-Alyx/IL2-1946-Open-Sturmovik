Name Battle of Britain - Spit N Fire_23
Short \n
Description DATE: Thursday, October 31, 1940.   6:45PM\n\nWEATHER: Colder, mostly cloudy, light scattered percipitation throughout the day and night.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Lympne\n\nSITUATION: Monday, October 28, through Wednesday, October 30, colder wet weather and scattered fog made the past few days miserable for both pilots and ground crew. But equally, the weather provided relief from enemy raids which have been reduced to nuisance raids during the daytime and random observation flights. Nighttime raids have also been reduced. \n\nNight attacks have continued, but at reduced levels on London, Portsmouth, Nottingham and Sheffield.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF LYMPNE : FLIGHT LINE\n\nIt was surprising how a few days of lousy weather, no matter how miserable, could actually raise spirits... It probably had alot to do with getting a couple extra hours of much needed rest.  Another contributing factor was the growing number of outgoing flights of Lancaster and Wellington bombers. Just knowing the heavy boys were giving some of it back to the Jerrys, gave a bloke warm feelings all over.\n\nA light drizzle pattered on the roof of the tent and a blast of cold, damp air rushed in when Denny threw the flap aside and let himself in. "Damn, close that, you're letting the heat out," you complained.\n\n"Sorry Skipper." He pulled it back and taking his cap off, brushed the water off. "Crews are almost ready, got most everything packed up..."\n\n"Ok, I'm almost ready..." Just then you heard the unmistakable sound of a Merlin Rolls Royce turning over and sputtering to life. It sounded rough at first, then began to smooth out as it warmed up.\n\n"I told them to warm up the kites..." Denny said, pouring himself a cup of tea from the pot off the little pot-bellied stove.\n\nYou nodded,"good idea, they've been sitting awhile, and with all this soak, bound to be one or two that'll be stubborn..." You sat back, pushing back from the map table and looked up at Denny. In the low light of the lone gas lantern, the heavy shadows made him look older than his 24 years. Hell, you were only 29 but you were already getting grey hair. "How about our other 4 crates?"\n\nDenny blew the steam off his tea and sipped lightly. "Be another day or two... there's alot of work on a couple of them. In fact, 46 is getting a whole new engine."\n\nYou sipped your tea and made a face, realizing it was cold. "I think we have a couple more that need new engines..."\n\nDenny snorted, "psshh, I don't think engines are the issue, we need new planes..."\n\nYou smiled, "you working on anything...?"\n\nHe shook his head, "not this time Skipper... his Mum found out he was gambling and almost flattened his noggin with a skillet."\n\n"Yikes," you chuckled, folding your maps and packing your paperwork. "Well, I know how resourceful you can be... see what you can come up with..."\n\n"Will do..." \n\nAnother blast of cold wet weather marked the entrance of the Communications Sergeant from the radio truck. "Sorry Commander," he began, "temperatures dropping..." he mumbled, closing the flap. "Mother Goose called," he handed you his notes, "some Jerry flights harrassing a convoy West of Dover."\n\nYou looked over the coordinates and nodded, "thank you Sergeant. Dismissed." The Sergeant left as you gathered your gear. "Time to earn our keep Denny... we'll head back to the Hill after we've had a look-see."\n\nYou zipped your jacket and hiked your collar as you ran toward your idling planes and into the cold, wet blast of the prop wash. "Bullocks...!"\n\nDenny slowed and looked over his shoulder, "Forget something Skipper?"\n\n"Lauren's birthday is Sunday..." you reached your wingtip and paused, "bloody hell, I'm buggered..."\n\n"Take it easy Skipper, I'll talk to Bittering when we get back to the Hill..."\n\n"The little guy in Admin with the wire frame glasses...?"\n\n"Exactly," he said ,shrugging on his chute. "As a civilian, he's a jeweler..." he buckled his harness, "and he owes me..."\n\n"You mean..."\n\nDenny nodded with an ear-to-ear grin, "his Mum doesn't own a skillet..." \n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A" skin.**\n\n
