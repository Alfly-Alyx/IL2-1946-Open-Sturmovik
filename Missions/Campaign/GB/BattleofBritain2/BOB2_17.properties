Name Battle of Britain - Spit N Fire_17
Short \n
Description DATE: Friday, October 11, 1940.   4:00PM\n\nWEATHER: Mainly fair with variable cloud cover and light scattered showers in some coastal areas.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Hawkinge - Day Field\n\nSITUATION: Tuesday, October 8, through Thursday October 10. Variable but mostly cloudy weather throughout the week with scattered showers did not hamper aggressive enemy raids. Targets were varied and included airfields. Formations were generally smaller but with a larger number of fighter to bomber ratio. Some raids consisted of all fighters. \n\nIn an address to Commons this week, Churchill stated that British bombing casualties are decreasing. The RAF attacked Berlin this week.\n\nAggressive night raids continue on London regardless of the weather.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF HAWKINGE : FLIGHT LINE - INTERCEPT\n\nA sandwich, a drink and a comfortable chair is all you wanted, it had been a long day and a hard week. The ground crews were busy re-arming and re-fueling your Spitfires. Hawkinge was not one of your favorite fields... rough, scarred, and little in the way of comforts - because it was for daytime use only. You munched on your sandwich and closed your eyes for a moment, trying to put aside the fact that there was little in the way of air defenses here... it was a vulnerable feeling.\n\nDenny strolled up under the netting, a sandwich and drink in hand, "ahhh a bit of shade..." he dropped into the chair next to you, "good Lord I'm exhausted... how long can Jerry keep this up...?"\n\nYou knew it was a retorical question and you continued to eat quietly, your eyes still closed. Several of your other pilots sat in the grass nearby, streching out in the shade of the trees, relaxing, eating, drinking, most of them silently.\n\nThe Radio truck sat nearby and you could hear the ambient radio chatter - it was the only detracting factor to this otherwise quiet moment.\n\n"How many do we have left?" You asked not opening your eyes.\n\nDenny swallowed and cleared his throat, "two full flights... everybody made it down in one piece, but I think two of the kites are a writeoff."\n\nYou sighed, "anybody hurt?"\n\n"Nothing serious, a few cuts and bruises...  Alfie put down at the Seven Oaks Spit Factory with a rather nasty coolant leak... so they'll probably send him off tomorrow once they get his crate put back together."\n\n"Ok..."\n\n"The others," he continued, "made it to the Hill but one had to belly-in, his carriage wouldn't come down..."\n\n"Blast..." you muttered.\n\n"Sir...?" Your eyes popped open and it took you a second to focus as 'Sparks' the radio Sergeant stepped down from the back of the radio truck with a paper in his hand. "A message from Lympne..." You sat forward as he walked over to hand you the message. "Don't know why they're sending it over here to you though... it says a Johnathon Trumbul from 79 went down over the Channel. "\n\nYou grinned, "It's Ok Sergerant, we're close friends...  So, Jumpin Johnny took another swim today, eh?" You took the message and began to read it. You sat back. "Bloody Hell, I need a drink..."\n\nDenny offered his cup, "here Skipper...  what did he say...?" \n\nYou made no move to take the tea handed you. "It's from Blackfield, his Second. Johnny's crate went down over the channel, no one saw a chute... it went straight in..."\n\n"Damn..." Denny breathed, leaning forward, "...there were alot of clouds over the Channel, maybe he opened low..."\n\nYou stood up slowly, "I need a drink... a real drink..."\n\nSparks reappeared from the back of the radio truck. Sir..." In his extended hand was a little silver flask. "It's good stuff..."  he said reassuringly. Without speaking you accepted it and took a hefty swig, then handed it to Denny who took a swig. He handed it back to the Sergeant. The Sergeant snapped to attention, "to the lost - and a permanent set of wings..." he took a swig, saluted and turned, going back into the radio truck.\n\n"Boy that was good stuff," wheezed Denny.\n\n"Damn smooth," you breathed. \n\n30 minutes later at about 4:00PM an inbound raid was sighted and 72 got the call for intercept, you would meet converging flights in grid T-11 at about Angels 9, before turning back towards Dover to meet the incoming raid. It was back to business.\n\nSitting on the runway, engines running, you checked by radio to be sure everyone was ready...  everyone confirmed, ready to go. With your canopy still open, you throttled up and began to roll... Out of the corner of your eye, you could see a Jeep screaming across the apron. It slid to a stop in a cloud of dust next to your wingtip and you dropped the throttle to an idle, tapping your toe brakes, your Spitfire lurching to a stop.\n\nDust swirling about and Sparks stood up on the drivers seat of the Jeep and cupped his hands around his mouth, "he's been picked up! He's still alive...!" \n\nYou nodded vigorously, grinned and waved... \n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A_new" skin.**\n\n\n
