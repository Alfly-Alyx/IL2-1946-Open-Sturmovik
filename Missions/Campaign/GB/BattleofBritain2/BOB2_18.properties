Description DATE: Tuesday, October 15, 1940.   11:30AM\n\nWEATHER: Mainly fair with light clouds.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Biggin Hill\n\nSITUATION:  Saturday, October 12,  Raids were smaller but more numerous. Even though it was foggy much of the day, seven seperate raids created an exhaustive day of constant action, penetrating to Biggin Hill, Hornchurch and London.  Sunday, October 13, Early fog with four main attacks. Flights were smaller in strength. Fighters remain 75% of the raiding aircraft.  Monday, October 14, Rain and drizzle seemed to match the curtailed action, few enemy aircraft were noted.\n\nAggressive night raids continue on London and surrounding areas, regardless of the weather, lasting till shortly before dawn.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF BIGGIN HILL : FLIGHT LINE - INTERCEPT\n\nThe man everyone fondly called "Jumpin Johnny" was lucky to be alive. He'd cheated the Grim Reaper, and the Jerrys, yet again... but just barely. Truthfully, he was a mess... he was barely breathing when the rescue boat plucked him out of the Channel. They transferred him over to a flying boat which took him to their base at Dover, then by ambulance to Lympne, then by transport plane back to the Hill, with the best hospital around. It was a painful three hour ordeal.\n\nAs far as it could be determined from observers and Johnny's own sketchy memory, 79 was badly outnumbered, their supporting flight arriving late to the interception point.  His kite badly shot up and wounded, Johnny had gotten trapped in his cockpit, the canopy jammed, the windshield perspex covered in oil and smoke filling the cockpit as he struggled to get out. His Hurricane was spiraling in. Using his Webley revolver, he shot the latches off the canopy and freed it, then fighting his way out of his crippled kite with barely enough altitude left for his chute to open, he managed to climb out. He struck the tail of his spinning Hurricane and broke both legs. He still managed to open his chute though he didn't recall doing it. "I'd done it so many times, I guess it was just automatic..." he'd joked. Johnny hit the water so hard, he'd broken several ribs, dislocated his shoulder and collapsed one lung... but still managed to inflate his life vest.\n\nHe was awake when you visited, a cute little nurse sitting at his bedside chatting with him. The poor sod  was black & blue from head to toe. "No jokes please," he smiled crookedly, "it hurts too much to laugh..." \n\nYou had to admire the fact that he still hadn't lost his sense of humor. "Ok, no jokes... promise." The nurse excused herself with a smile and got up and left the two of you alone. "Good Lord, you look like you had a fight with the Devil... you look like Hell."\n\n"Thanks, I feel like it too," he replied. "Say, aren't you supposed to be here to cheer me up...?\n\n"Sorry." You looked at his bandaged and bruised body in amazement, "four bailouts and you're still here..."\n\n"Five now," he corrected, lifting his good arm.\n\n"Five..? Hmm, I wonder... that's got to be some kind of a record.  All I can say is, you must have one Hell of a Guardian Angel..."\n\n"Heh, could be, but he must've been out having bloody tea and biscuits when that Jerry buggered me..." He shifted uncomfortably, stuffing the pillow under his head with his good arm - you were stuck trying to decide whether he needed your help or not. "Ahh, there, that's better...  Right, so, who's got my squadron then?"\n\n"Blackfield..."\n\nJohnny nodded a little, "Right, he'll do ok... just tell 'em not to get too comfortable... I'll want my squadron back as soon as I'm mended."\n\nYou grinned, "I'll do that. Look, get some rest, I'll pop in later tonight..."\n\n"I'll be right here," he replied cheerfully. It was obvious he was getting tired - or maybe the drugs were putting him to sleep. "Listen," he half whispered, "see if you can sneak me in a pint, I'm feeling a bit parched... and send that little nurse back," he yawned.\n\n"Will do," you said quietly, as he nodded off.\n \n          ------------------------------------\n\nTheir kites prepped and ready to fly, the Lads lounged around the flightline, their gear in their laps, hanging on their chairs, or close at hand. Some were chatting, sipping tea, others sat quietly, eyes closed restfully... and then there was the odd one or two, with that long, far-off stare, their eyes glazed in exhaustion. These young men were looking rather weary, aged beyond their years, and it made you feel old as well... your body felt heavy. 'How long can we keep this up?' You wondered. \n\nHaving already repaired the taxiway, bulldozers clanked around the infield, filling in the bomb craters from a previous raid...  and a crane chugged away as a construction crew rebuilt a service hanger along the flightline.\n\nA flight of Hurricanes passed low overhead, heading out to the coast, probably to Lympne for the day as you climbed wearily out of your jeep. You looked up and watched them pass. There was a table of sandwiches and tea in front of the tent on the grass along the flightline.\n\n"Skipper..."\n\n"Denny..." You accepted the cup of tea he offered you.\n\n"Those commandos sure packed up in a hurry..."\n\nHe was fishing and you knew it. " I noticed... wonder what they're up to," you said off-handedly. I haven't heard a peep."\n\nDenny nodded. "So, did you go see Johnny?" \n\nYou sipped before answering, "yep, they're letting people see him now."\n\nDenny nodded, "I'll go see him tonight, then. How's he doing?" He dropped into a chair and leaned forward as you sat in the one across from him.\n\n"He's in good spirits... or it could be the drugs," you smirked. "But I talked to the doctor, he doesn't think Johnny will be flying again..."\n\nDenny raised his eyebrows, "ever? Poor bastard..."\n\nYou shook your head, " his legs are pretty bad, even after he's mended, he'll probably need a cane to walk for the rest of his life. The doctor doesn't think he'll have the physical ability anymore... "\n\n"But...?"\n\n"...but at least he's alive," you finished, leaning back and stretching.\n\nDenny rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "I don't know if I could live like that... to not ever fly. I don't think I'd rather be dead, but I can't imagine not flying..." He stared into his cup.\n\n"Me neither..." You stared at the light clouds drifting across the sky. The light breeze made you shiver and you adjusted your jacket. "Looks like Autumn's here..."\n\nDenny didn't look up. "Yeah..." both of you were lost in your thoughts.\n\nThe radio operator jumped down from the radio truck parked under the camo net behind the tent and trotted over, handing you a slip of paper with coordinates on it. "Radar has two seperate raids coming in Sir - both at about Angels 6. All fighters. Looks like they'll merge near the top edge of grid U-14. Control estimates they'll come up the river to London from there..."\n\nStanding, you slung your gear over your shoulder and took the paper, "Lads..!"\n\nThe radio operator continued, "since your short on crates, Control has assigned you a flight from 610, they'll meet you on the tarmac. If you take your Lads up to Angels 7, you'll have a decent advantage." \n\n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A" skin.**\n**Release Chocks for takeoff**\n\n\n
