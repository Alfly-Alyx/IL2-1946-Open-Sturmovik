Name Battle of Britain - Spit N Fire_22
Short \n
Description DATE: Monday, October 28, 1940.   4:45PM\n\nWEATHER: Mostly cloudy, no rain expected.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Biggin Hill\n\nSITUATION: Friday, October 25, through Sunday, October 27, grey skies and scattered fog made most intercept missions an exhausting game of hide and seek. Enemy day attacks are frequent but have resorted to fighter - bomber runs with larger flights splitting up into smaller elements to strike multiple targets. While causing problems for RAF intercepts, the attacks have become generally, less effective. \n\nEnemy attacks have also increased on channel shipping but RAF control has had too few resources to spare for more assertive protection.\n\nNight attacks continue on London, the Midlands, Manchester and Liverpool.\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF BIGGIN HILL : FLIGHT LINE\n\nIt was the first time all day that you had gotten a chance to strech your legs... as you climbed out of your cockpit, you lay on you back across the wing of your Spitfire, staring at the sky. Your knees and elbows ached. \n\nDenny walked up to the edge of your wing, "you ok Skipper...?"\n\n"Arrghh," you groaned, streching, "my bloody knees are killing me..."\n\n"You getting too old for this, Skipper?" He joked.\n\n"Don't be a prat," you countered, "I saw you wobble over here."\n\n"Oh, you noticed..."\n\n"Uh-huh..."\n\nDenny laughed, "good God, I feel like my legs are going to fall off at the knees..."\n\nYou sat up, "let's go get a bite to eat while they work on our kites..."\n\nDenny nodded, "sounds good to me, but I need to head to the loo first, I feel like I'm about to burst..."\n\nThe best thing you could say about lunch was that it was hot... if someone had asked you to describe it, you would be at a loss for words. At least it was filling. The mess hall was empty except for the Lads in your Squadron.\n\nYou stared into your tea. "Have you visited Johnny?"\n\nDenny nodded, sipping his tea, "mmm, yes, Saturday evening... he's looking pretty good..."\n\n"He still with the little redhead?"\n\nDenny grinned, "the nurse? Yeah, lucky bastard... Is she not the most beautiful thing you've ever seen..? Er, well, uh, except for Lauren of course..."\n\nYou nodded, "nice recovery, Den."\n\n"Thanks..." You both stood, tea in hand and headed for the mess hall exit. "He's talking about putting a ring on her finger..." \n\nThat stopped you in mid stride, "you're kidding..." you looked sideways at Denny.\n\n"Hand to God," he said, raising his hand, "no kidding."\n\nYou shook your head and continued walking, "Johnny wants to get married... Wow..." As you swung the door wide, a blast of cold air from the open tarmac hit you, "bloody hell..."\n\nA Flight Sergeant came running up, "There you are Commander, been looking for you..."\n\n"Just getting a strech and a bite Sergeant..."\n\n"RAF Control needs your Lads up, Sir," he continued, "you're hitting enemy raids on their way home..."\n\n"Ok," you replied calmly, "where and when."\n\n"If you look up in about ten minutes you'll see them!" He replied, running off.\n\n"Bullocks!" You stuck you head back through the mess hall doorway, "everybody up Lads! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! \n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A" skin.**\n***Release Chocks for takeoff***\n\n\n
