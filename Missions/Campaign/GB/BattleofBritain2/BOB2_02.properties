Above the clouds, you looked out over your wing to watch them drifting slowly beneath you. For a moment, you found yourself thinking of Lauren. \n\nIt was the end of the day, time to leave Lympne and head back to the 'Hill'... this daily event left the satellite base literally abandoned. Sometimes the base needed work in the morning after the Jerries worked it over during their evening operations.\n\nYou looked out over the formation of Hurricanes around you, the young lads were doing well, flying smartly. It had been a busy day and 79 had flown well... they were starting to work as a team and the results showed.\n\n"Mother Goose to Fox Leader, Mother Goose to Fox Leader..."\n\nYou keyed your mic, "Fox Leader here, go ahead Mother Goose..."\n\n"Fox Leader, what's your location and altitude?"\n\nGlancing down at your map you replied, "grid S-8, headed North, angels 6."\n\n"Understood Fox Leader. We have a dispersing hostile flight, aproximately 20+ that has dropped to the deck and we have lost contact. Continue on current heading untill you enter grid S-11, turn ENE toward the Spitfire assembly plant North of Manston... maintain your altitude for best visibility. Locate and intercept."\n\n"Understood Mother Goose," you replied as you penciled notes on your map.\n\n"Good hunting Fox Leader..."\n\nReaching for your radio, you switched to a squadron station and instructed the transport planes when to break off and head to the 'Hill'.\n\n"Right Lads, our day's not over yet, tighten up, look sharp..."\n\n**Use "BigginHill79_D" skin.**\n
