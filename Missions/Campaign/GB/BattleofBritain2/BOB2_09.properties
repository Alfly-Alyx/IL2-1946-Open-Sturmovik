Short \n
Description DATE: Friday, September 20, 1940.   10:30AM\n\nWEATHER:Bright with light clouds, some localized rain can be expected\n\nLOCATION: RAF Biggin Hill.\n\nSITUATION: Wednesday, September 18, A continuation of the new Luftwaffe tactic of engaging RAF fighters directly in large numbers. Thursday, September 19, Reduced air activity due to weather conditions, with a number of single-plane reconaissance flights, many were intercepted. Oddly, a Ju88 force landed complete with bombs and crew undamaged at Oaklington. Night saw attacks on London and Merseyside.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF BIGGIN HILL: FLIGHT LINE \n\nThe pilots of 72 stood around their Spitfires eating sandwiches and sipping tea as the ground crews refueled them. It was a short respite between patrols, a chance to stretch their legs and chat... enjoying the first day in about a week without rain. \n\nMost of the talk today seemed to revolve around the OSS Commandos and their recent activities. At least it gave the Lads something new to talk about.\n\nMost of 610s Spitfires had landed and they were taxiing in to refuel. One rolled by, his canopy open, the Rolls Royce Merlin popping at idle... the brakes squeeked as he bought it to a gentle stop and shut it down. The engine shuddered and the prop whirred lazily to a stop. \n\nYou walked over to the wingtip... "See anything?" you called.\n\n"No sir..." replied the Flight Sergeant, standing up in the cockpit. "But it looks like something's brewing..." he swung his leg lazily over the side to step down to the wing. "We were too low on petrol to stick around though."\n\nYou looked over your shoulder, "Denny! Get the Lads in their kites!"\n\nFlight Sergeant Denny Pembrook had quicky become your right hand... and though Johnny's absence had left quite a gap, Denny Pembrook was filling it quite well.\n\nAs 72 taxied out to the runway, RAF Control confirmed what the Flight Sergeant from 610 Squadron had said... a large formation coming across the Channel at Angels 3, due to make land near Dover. \n\n"Understood Mother Goose," you replied, 72 is lifting off to intercept..."\n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A" skin.**\n\n\n
