"Is that a steak?"  \n\nJohnny nodded, chewing cheerily, grinning. A doll of a nurse with wavy red hair was sitting at his bedside. \n\n"You must be doing better then..." you said, grabbing a chair on the other side of his bed.\n\nJohnny waggled both of his elbows like a duck, "yep, got the other one working again... and I can breathe again," he said, inhaling deeply, tapping his fork to his chest. Hurts like the devil, but it's getting better."\n\nThe nurse rose  with a wink and a wave to Johnny, saying, "I'll let you gents catch up, I'll come back later and check in on you..." She blew him a kiss and sauntered off gracefully.\n\nYou leaned closer to Johnny, "is that a new one...?"\n\nHe smiled like a Cheshire cat, "I love this bloody hotel, I get the best service..."\n\n"Hmm, a redhead, huh? You know what they say about readheads, don't you...?"\n\nHe nodded, cutting his steak, "I know, but she's a real angel, Skipper... a real angel." \n\n"You mean she could be the ONE, Johnny...?" You asked, half kidding.\n\nHe popped a piece of steak into his mouth and grinned wickedly, "you see anybody else eatin' steak here Skipper..?" He gently tapped his fork on the tall glass standing on his tray, and lowered his voice, "and this ain't tea mate..."\n\n"Nooo..." you raised one eyebrow, "she didn't..."\n\n"Sure did. She went down to the Boar and Thistle, and brought me a steak and a Burton..."\n\n"Marvelous! She sounds like a keeper... Does she know what a rotten blighter you are..?" you kidded.\n\nJohnny smirked crookedly, "I think so..." he sipped his Burton "...so how's the Mrs?"\n\n"Her flat got hit earlier this week..."\n\nJohnny shot you a glance to study your face. "Really?! She ok?"\n\n"She's fine, she was doing an overnighter here..."\n\n"Good thing. How bad was it?"\n\nYou sighed, "leveled the whole block, there's nothing left..."\n\n"Agh, bloody Hell... pity. Sorry to hear it. Glad she's safe though." His expression changed, "Jerry bastards... I can't wait to get back up there." He shifted to get comfortable. "I hear there's a new Hurricane coming out with more power...?" \n\n"Right. Improved engine, sounds like you know about as much as I do..."\n\n"When are we getting them?"\n\n"I heard rumors of November, but I havn't heard anything official..."\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nLunch with Johnny played through your mind as you scanned the sky around you. You weren't sure if Johnny's determination to minimize his injuries was a positive frame of mind or a denial of the truth. \n\nOften, unreasonable expectations bordered on delusional and were detrimental to recovery... but then again, a positive mindset was often beneficial, leading to uncanny recovery results. His enthusiasm was contagious and you found yourself hoping he'd get a chance to fly one of those new Hurricanes.\n\nThe radio crackling in your headset got your immediate attention.\n\n"Mother Goose to Blue Swift Leader, Mother Goose to Blue Swift Leader..."\n\nYou keyed you mic, "this is Blue Swift Leader, go ahead Mother Goose..."\n\n"What is your petrol status and location, Blue Swift Leader?"\n\nYou took a quick glance at your gauges, "we have about forty percent petrol remaning, Mother Goose. Grid R-12-c, heading 345 degrees, Angels 6."\n\n"Very good Blue Swift Leader, stand by for instructions..."  there was a moment of hiss in your headphones before the controller continued, "...Blue Swift Leader please come to a heading of 60 degrees. Climb to Angels 8 for intercept... Spotters are tracking a flight of 30+ raiders, single and double engine."\n\n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A" skin.**\n\n\n\n
