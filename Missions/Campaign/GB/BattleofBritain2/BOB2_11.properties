"Hey Johnny," you placed your tea on the map table and stepped over to meet him, "I counted eight..."\n\n"Hiya Skipper..." Johnny nodded as he hopped out of the Jeep, "yep, all the Lads back, not a scratch." \n\n"Tea...?"\n\n"Sounds marvelous, I'm parched..."\n\n"Catch anything...?" You asked, pouring some tea in a cup.\n\nYou sat around the map table and Johnny sipped his tea, "...a couple. Chased a few reconaissance flights... they're using those blasted 110s for recon and they're so damned fast..." He shook his head,  "we caught one napping, but the other we came across simply outran us. Bloody frustrating..." He sipped again, "heard we're coming out with a new Cane, got a new powerplant with better speed and more guns... hope I live long enough to get one of those!" He grinned.\n\n"You? You're bloody bulletproof..." you chided.\n\nHe snorted, "maybe... but my kites don't seem to be!" \n\nYou laughed. "Yeah... you've jumped a couple times now, haven't you?"\n\n"Three times," he corrected, "they're startin' to call me 'Jumpin' Johnny'..."\n\nThat made you laugh out loud.\n\n"So how's the Mrs?" He asked, changing the topic.\n\n"Good..." you smiled. "Lauren caught a transport flight into the Hill a few nights ago and we had time to go into town and have dinner." You stared into your tea... "we were able to spend the whole night together. It was marvelous to forget this whole bloody mess for a few hours".\n\n"She go back already?"\n\nYou nodded, "next morning. But she's been trying to get transferred over to RAF Central Control..."\n\n"They're in that bunker building east of the Hill, right?"\n\nYou nodded, "that's right, we'd be closer and be able to see each other a little more..."\n\n"But..." Johnny questioned.\n\n"But," you continued, "with all the additional action in our sector, I'm worried about her safety, naturally."\n\n"Naturally..."\n\n"Commander...?" The Corporal was standing in the side doorway of the communications truck.\n\n"Yes Corporal?"\n\n"You flight's up... Control says in grid N-6,  we've got a convoy being shadowed by a Jerry recon plane... they're getting concerned, he's been with them for quite awhile."\n\nYou stood up. "Right. That's it then." You shook Johnnys hand, "take care Lad." You looked up at the Corporal, "tell Control we'll be in the air in less than 5 minutes."\n\n"Lets go Lads!"\n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A" skin.**\n\n\n
