This news, whether true or not, has bolstered British determination and morale.

Saturday, September 21, Enemy reconnaissance activity was increased but actual raids were at a reduced level.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF BIGGIN HILL: FLIGHT LINE HANGAR\n\nSeveral of 72s Spitfires were in the maintenance area for much needed work... Several more that were on the flight line were waiting their turn. It was impossible to ground every kite at once that needed work... some things just had to wait.\n\nA group of pilots sat around on chairs outside one of the larger hangars across from the flight line - relaxing, chatting and enjoying the evening air... that is, until you came roaring across the tarmac in your Jeep and screeched to a stop in front of the hangar. "Sergeant Pembrooke...!"\n\nDenny was already on his feet, he saluted. "Sir...?"\n\nYou set the brake and hopped out of the jeep, "how many kites do we have?"\n\n"Right now sir?"\n\n"Right now." \n\n"Er, six are fit... plus two or three more that are very overdue..."\n\n"Blast, we need at least eight..." you countered, pacing in front of the Jeep's headlights. The pilots of 72 gathered around, listening intently.\n\nA Flight Sergeant from 610 Squadron stepped forward, "no disrespect sir, but you're not planning to go up now, are you...?"\n\n"We've got Jerry bombers coming in for London at Angels 2..." you glanced at your watch, "... a little earlier than usual and we still have some light up there. The old man gave me approval to go up and give them a little surprise."\n\n"We'll fill you in sir," offered the Sergeant from 610. \n\nYou didn't hesitate, "bloody marvelous Sergeant! Lets go then Lads, Jerry's waiting on us!"\n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A" skin.**\n\n\n
