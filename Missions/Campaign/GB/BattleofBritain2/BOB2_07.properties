Name Battle of Britain - Spit N Fire_07
Short \n
Description DATE: Tuesday, September 17, 1940.   11:30AM\n\nWEATHER: Cloudy with rain. Squall lines creating localized thunder storms sweeping most areas of the the country.\n\nLOCATION: RAF Biggin Hill.\n\nSITUATION: Sunday, September 15, Better prepared after the Luftwaffe's massive raid on London on September 7th, the RAF employs a new tactic nicknamed 'The Big Wing', joining scores of RAF squadrons en-route to meet incoming raids.  Confident from their previous success, over 400 Luftwaffe planes crossed the channel headed for London - and were met head-on by over 160 RAF fighters - everything Sector 11 had available - no aircraft were left in reserve. The RAF claimed 185 enemy aircraft downed in that action, the largest German aircraft losses of the campaign, to date. Monday, September 16, Reduced air activity due to weather conditions - scattered reconaissance flights intercepted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nRAF BIGGIN HILL: ON PATROL\n\nTwo days of rain have left Lympne and Hawkinge rather waterlogged. When you talked to Johnny earlier in the day, his Hurricanes had been forced to land at the bomber factory at Maidstone to refuel after their morning patrol. The factory has a hard surface runway to support the larger planes and he didn't want to chance Lympne's condition. Once the thunderstorms swept through, all flights were grounded and his group had to stay until the weather passed.\n\nYour flight was the first in the area to get off the ground after the weather let up. You would be joined by 41 out of Hornchurch to investigate something radar reported over the Channel, with a heading to bring it ashore midway between Westampnett and Dover. Weather conditions prevented radar from deseminating any details.\n\nThe clouds were breaking, and as your flight rose through them, you could see blue above. \n\nYou keyed your mic, "Right Lads, up we go... Stick close, don't get lost, don't dally... We're going upstairs to get above this muck to about Angels 8..." \n\n**Use "BigginHill72_A" skin.**\n\n\n
