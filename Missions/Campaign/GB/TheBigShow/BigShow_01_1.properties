Short Thursday 11th November 1942 No.6 O.T.U. Rednal\nIt had snowed all night and the countryside was dazzling white.\nAfter a along train trip from London we are looking forward to our first flight in a Spitfire.\n
Description We have arrived at our Operational Training Unit in Wales (Rednal N0.61 O.T.U.) - after a long train journey.\nHere we flew the Spitfire Mk Vb for the first time, then accumulated our flying hours in training.\nWe flew formation exercises in three's, four's, twelves, emergency take-off's, dog-fight practice, air firing, tactic's course, navigation, aircraft recognition, speaking on the R.T. etc.\n\nDate: Saturday 13th November 1942\nTime: 10:00\nWeather: Good\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\n\nLast week you flew your Spitfire Vb for the first time. Your general flying is good, though you 'botched up' your landings several times - some more practice is required. \n\nToday you will carry out some cross country navigation training. Your flight will take you approximately 60 miles to the Gunnery practice range at Bangor aerodrome where you will join up with the rest of the Squadron.\n\nYou will take-off, heading due East until an altitude of 3,000 feet has been reached.\nNext, head towards Wrexham in the South West climbing to 10,000 feet and then West to Colwyn continuing onto Bangor. Be careful of the Welsh Mountains on your left, don't stray over them and watch out for other aircraft. On arriving at Bangor report to the station commander and phone me to confirm your arrival time. Study your map carefully and plan for alternative landing points if the weather closes in. Check that your oxygen supply is ok.\n\nRemember your cockpit drill BTFCPPUR - Brakes, Trim, Flaps, Contacts, Pressure, Petrol, Undercarriage and Radiator. After the heavy snow falls in the last few days, the runways will be 'iced up' - be careful using your brakes.\n\nHave a good flight and make your landing at Bangor a good one - I will be getting a report.\n\nChief Instructor\n\n
