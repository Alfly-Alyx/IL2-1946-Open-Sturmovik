Short First night in France\n
Description The 'Met' has forcasted fog over the south coast of England tomorrow morning which would immobilize our fighters. Weather over France should be clear allowing the Luftwaffe to attack the beachhead.\nTo counter this situation, 6 squadrons of fighters will take-off this evening and land as best they can on the half finished emergency airfields. You have been allocated B8 at Bazenville which sometimes comes under artillery bombardment.\nAccompany a B25 bombing raid on Saint-Romain airfield, diverting to B8.\n\nDate: 11 Jun 1944\nTime: 1945\nWeather: Poor\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet (1,500m)\nApproximate distance to target: 90 miles\n\nLuftwaffe order of battle: Ju88's and Do217's based at Saint - Paul are bombing the beachhead each night between 2000 and 0300\n\nMission notes:\nPierre Clostermann and his fellow French pilot and good friend 'Jacques' were given the honour of being the first French pilots to land in France after D Day. They both survived a sleepless night, being continually bombed by Ju88's and Do217's stooging around the beachhead, then 'clustering around like moths', whenever there was a major fire. To the south-east they could see the glow of Caen burning, while 40mm bofor shell fragments fell around them as 'thick as hail'.\n\nSpecial event: At the end of the mission,  watch a Mosquito night fighter take on the returning JU88's over Saint - Paul airfield\n
