Short Tempest v. Messerschmitts\n
Description G.C.C. has decided that only formations of eight aircraft will operate deep into enemy territory with another formation following on a parallel course, less than 60 miles apart, to go to each other's assistance.\n\nDate: 2nd Mar 1945\nTime: 14:50\nWeather: Poor\nCloud Height: 4,600 feet (1400m)\nApproximate distance to patrol area: 100 miles\n\nTalbot sections will patrol the German airfields at Hanover and Langenhagen, then move onto Wunsdorf airfield, near Bremen, looking for German fighter reaction.\n\nLuftwaffe order of battle: 30+ Long nose Focke Wulfs are based at Hanover, 60+ Focke Wulfs and 30+ Messerschmitts at Langenhagen and 100+ Messerschmitt Bf109K's at Wunsdorf.\n\nMission notes: Pierre Clostermann led both Talbot sections on this mission. After sweeping past Hanover and Langenhagen with no fighter reaction, he moved onto Bremen, within sight of the German night fighter base at Hoya. \nAs he gave the command to return, both Talbot sections were 'bounced' by 40-50 Wunsdorf Messerschmitts.\nClostermann quickly 'summoned up' 486 Squadron's help, being hopelessly out numbered. As the dogfight developed, he reminded his pilots to keep their airspeed over 300mph as the 109's could turn better at lower speed. \nClosterman shot down 2 Messerschmitts, damaging another. His wingman, Campbell, shot down another. 3 Tempests were lost from his eight aircraft Talbot formation. When 486 Sqn arrived the Wunsdorf Messerschmitt's disengaged.\n\n
