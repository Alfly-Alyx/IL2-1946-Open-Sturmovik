Description Novembert 30th 1942 Advanced Gunnery Training.\nYou're skill in piloting the Spitfire, is becoming apparent.\nToday you'll attempt to prove your marksmanship is getting sharper.\nAfter take-off head out into the channel in pursuit of the G-11 being towed by a Dakota transporter.\nThe glider will serve as your target for today.\nTo be honest, due to the lack of flammables on board, we don't expect many of you to succeed in actually destroying the target.\nThe main aim is to score some convincing hits, preferrably at the wing roots or control surfaces.\nIf anyone does manage to destroy the G-11 though, there will be a drink in it.\n\nPlease don't get too over zealous out there and cause damage to the Dakota.\nAnyone who does will face a Court Martial!\n
