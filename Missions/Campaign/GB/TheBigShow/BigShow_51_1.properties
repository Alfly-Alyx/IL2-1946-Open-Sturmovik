Short Into the Inferno of Flak\n
Description Pierre Clostermann could feel the Wing was on its last lap - he was placed in temporary command of the Wing.\nThe Luftwaffe was evacuating to the Danish islands and further to Norway with the Allies relentlessly advancing on them.\nAir Chief Marshall Harry Broadhurst wanted the Tempest Wing to spearhead the chase. The Wing was now based at the former German airfield at Fassberg.\n\nDuring the last three days, local thunderstorms over the peninsular of Denmark had made it difficult for the Allies to chase the Luftwaffe.\nG.C.C. (Group Central Control) decided to mount a mission - a reconnaissance Spitfire had brought back photographs taken over the Grossenbrode air-naval base showing over 100 large transport flying boats being loaded - There would probably be strong enemy fighter cover, protecting this evacuation.\n\nDate: 29th Apr 1945\nTime: 12:05\nWeather: Thunder\nCloud Height: 4,600 feet (1400m)\nApproximate distance to target: 120 miles\n\nMission notes: 24 Tempests took off into thunder storm skies. They flew around Hamburg, then over Neumunster at 10,000 feet. The weather began to deteriorate badly. Scarcely 20 miles from their objective they were stopped by a 'line squall of severe thunderstorms'. Clostermann was told to press on regardless.\nLuckily, the thunderstorms were not very dense in thickness and after a few minutes they emerged over the Straits of Fehmarn, near Heiligenhafen - the sky was clear before them and in a 'fraction of a second' was filled  with a whirling mass of aircraft......an unforgettable sight.\nBelow them was the big German airfield of Grossenbrode with its sea-plane base. 30-40 German fighters had swooped down on them - Clostermann quickly divided his sections in half - one half to attack the fighters and the other half to go for the transport planes.\nHe strafed a Bv138 flying boat and a Ju252 in his first pass. He then chased 3 Do24's, shooting two down. Meanwhile the dogfight was raging above him. He then dived back to the airfield, strafing an Me232 transport.\nBay, the Australian, was in difficulties and Clostermann went to his help, damaging the Messerschmitt attacking him - Bay then finished him off -sadly the German pilots parachute 'screwed up'.\nA Focke Wulf accidently formatted with them and was quickly despatched - this time the parachute did open.\nClostermann returned to Fassberg with thirteen Tempests surviving out of twenty four.\nThis was his last mission of the War - shortly afterwards Armistice was declared.\n
