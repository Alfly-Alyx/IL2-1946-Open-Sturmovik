Short The American 8th AF attack by B17 flying Fortresses and B24 Liberators on the German ball-bearing factory at Schweinfurt - return escort by  British Spitfire IXc's equipped with 90gal long range fuel tanks\n
Description 280 Flying Fortress and Liberator bombers will bomb the ball-bearing factory at Schweinfurt south-east of Bremen in the heart of Germany.\n\nDate: 14 Oct 1943\nTime: 1200\nWeather: deteriorating to rain\nCloud height: 2,700 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 400 miles\n\nGood morning gentlemen - this attack will take the 8thAF over enemy territory for more than four hours. A formidable reaction is anticipated by the Luftwaffe. Along with 9thAF and 8thAF Thunderbolts, our Spitfire Wing has been tasked to provide fighter escort to the returning bombers over northern Holland. 20 squadrons of Mustangs and Lightnings will provide long-range escort to the bombers, all the way to the target and back.\n\nFor the first time our Spitfires will be equipped  with 90gal long range fuel tanks. These tanks will enable us to takeoff from our forward strips in Norfolk and rendezvous with the bombers on their return trip over the northern German-Dutch frontier.\n\nLuftwaffe order of battle revelant to this operation is as follows:\nThe Luftwaffe has about 3,000 Messerschmitt's and Focke Wulfs at its disposal between Belgium and Denmark. (this is why we have been asked to reinforce the American fighter escort). To supplement their day fighter strength the Luftwaffe may use their nightfighters, consisting of Me110, Me410 and Ju88 fighter aircraft.\n\nYou will be controlled up to the German/Dutch frontier by Zona on frequency D, call-sign 'Railway'. The Wing Commanders call-sign will be 'Big Daddy' and The Squadron Leaders call-sign will be 'Cats eye'. \n\nAll squadron aircraft will carry 90gal drop tanks - the order to release them will be 'drop your babies' and then take up battle formation.\n\nAbsolute RT silence is compulsory until the signal is given. Indicate suspicious aircraft by use of the clock code. No. 2's must always cover their No.1's. If you have to bale out call 'May Day' on frequency H for a transmission fix. As usual, Coastal Command flying boats will be patrolling the Channel.\n\nDon't forget to switch on your I.F.F. and check your sights.\n\nSynchronize your watches, it is exactly 11 hours 41 minutes 30 seconds....one....two....three.... it is 11 hours 42 minutes zero seconds. Take care when landing with the heavy tanks on the Norfolk forward strips. Try and bring them all back home safely and good luck.  \n\nMission notes: This mission was designed to simulate a 'real-time' scenario with the use of the large Gulf of Finland map. The mission is based on a chapter from Pierre Clostermann's book 'The Big Show'. You will meet a crippled B24 Liberator, escorted by Flying Fortresses over Holland and try to 'beat-off' concentrated Fock Wulf attacks.\nDuring this mission you will be able to watch the actual attack on Schweinfurt and the Luftwaffe reaction.\nOut of 280 Fortresses and Liberators that set out on this fateful day only 50 were airworthy when they returned. The allies lost over 100 aircrew  and 51 fighter aircraft. The Luftwaffe lost 187 fighter aircraft. The Schweinfurt ball-bearing factory was raised to the ground.\n\n
