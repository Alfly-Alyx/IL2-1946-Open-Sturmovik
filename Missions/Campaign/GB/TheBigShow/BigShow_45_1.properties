Short Operation Varsity - 6th British Airborne Div. and the 17th US Airborne Div. establish a major position over the Rhine at  Wesel.  The town and airstrip are first bombed by 186 Lancasters (Pe8's).\n
Description Operation Varsity\nThe aim of the last major airborne operation of World War II was to drop two airborne divisions on the far bank of the Rhine in the Wesel sector. This would hopefully disrupt hostile German defence and seize key terrain in order to rapidly deepen the bridgehead to facilitate further offensive operations into Germany.\n\nOur main mission is to help escort the major airborne assault of Dakotas and gliders of the 6th British Airborne Division in their attack on Wesel.\n\nDate: 24th Mar 1945\nTime: 06:50\nWeather: Blind\nCloud Height: 3,600 feet (1100m)\nApproximate distance to target area: 90 miles\n\nAfter escorting the airborne division to the target area, you will carry out an armed reconnaissance looking for targets of opportunity.\n\nMission notes: Clostermann's section of Tempests escorted part of the airborne division and watched 'the apocalyptic spectacle' take place - thousands of white parachutes, Dakotas crashing in flames and gliders landing on high tension wires. (You can look at part of this spectacle while flying the mission). Surprisingly the Luftwaffe only slightly interfered during the airborne assault - most of their airfields being temporarily put out of action by the bombing.\nClostermann's section found an armoured train near Ringerberg and a convoy of panzers in the streets of Bocholt - both targets were destroyed and left in flames. One of Clostermann's pilots was shot down, receiving a direct hit from 37mm flak.\n
