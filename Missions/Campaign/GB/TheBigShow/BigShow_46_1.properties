Short Rheine/Hopsten\n
Description Lapsley has advised that the Luftwaffe will try to evacuate their jet aircraft towards the interior, taking advantage of the last minutes of twilight.\nPierre Clostermann was invited to lead an experienced 4 plane patrol to keep an eye on Rheine/Hopsten jet fighter base.\n\nDate: 24th Mar 1945\nTime: 20:40\nWeather: Blind\nCloud Height: 3,000 feet (900m)\nApproximate distance to patrol area: 100 miles\n\nClostermann selected Tiny (an Australian) as his No.2, Peter West as his No.3, and Torpy as his No.4. \nBy 21:00 they were closing to within a few miles of Rheine/Hopsten.\n\nMission notes: When they arrived over Rheine/Hopsten they noticed that the airfield had been badly bombed earlier in the day, which hopefully had knocked out some of the formidable flak. They also noticed that the airfield was a scene of intense activity - two long bright turbine flames betrayed an Me262 taking off.\nHeavy cumulus rain clouds began closing in which suddenly made the scene very dark making it impossible to see the airfield and judge proportions and distances.\nClostermann then saw two bright exhaust flames belonging to a Ju88 which was passing very close to them - he immediately opened fire seeing his cannon fire exploding on the wings of the Ju88 and causing an extensive fire. Then there was a dazzling explosion - his No.2 Tiny had misjudged the distance and crashed into the burning Ju88.\nShocked at what had just happened Clostermann lost control of his aircraft, gaining control low over the top of Rheine/Hopsten - his aircraft was badly hit by flak and he was wounded in the leg.\nAfter limping back to Volkel, he made a spectacular wheels up landing, then spent the next six days in the Eindhoven Hospital recovering.\n
