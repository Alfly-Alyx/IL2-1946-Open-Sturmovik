Short Part 1. A Success and the End - A Classic dogfight\n\n\n
Description Scramble, south-east of Caen - as many aircraft as possible. A large formation of German fighter aircraft have been picked up on the radar heading towards the beach-head.\n\nDate: 2nd Jul 1944\nTime: 11:20\nWeather: Hazy\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet (1500m)\nDistance to target: 20 miles\n\nMission notes: This was the classic dog-fight that Pierre Clostermann excelled at.\nHere are some extracts from his vivid writings in his book 'The Big Show.'\n\n'A solid mass of 40 German fighters was emerging from the clouds, 3,000 feet above us.'\n\n'Break port! Climbing! Full throttle, 3,000 rev's a minute, we faced the avalanche.'\n\n'They were Focke Wulf Ta152's (Sic) -( they were actually long-nose Fw190D's).\n\n'The sky began to be a whirling kaleidescope of black crosses'.\n\n'I fixed one of them now!  A Focke Wulf - he was circling, his black crosses edged with yellow and his cockpit glittering in the Sun'.\n\n'My 20mm shells tore into him, advancing towards the engine in a series of explosions and sparks that danced on the aluminium'.\n\n'I had a last vision of the Focke Wulf disappearing down below like a Comet,  towards the shroud of clouds covering the Orne canal.'\n\nClostermann shot down two Fw190D's in this action with another probable - he also damaged another two Focke Wulfs.\n
