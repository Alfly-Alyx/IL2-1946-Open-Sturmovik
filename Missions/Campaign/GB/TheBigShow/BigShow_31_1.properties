Short Part 2. A Success and the End - Dawn patrol inland from beachhead - bounced by JG2 Long nose Focke Wulfs\n\n\n
Description Red section will carry out an early morning high altitude patrol of the following German airfields inland from the beach head - Saint-Paul, Argentan and St.Martin.\n\nDate: 3 Jul 1944\nTime: 05:15\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet (1500m)\nWeather: Good (some fog and mist in valleys)\nDistance to target: 30 miles\n\nWe are hoping to 'draw-up' some German fighter reaction with this high level sweep.\nClimb to 20,000 feet (6000m) and be careful of 37mm, 88mm and 128mm flak, especially near major towns and airfields.\nKeep your eyes open for the 'unexpected bounce' - especially up-sun.\n\nLuftwaffe order of battle: 30+ Messerschmitt 109K's and 60+ Long-nose Focke Wulfs at Saint Paul's, 40+ Focke Wulfs at Argentan and 50+ Messerschmitts at St.Martin.\n\nCheck your sights, switch on your I.F.F. and double check your oxygen supplies.\n\nGood Luck\n\nMission notes: This is a fictitious mission - though would have been 'fairly typical' of what Clostermann's squadron was doing at the time.\n
