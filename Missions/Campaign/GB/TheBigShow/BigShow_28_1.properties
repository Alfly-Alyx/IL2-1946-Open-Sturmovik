Short An Unnecessary Disaster\n
Description Red and Blue sections will attack German road convoys, near the Beny Bocage, which are trying to re-supply their Panzer tanks with fuel and ammunition.\n\nDate: 23 Jun 1944\nTime: 17:30\nWeather: Poor\nCloud Height: 4,300 feet  (1300m)\nDistance to Target: 20 miles\n\nFly one four plane and one two plane section to seek-out and destroy any German supply convoys near the Beny Bocage. 30gal drop tanks are to be carried.\n\nMission notes: This was a particularly sad mission for Clostermann and his Squadron Commander Maxie Sutherland - losing two of their best pilots - 'Jimmy' and Mouse Manson. Another two new pilots were also shot down during this action.\nThe two Spitfire sections soon spotted a German road convoy being closely escorted by two Focke Wulfs. The Focke Wulfs immediately attacked, quickly shooting down the two new pilots (including the new Wing Commander).\n After a desperate fight with the Focke Wulfs, Clostermann soon realised that the German pilots were 'real pro's'. (They may have been JG26's Col. Josef 'Pips' Priller and his wingman - who were in action in the area at the time).\nAs the fight progressed, both 'Jimmy' and Mouse Manson were shot down and killed, with Clostermann just getting away by the 'skin of his teeth'.\n\n\n
