Short Bomb Practice - 602 and 132 Spitfire IX Sqns equip with 500lb bombs to attack V1 Rocket sites - time to practice\n
Description Date: Mar 1944\nTime: 1200\nWeather: Good\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\n\nWe have re-equipped with our new Spitfire IXc's and will leave for Llandedr, on the North Wales coast, for our first bombing practice trials.\n\nOur Spitfires will carry 500lb bombs instead of the auxilliary drop tanks. We will practice dive bombing techniques at Llandedr along with 132 Sqn.\n\nAfter mastering dive bombing will be attacking various No-Ball sites (V1 Rocket sites) along the French coast.\n\nRemember dive bombing with Spitfires is a technique on its own. If you bomb vertically the propeller is torn off by the bomb. If you bomb at 45 degrees, aiming is very difficult.\n\nThe boffins tell us that the following method of dive bombing is the best.\nMake for the objective at 12,000 feet in close reverse echelon formation. As soon as the leader sees the target appear under the trailing edge of his wing he begins diving, followed by the remainder at 75 degrees. Dive down to 3,000 feet at full throttle and at that point begin to straighten out, count to three and let your bomb go.\n\nSorry chaps, this sounds rather rudimentary though it seems to work.\n\nLets go.\n\n
