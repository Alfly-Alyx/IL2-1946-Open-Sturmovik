Short Flames in the Dusk\n
Description G.C.C. (Group Central Control) require an evening patrol at dusk to cover the Bremen/Hamburg sector. The Luftwaffe have been reacting in strength at dusk along the Hamburg/Berlin autobahn, shooting and bombing Allied advanced columns and hindering their progress.\n9 Tempests were operational, 4 being required for armed reconnaissance and 3 left for Pierre Clostermann to mount the dusk patrol.\n\nDate: 20th Apr 1945\nTime: 17:30\nWeather: Rain/Snow\nCloud Height: 2,300 feet (700m)\nApproximate distance to patrol area: 200 miles\n\nMission notes: 10 minutes of precious twilight was lost because of engine problems with one of the Tempests.\nFlying at low level in driving rain, they set course for Bremen. Visibility became worse - Clostermann thought 'the Huns' were sure to come out.\nEventually they picked up the autobahn which marked the Allied front line position.\n(1835) Somwhere behind the flight an eruption of tracer fire began - Clostermann's plane was hit by Allied flak (he wasn't happy). While trying to send their proper recognition signals - 'Like a shoal of fish passing under the skiff, thirty Focke Wulfs appeared' (one of Clostermann's classic quotes from his book 'The Big Show').\nIn the ensuing dogfight, one of his Tempests appeared to be shot down, his own aircraft being hit by mauser cannon fire. He quickly recovered and shot down a Focke Wulf that had blundered in front of him. He then chases another Focke Wulf over the city of Bremen pursued by 4 Focke Wulfs. He eventually shoots his quarry down, gives his chasing Focke Wulfs 'the slip' and with hydraulic line damage limps back to his base. He then makes another spectacular 'belly landing' - this time walking away without injury.\nResult of the trip? Two Focke Wulfs destroyed by Clostermann, another damaged by Gordon (his Wingman). All his Tempests were badly damaged, though repairable.\n
