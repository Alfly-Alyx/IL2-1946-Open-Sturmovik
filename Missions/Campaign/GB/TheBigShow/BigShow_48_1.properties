Short Clouds, Snow and Focke Wulfs - 2 (Encounter with the Dornier Do-335 and Heinkel He-162)\n
Description Carry out an armed reconnaissance of the Luneburg area, going as far as the river Elbe. Pay particular attention to trains and road convoys - also look at the airfields of  Wunsdorf, Celle and Fassberg.\n\nDate: 11th Apr 1945\nTime: 13:05\nWeather: Rain/snow\nCloud height: 2,600 feet (800m)\nApproximate distance to patrol area: 150 miles\n\nMission notes: (1) After strafing a train sheltering in a small marshalling yard and losing a Tempest to very accurate flak (the pilot bailing out and surviving) they pressed on towards the river Elbe. On the way they strafed a few panic-stricken lorries and skirted around the three German airfields, which seemed totally deserted.\nAs they were approaching Luneburg they came across a very strange looking German aircraft approaching very rapidly at tree-top level. Clostermann and Longley chased it at full throttle, firing at it ineffectively - they were doing nearly 500mph and the aircraft was easily gaining on them. They gave up the chase and again pushed onto the Elbe.\nThis strange aircraft turned out to be the first sighting of the Do335 (which has been superbly modelled by Oleg and his team).\n(2) Later that day Longley had gone off on another armed reconnaissance and their section encountered a He162 coming ito land on a section of autobahn - Longley successfully shot it down. It was later revealed the Germans were producing these aircraft in an underground factory near-by and flight testing them using the Berlin/Hamburg autobahn as an airstrip.\n(I have created this He162 action, within this mission)\n
