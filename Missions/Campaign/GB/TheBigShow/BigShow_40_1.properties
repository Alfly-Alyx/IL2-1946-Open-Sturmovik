Short The Ludendorff bridge at Remagen\n
Description The U.S. 9th Armoured Division have seized, intact, the Ludendorff bridge at Remagen. Gen. Bradley is now exploiting a bridgehead over the Rhine.\nThe U.S. enclave on the right bank of the Rhine is posing a serious threat to Germany. We have been asked to provide protective air cover over the bridge to prevent Luftwaffe air attack.\n\nDate: 7th Mar 1945\nTime: 1630\nWeather: Rain/snow\nCloud Height: 900m\nApproximate distance to target: 30 miles\n\nYou will provide an 8 aircraft 'Talbot' flight to protect the bridge. Fly via Cologne then to Remagen, setting up a standing patrol.\n\nLuftwaffe order of battle: 14+ Ar234's (KG76) and 50+ Me262's (JG7) based at Rheine-Hopsten, 60+ Long nose Focke-Wulfs (JG2) at Koln(Cologne)-Ostheim.\n\nMission notes: When Clostermann arrived with his Talbot flight at the bridge they were confronted with 8 Ar234's and 30 Me262's just about to drop their bombs. They were immediately joined by 40 Long nose Focke Wulfs providing top cover.\nAfter chasing an Ar234 over the bridge, Clostermann's Tempest was thrown up , out of control, by the Arado's bomb blast - he recovered in thick cloud and was then vectored to 2 'Rats' (Me262's) escaping along the Rhine river. He was able to get a shot at one of them, though it managed to escape on one engine.\n\n\n
