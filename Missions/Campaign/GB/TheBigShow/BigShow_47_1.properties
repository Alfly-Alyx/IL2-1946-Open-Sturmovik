Description Patrol the Osnabruck, Munster, Bremen region with eight aircraft - priority train strafing.\n\nDate: 3 Apr 1945\nTime: 09:55\nWeather: Rain/Snow\nCloud Height: 2,600 feet (800m)\nApproximate distance to patrol area: 120 miles\n\nMission notes: Clostermann took his eight Tempests to 7,000 feet over Munster - the town was severely bombed - they sighted two trains, heavily defended by automatic flak - an 88mm flak battery fired on them. He decided it would be too risky to attack and kept on his patrol route.\nSuddenly the radio 'crackled' into life with curses and yells - a dogfight going on somewhere. Kenway control then ordered him back to Rheine/Hopsten where the dogfight was happening.\nFive minutes later they were in the 'thick of it'. Clostermann shot down one long nose Focke Wulf and then was badly hit by another - he successfully landed back at  B112. Rheine. (in his book 'The Big Show' he did not mention what happened to the rest of his seven aircraft, during this encounter)\n
