He gives a very graphic account of the first train attack in his book 'The Big Show'. \nDuring the second train attack, the German flak crews had been warned by radio and were ready and waiting - Red 4 decided to attack on his own and was shot down and killed by the very accurate flak.\nThey attacked three more trains on the way home then sadly tragedy struck again - with Red 3 accidently colliding with the duty Anson that was landing at the same time - 7 pilots were killed.\n
