Short Sergeant Pilot Brown\n
Description 'Scramble over Wesel at 10,000 feet - 'Rat' seen in area\n\nDate: 16 Mar 1945\nTime: 18:45\nWeather: Blind\nCloud Height: 3,600 feet (1100m)\nApproximate distance to target area: 90 miles\n\nMission notes: Pierre Clostermann and his 'rookie' wingman, Sergeant Pilot Brown were scrambled to intercept an Me262 over Wesel.\nArriving 15 minutes later at Wesel, they were just in time to see their Me262 disappearing into clouds. They were then bounced by 4 Long nose Focke Wulfs with Brown being quickly shot down and sadly killed.\nWing Commander Brooker had lost 17 pilots during this month - they had destroyed 24 German planes and 52 locomotives. 'Tempest pilots didn't grow on every bush'. There were lots of stupid accidents and the pilots nerves were in pieces. This was the pressure scenario that Sergeant Pilot Brown arrived in, even after Clostermann 'tried to put him under his wing' he sadly didn't survive.\n
