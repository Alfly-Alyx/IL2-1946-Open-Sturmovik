Short \u0020Eventful Landings - Spitfire LFVd's takeoff to try and intercept a low flying German recon aircraft flying over Scapa Flow. On returning P/O Pierre Clostermann crash lands his Spitfire LOD due to the undercarriage pneumatic system failing.\n
Description You are to carry out an evening patrol of the Scapa Flow Naval Base to prevent any German aircraft carrying out a surprise bomb attack.\n\nDate: 7th Mar 1944\nTime: 19:45\nWeather: Clear, then closing in with fog\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet (1500m)\n\nPatrol the Naval anchorage, being careful not to cross any barrage balloon areas.\n\nYou will be controlled during the flight by Novar on frequency D. Your call-signs are Dalmat Red one and Dalmat Red two.\n\nMission notes: Pierre Clostermann and Jacque took off and were soon vectored onto a German Bandit travelling very fast under 1,000 feet. After a dozen contradictory courses amoungst the small islands, in pursuit of an elusive Ju88, they were ordered home....\nBefore landing, Clostermann discovered that his pneumatic system had 'packed up' and his radiator temperature was rising dramatically. He was then forced to make an emergency 'wheels up' night landing which he survived, walking away severely bruised.\n
