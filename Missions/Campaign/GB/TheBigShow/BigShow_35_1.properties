Short Commands in the RAF - First flight in the Typhoon and Tempest\n
Description After a good rest, Pierre Clostermann volunteered his services and returned to active service with a desire to fly the new Tempest fighter as part of 122 Wing based in Holland.\nHe made his way to Aston Down where 83 Group Support Unit was based. Here he 'checked out' - first on the Typhoon and then on the Tempest.\n\nJoin him on his first Tempest check flight.\n\nMission notes: From his book 'The Big Show' are some extracts about the mighty Tempest fighter (which has been superbly modelled by Oleg and his team).\n\nFrom the Hurricane, Hawker's Sydney Camm, had progressed to produce the Typhoon. This aircraft ultimately became a heavy assault fighter, powered by the new 24 cylinder 2,180HP Napier Sabre IIA engine. It had a thick wing capable of carrying heavy ordenance loads and aquitted itself very well against German panzers at the Falsaiz gap after D-Day.\n\nAfter another 6 months of work Sydney Camm transformed the Typhoon into the Tempest which became the ultimate piston engined WWII fighter. Powered by a 2,200HP Napier Sabre IIB engine it achieved a maximum level true air speed of 440mph with an emergency 'overboost' which could increase the speed to 460mph.\nThe fuselage was 2 feet longer than the Typhoon enabling it to house an extra 80gal of fuel. The undercarriage was lengthened to allow the use of a 12 foot 4 blade propeller. The undercart spread was increased to 16 feet to increase ground stability. Thinner elliptical wings were developed with special Dunlop tyres and 4X20mm Hispano cannons, each with 800 rounds, to fit into them.\nThe aircraft was astonishingly slender with a big 'angry looking' radiator. The cockpit was moved further aft and given a transparent 'blister' canopy. To ensure perfect stability, the tail area was doubled in size.\nOperational radius was 740 miles - increased to 1,530 miles with two 90gal drop tanks. Service ceiling was 36,500 feet.\n
