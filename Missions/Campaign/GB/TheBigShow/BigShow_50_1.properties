Short Into the Inferno of Flak\n
Description Schwerin airfield - 40 Messerschmitts seen by Spitfire recon - about 100 aircraft on base - 15 Arado 2 seaters near refuelling point 500yds S.E. of Hangar. Map ref. 829 GAII - Good Luck!\n\nDate:\nTime: 12:15\nWeather: Hazy\nCloud Height: 4,300 feet (1300m)\nApproximate distance to target: 150 miles\n\nMission notes: The Luftwaffe had established 'Einsatz' airfields (satellite airfields) as a result of their main airfields being continually bombed. They rotated 15 fighter wings between these airfields, only to stay long enough to refuel. In this way the Luftwaffe kept the pressure up on the Allied advance, especially in the mornings and afternoons.\nClostermann's Wing had been tasked to attack one of these 'Einsatz' airfields while the German fighters were refuelling.\nFlak suppression Typhoons had been organised to support his attack.\n(Each German wing had one 'Abteilungen' flak unit attached to it - consisting of one battery of 9x37mm flak guns and two batterys of 12x20mm quadruple flak guns).\n\nAs they were approaching Schwerin airfield they were told that the Typhoons would not be available. Diving out of the Sun from 14,000 feet 8 Tempests attacked - Clostermann successfully strafed the Arado's and when reforming, only one other Tempest joined him - Bay Adams, the Australian. He had lost 6 Tempests during this attack?\nA recon Spitfire XIV returned with photos of the airfield after the attack - 2 Messerschmitts had been destroyed and 5 Arado's - poor compensation for the loss of 6 Tempests!\nThis type of attack was given up - the flak held too many trumps.\n\n
