Short The Normandy Landing - We Shoot up Saint-Andre\n
Description 602 Sqn will carry out a beach-head patrol sweeping inland over Caen to Saint-Paul, Coutances and Valognes to intercept any German aircraft heading towards the Allied beach-head.\n\nDate: 8th Jun 1944\nTime: 09:50\nWeather: Poor\nCloud height: 3,600 feet (1100m)\nDistance to target: 170 miles\n\nMission notes: Pierre Clostermann and Jacques convinced Maxie Sutherland (their Squadron Leader) to attach themselves to the morning beach-head patrol (12 Spitfires), then break formation near Caen, slipping away towards Lisieux to carry out a low level attack on Saint-Andre* airfield.\nThe 'hair-raising' mission that followed, thankfully went very well with both pilots surviving unscathed.\nBoth Spitfires, travelling at over 450mph to avoid the flak, flew low over the airfield - Clostermann shot down a Me109G coming in to land and Jaques machine-gunned a row of Heinkel 111's, seeing one of them collapse in flames with a colossal explosion following.\nThe Intelligence Officers (Spys) were lukewarm at the de-briefing, until there heard descriptions of 'rows of emerald green Focke Wulfs warming up under the trees'. The next day, a secret Air Ministry bulletin reported that the Luftwaffe had re-inforced this sector with six Wings from the Russian Front.\n* After the War, Clostermann learned that the airfield they had strafed was Dreux and not Saint- Andre.\n
