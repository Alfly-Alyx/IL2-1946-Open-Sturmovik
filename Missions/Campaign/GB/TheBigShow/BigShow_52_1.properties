Short The Door Closes\n
Description Armistice has been declared - the door closes.\n(Quote from his book 'The Big Show') - eight days of bewilderment - an indiffinable mixture of gladness and regret.\nComment from Ken Hughes (one of his pilots) 'Well, Pierre, that's that, they won't need us any more' - and he was right.\nSurviving a tragic flypast at Bremerhaven, when he lost 3 pilots from his own section after they 'tangled up', Clostermann was obviously badly shaken and then became very depressed. Soon afterwards, he crashed his aircraft on landing, walking away unscathed - his nerves had finally had it.\n\nHe made his last Tempest flight after visiting RAF H.Q. at Schleswig - quoting 'coming back, I had taken him (Le Grand Charles) high up in the cloudless summer sky, for it was only there that I should fittingly take my leave...."in the narrow cockpit, he wept as he shall never weep again"... on landing, I carefully cleared the Napier Sabre engine, turned off all the switches, one by one, removed the straps, the wires and the tubes which tied me to him, like a child to his mother.\n\nHe sat next to the pilot of the B25 Mitchell bomber which took him back to Paris. Taking off, he gazed at his 'Grand Charles' - my old JF-E with its red spinner, the black crosses of our victories under the cockpit, compact, determined and powerful looking, with its motionless four-bladed propeller, which would never again be started by me. It was like turning the page in a book.\n\nPierre Clostermann died at his home in the Pyrenees on March 22nd 2006, he was 85.\n\nFor all the IL2 fans, hopefully this 52 mission campaign is a fitting tribute to him. He was my boyhood hero and I thank Oleg Maddox and his team for giving me such a wonderful flight sim to re-create his story.\n\nDFLion\n
