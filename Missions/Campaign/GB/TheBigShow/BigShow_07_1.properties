Over the target area the Wing will range ahead of the bombers to protect them against anticipated German fighter attack.\nThunderbolts from the American 8th Airforce will fly as strategic reserve, protecting the bombers as they return from the target area.\nTyphoons from 609 Sqn will create a diversion by dive bombing the St.Omer airfield.\n\nLuftwaffe (JG26) order of battle - 30+ Focke Wulfs at Abbeville, 30+ Focke Wulfs at St.Omer, 20+ Focke Wulfs at Calais and 60+ Focke Wulfs at Amiens/Glisy.\n\nYou will be controlled over the objective by Appledore on frequency C, call-sign Grass Seed. The Wing Commanders call-sign is Gimlet and the Squadron Leaders call-sign is Turban.\n\nAll squadron aircraft will carry 30gal drop tanks - the order to release them will be 'drop your babies' and then take up battle formation.  If running short of fuel make for Manston.\n\nAbsolute RT silence is compulsory until the signal is given. Indicate suspicious aircraft by use of the clock code. No.2's must always cover their No.1's. If you have to bale out call 'May Day' on frequency D for a transmission fix. Flying boats will be patrolling the Channel.\n\nDon't forget to switch on your I.F.F.* and check your sights.\n\nSynchronize your watches; it is exactly 17 hours 42 minutes 30 seconds....one....two...three....it is 17 hours 43 minutes zero seconds.\n\nGood luck.\n\nMission notes: *I.F.F. (Identification 'Friend or Foe') electronic device.\nPierre Clostermann was flying as No.2 to Commandant Mouchotte. In the first contact with enemy fighters he lost contact with him by pulling up his aircraft too hard, making the engine cut out.\nLater in the fight, Commandant Mouchotte was isolated from the rest of the Wing and sadly shot down and killed. The Wing was hopelessly 'outnumbered' 200FW's to 24 Spitfire IX's\nClostermann went on to chase and shoot down a Focke Wulf near the village of Hazebrouck.\n\n\n
