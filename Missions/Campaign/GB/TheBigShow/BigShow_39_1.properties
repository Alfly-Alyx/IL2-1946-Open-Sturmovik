Short 'Rat Catching'\n
Description The Messerschmitt 262 was fast becoming a real nuisance - everyday, appearing over the front line to photograph, machine gun and bomb Allied positions.\n\nDate: 3 Mar 1945\nTime: 06:50\nWeather: Blind\nCloud Height: 3,600 feet (1100m)\nApproximate distance to patrol area: 50 miles\n\nKenway control was having extreme difficulty picking the jets up on radar because of their 600mph speed.\nWing Commanders Lapsley and Brooker have worked out a means of intercepting these jets. The 'Rat Code' was born (which was soon called the 'Bastard Code' by the pilots).\nWe will keep two pairs of Tempests on permanent state of immediate alert. As soon as '262' crosses the Rhine towards our lines - 'scramble rat'  will be ordered.\nThe quarry being too fast for any attempt to catch it, the two Tempests would immediately make for Rhine/Hopsten jet fighter base and patrol its approaches at 10,000 feet. When the 262 slows down to land, the Tempests would intercept and shoot it down.\n\nMission notes: On this mission Pierre Clostermann and his No.2 go after a 'rat'.\nThe Germans soon found an answer to 'Rat Catching'. The 262's were told to return to their base at high speed and only slow up when they were well within the flak lane. The flak lane was a 5 mile long, double row of 160 quadruple 20mm flak guns! \n
