Short Fight in the Fog\n
Description You are to carry out a radar calibration flight and reconnaissance in the L'Aigle/Gace region.\n\nDate: 29th Jun 1944\nTime: 17:30\nWeather: Rain/Snow\nCloud Height: 2,600 feet (800m)\nPatrol Area: L'Aigle/Gace region\n\nUnfortunately the weather is very poor this afternoon, with heavy rain showers. Take-off and fly a circuitous route via Lisieux, reporting to our controller at each turning point. \nYou will be passing close to the German fighter base at St. Martin - try to avoid contact with any enemy fighters.\n\nMission notes: On this mission Clostermann became hopelessly lost, flying in very low cloud. He then set a course north, making for the coast and climbing to 10,000 feet to get above the poor weather.\nOn breaking out of the cloud, in dazzling sunshine, he suddenly spotted a dozen black spots approaching him at high speed - they were Focke Wulfs!\nAfter a hectic chase, with his Spitfire suffering cannon damage, he managed to 'shake-off' his pursuers. \nFlying low again, under the cloud base he suddenly came upon one of the Focke Wulf's that had chased him. He managed to 'sneak-up' behind the Focke Wulf, which was following a railway line, and shot it down in flames, seeing it explode on impact.\nClostermann landed back at B11 with under a gallon of petrol left in his Spitfire's tanks.\n
