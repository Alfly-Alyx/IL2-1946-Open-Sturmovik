Short Tempest v. Focke-Wulf\n
Description 'A' Flight led by Sqn Leader Fairbanks will carry out a 'train busting' mission this afternoon in the Bremen area - search for and destroy any trains encountered.\n\nDate: 28th Feb 1945\nTime: 16:30\nCloud Height:  3,300 feet (1000m)\nWeather: Blind\nApproximate distance to target: 90 miles\n\nMission notes: The section of six Tempests included 3 young inexperienced pilots - Clostermann thought this was too many to have in the section.\nAfter ineffectively attacking a train, with one aircraft being hit by dense and accurate flak, the section proceeded in zigzags as far as Osnabruck.\nKenway controller then came on asking for a 'Canary fix' * - enemy aircraft where then seen on the controller's radar close to the section's position.\nSuddenly a mixed group of over 40 long nose Focke Wulfs and Messerschmitts were on top of them. Spence was the first to be shot down and there was no sign of Fairbanks. Pierre Clostermann was then chased by four Focke Wulfs, managing to shake them off with a vertical dive at over 500mph. \nWhen returning to Volkel, it was established that both Spence and Sqn Ldr Fairbanks were missing. It was later confirmed, that both pilots were shot down and made Pow's. After the war, Sqn Ldr Fairbanks claimed 1 Fw190 shot down in this action.\n\n*Canary - a secret apparatus which sent out a radar signal when a yellow button was pressed. This signal was intercepted on the controller's radar in a different colour, which helped identify friend and foe.\n
