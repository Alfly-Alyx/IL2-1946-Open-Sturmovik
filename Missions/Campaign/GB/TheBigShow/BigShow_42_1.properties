Short Walter Nowotny\n
Description Talbot flight 'Rat Scramble' to Rheine/Hopsten - Me262 sighted returning to airfield.\n\nDate: 15th Mar 1945\nTime: 06:50\nWeather: Blind\nCloud Height: 3,600 feet (1100m)\nDistance to patrol area: 80 miles\n\nMission notes: Clostermann's Talbot section (4 Tempests) was 'Rat Scrambled' to Rheine/Hopsten. On arriving over the airfield at 8,000 feet, they sighted an uncamouflaged Me262 - 'glittering in the sun' in the flak corridor and about to land. One of Clostermann's pilots decided to attack the jet, miraculously passing through the 'wall of flak' without being hit and shooting down the 'silvery' Me262 with a long burst of cannon fire.\nLater it was confirmed that Bob Clarke had shot down Walter Nowotny who had died of severe burns 2 days later in the Osnabruck Hospital.\nIronically this  was a sad day for both German and Allied fighter pilots as Walter Nowotny was highly respected by both sides as an outstanding and fair fighter pilot. He had personally and violently protested to Adolf Hitler on the shooting of 47 allied pilots by the Gestapo who had tried to escape.\nAt the time of his death, 22 year old Obertleutnant (Wing Commander) Walter Nowotny was in command of JG52 with over 200 fighter aircraft. He was credited with over 100 victories on the Russian front and 60 on the Western front. He had been awarded Germany's highest military honour - an Iron Cross with Swords, Diamonds and Oak Leaves.\n
