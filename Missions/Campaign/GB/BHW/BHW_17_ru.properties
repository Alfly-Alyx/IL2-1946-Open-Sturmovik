Description 5 February, 1943\n15:00\n\nHello Chaps,\n\nRodeo to France. We'll cross the coast near Audembert at 15,000 feet, then we turn South. Nothing more to say. Never stop scanning the sky for the one who sees the enemy first wins the battle. It's essential to see the Hun before he sees us. If we bag  more than 5, I'll pay a pint for everyone back at the pub!\n\n
