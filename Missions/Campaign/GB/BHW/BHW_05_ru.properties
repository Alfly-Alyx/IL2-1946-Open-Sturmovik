Short Circus - Cherbourg\n
Description 21 September, 1942\n7:30\n\nHello Chaps! \n\nHurry up, we have rendez-vous with 8 Blenheims at 7:40 sharp over the Isle of Wight. They are going to act as baits as  the Circus flies over Cherbourg and Carentan. Remember Sailor Malan's rule: Never fly straight and level in combat area for more than 10 seconds! Off we go!\n
