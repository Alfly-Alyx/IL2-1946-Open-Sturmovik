Short U boat\n
Description 6 December, 1942\n7:00\n\n'Morning Gents.\n\nOur intelligence has just reported that a German U-boat is about to rendez-vous with a seaplane in an uncomfortable proximity of a convoy. A pair of Spitfires is required to escort a PBN who will attack the U-boat. The seaplane is ours. Make damn sure none of them makes it to France!\n
