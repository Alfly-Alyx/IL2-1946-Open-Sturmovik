Short Spitfire\n
Description Biggin Hill Airfield\n27 August, 1942\n9:00\n\nAllright old chap! Done with the pilot notes? Go and throw her around a 'bit. Remember, low level aerobatics are strictly forbidden. If I catch you doing a roll below 2,000 feet I'll get you court-martialled!\n\n\nNOTE: Chose the skin Spitfire_IXb_FYB, and use it throughout the campaign.\n
