Short Fighter sweep - Abbeville\n
Description 6 October, 1942\n11:00\n\nWell done, chaps! Fighter Command has just sent a message to congratulate us for the succesful interception of those Junkers-88s last week. Bloody good show!\n\nToday's sortie is a rodeo to St Omer. There's been very little enemy activity over France lately, but keep your eyes open, you never know when a gaggle of 109s will bounce you out of the sun.\n
