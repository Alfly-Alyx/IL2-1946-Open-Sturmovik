Short Fighter sweep - Le Havre\n
Description 20 December, 1942\n9:00\n\nGood morning, Gentlemen! \n\nLe Havre is a lovely little town by the estuary of the Seine. You might not enjoy this charming sight today for the height of this sortie is 12,000 feet.  Rendez-vous with 242 squadron over Hastings at 9,000 feet.  Climb to 12,000 feet, and continue to the West until we reach the height of the target area, then turn South. We must spend the least time possible over the Channel. The water is freezing cold this time of the year.\n\nI know you haven't seen a single Hun for a week,  but you never know when a squadron of Focke Wulfs will jump on us straight out of the sun, so watch out. Take off in 20 minutes. Dismissed.\n
