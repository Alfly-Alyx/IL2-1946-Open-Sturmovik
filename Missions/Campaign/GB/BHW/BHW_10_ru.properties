Short Circus - Le Havre\n
Description 14 November, 1942\n16:30\n\nGentlemen, we are sending a bomber formation of a considerable size to destroy German battleships anchoring in Le Havre. Those ships must be sunk at any price. The success of this sortie might have a high impact on the outcome of the battle of the Atlantic. At least, the weather is in our favour: tolerably clear skies all over the Channel. Rendez vous with the Blenheim boys at 16:40 over Beachy Head.\n
