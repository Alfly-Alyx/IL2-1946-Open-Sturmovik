Short Armstrong rescue\n
Description 5 February, 1943\n18:20\n\nBad news, Chaps. I'm afraid the CO is missing. It's been 3 hours, so he should have already returned by now. Let's hope he's in the soup waiting for a rescue boat to pick him up. He was last seen tangling with 2 Fw-190s about 10 miles from the coast. I'm going back to sweep this area.  Who's coming with me?\n\n
