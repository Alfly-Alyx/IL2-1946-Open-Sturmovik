Short Patrol Beachy head\n
Description 15 September, 1942\n7:00\n\nGood morning.\n\nToday they need us to patrol along the coast. Rye-Fairlight-Beachy Head. Lately the Hun is sending a pair of fighters or two with bombs, who sneak in under the RADAR, drop their bombs, and run for home. They can't cause much damage, but they're a bit of a nusiance for the civilians.\n
