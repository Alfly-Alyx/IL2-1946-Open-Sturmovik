Short Rodeo along the french coast\n
Description 2 September, 1942\n14:00\n\nGood afternoon gents. \n\nToday we are performing a Rodeo along the French coast together with the Tangmere wing. The objective is to make the Hun take off and engage. We will reach the French coast near Berck-sur-mer at 16,000 feet. We continue our journey along the coastline until we reach Dieppe, when we turn for home. There's a lot of enemy airfields around, so you can expect a hell of a  fight today! Never enter a combat all alone! The new guys should stick to their leaders at any price! Go get your parachutes, and fire up your Spitfires. Take off at 14:00 sharp.\n
