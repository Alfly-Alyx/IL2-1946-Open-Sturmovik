Short Patrol Mid - Channel\n
Description 21 December, 1942\n9:30\n\nGood morning.\n\n611 is to patrol over Mid-Channel. \n\nYesterday we lost quite a few chaps, and a lot of Spitfires are unserviceable. It was damn silly of you! You never learn that the Hun ALWAYS takes his time to position himself so that he can attack out of the sun, hoping to find such a bounch of idiots like you are? You can be in the soup in a matter of seconds, and let me assure you, the Channel in December is nothing like a hot bath.\n
