Short Tiger Moth solo\n
Description Upavon,\n15 June, 1942 \n15:00\n\nWell done, Boy! Your flying is getting better and better. You've passed all your written exams, now you have to pass your flying exam as well. Go and take that Tiger Moth, take off, fly around for at least 2 minutes, and then, make a perfect spot on landing. Go around until you land your crate exactly on that white mark. \n\nRemember, the CO is watching you closely. You make one wrong move and you end up as a tail gunner on a bloody bomber! However, if you excell, you might be on your way to an operational squadron in a month. \n\n Now off you go!\n
