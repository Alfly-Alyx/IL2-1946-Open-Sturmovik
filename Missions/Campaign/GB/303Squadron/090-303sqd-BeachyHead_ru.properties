Name Patrol to Beachy Head
Short Patrol to Beachy Head and through Sector C.\n
Description 9 September 1940\n\nAt ease...at ease.\n\nI feel I need to clear the air about something here. I understand that there have been some grumblings about treatment of Polish prisoners by our Russian allies. In particular, there is talk of some sort of mess at a place called Katyn Forest. \n\nLet me begin by saying that you men have earned a great deal of respect  from me. I feel confident that I can speak for the whole of the RAF in that regard. Well then, I'd like to think the RAF and I have earned some simliar degree of respect from you. We will look into these accusations. I give you my word. In the meantime, we can't be consumed with rumors; we have an important job to do. Remember this: Russia is an allied power in this war.\n\nHopefully today's activity won't have quite so much excitement as yesterday. Today you will patrol Sector C. As you can see, your course will take you south to Beachy Head, northeast along the coast  through the Hastings area, and home.\n\nGet into the air. I will make some inquiries about this business at Smolensk.\n\n\n
