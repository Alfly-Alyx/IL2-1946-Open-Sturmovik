Name Welcome to Northolt
Short Experienced Polish pilots escape from the continent following the fall of Poland and join the RAF.  Welcome to 303 Squadron, located at Northolt, east of London.\n
Description August 29, 1940\n\nGood morning gentlemen. I welcome our new Polish pilot. In his honor, I will go over our usual briefing and discuss some of the 303 squadron rules. \n\nToday, we will take off, then rendevous with a Blenheim...\n\nAlright, gentlemen, stop that Polish jibberish this instant! The next man to speak Polish in my presence will be grounded for a week! Understood?\n\nYou are in the RAF now. You will learn to fly the Hawker Hurricane, and you will earn to fly well and in a disciplined manner. Am I being clear? You will perform practice flights tailing that Blenheim until I say it is time to do otherwise. Is that clear? You'll learn to love that bloody Blenheim until one of us is dead, and I am feeling in quite good health, thank you. If you aren't so keen on this I will find you a nice job in the infantry. It would be my pleasure.\n\nAlright then. As I was saying you will follow the circular route on your briefing map and rendezvous with the Blenheim.  Follow him as far as the map point south of Reading, then head home to Northolt.\n\nI will reiterate for our new pilot and all the rest of you lot:  you are not to engage the enemy during your training flights. If you encounter enemy activity of any kind whatsoever, radio the position and get back here.\n\nCarry on.\n
