Name Rochester Patrol
Short 303 Squadron patrols over London, to Rochester Channel.\n
Description 5 October 1940\n\nThings have been quiet now for several days. Perhaps the German bully has tired of having his nose bloodied.  It appears that the enemy has stopped the massive daylight bombing raids. I dare say we have made that strategy a bit too costly. We expect they will hit us with waves of fighters next and try to lower our strength and our resolve. That's a laugh, now isn't it.\n\nWe will resume with our patrols now that the scrambles have let up somewhat. Today, we will cover London, then east to the Rochester Channel, and back home.\n\nOne bit of news today. I will be stepping aside as your commanding officer in the next few days. It is time for your own Polish leadership to take over. It is past time, I must admit.\n\nI'm not the sentimental type you know, but I would just like to take this moment to tell you that you are a damn fine bunch of pilots...excuse me...I seem to have a speck of something in my eye...where was I again? Oh yes, a damn fine bunch of pilots. It has been an honour serving with you, and I shall not forget a one of you. No, not a one.\n\nOf you go then. Give them a bash.\n
