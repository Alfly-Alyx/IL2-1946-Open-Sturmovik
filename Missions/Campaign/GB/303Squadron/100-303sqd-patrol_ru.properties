Name Routine Patrol
Short After heavy action, 303 Squadron welcomes a routine patrol to the channel.\n
Description 10 September 1940\n\nAt ease. Good morning all.\n\nThis morning's patrol should be strictly routine. The weather is dreadful again, so those damn bombers couldn't find a target if they tried.\n\nYou'll bear south today and patrol the channel front in the Portsmouth area. Keep a sharp eye for any aircraft that might be interested in interfering with merchant shipping.\n\nWe will expect  you for luncheon.\n
