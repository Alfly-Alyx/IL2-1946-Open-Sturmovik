Description 11 September 1940\n\nGather quickly!\n\nWe are receiving reports of a big show heading towards London. Your intercept point will be down near Horsham. You wouldn't want to miss out on this one, now would you.  Can't let the Spitfires have all the fun.\n\nGo! Go! Get up there and knock them down! They want to wear us out. Well, bollocks I say! Bollocks to that! Show them that we are nowhere close to being beaten, and we can still bloody a bully's nose.\n\nThey are getting scared now, and desperate...I can tell.\n
