Name Patrol with RCAF Squardon 1
Short 303 Squadron joins No. 1 RCAF squadron for a patrol over Biggin Hill and the Thames estuary.\n
Description 17 September 1940\n\nAt ease. Good afternoon.\n\nToday we have a joint patrol with aircraft from No. 1 RCAF Squadron.\n\nTo your maps please. As you can see, we will patrol over the Biggin Hill area, up to the Thames estuary, back to London, and home to Northolt.\n\nI have been asked, with some degree of fanfare, to request once again that you speak English in the air, for the sake of the Canadians. Well, I've yet to meet a Canadian who can speak English properly, so don't concern yourselves too much about the matter. We will buy them a pint next time we run into that lot at The Grange, and all will be forgotten, I tell you.\n\nOff you go then. Bad weather today, so it's not likely you will encounter any bombers. Keep an eye out for 109s though.\n
