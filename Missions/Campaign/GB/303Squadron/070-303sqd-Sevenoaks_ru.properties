Name Patrol and watch for  large raid at Sevenoaks
Short 303 squadron  joins Spitfires and other Hurricanes to intercept a large mixed formation over Sevenoaks.\n
Description 6 September 1940\n\nAlright, now listen carefully. We have no time for chit chat this morning. The ministry is expecting something big today...quite big.   \n\nSeems that our mutual friend Mr. Hitler did not care much for Bomber Command's raid on Berlin. Bit of a bad sport that man. It appears that Jerry has decided to bomb cities instead of airfields. Well, good news for Fighter Command and bad news for the people in the city. Londoners will handle it all right though. They are a tough lot. And don't you lads know well enough that you can't break the will of a nation with a few bombs. No, I promise you that will not work in this country either. Lucky thing we are fighting a bunch of damn fools.\n\nEyes to your maps please. You will take this course and gather altitude in order to patrol at 22,000 feet in the vicinity of London, Sevenoaks, and back to London. \n\nGo on then. Get up there. Look sharp.\n
