Name Dusk Patrol over the Dover Coast
Short 303 Squadron patrols Sector D at dusk.\n
Description September 2, 1940\n\nAt ease. \n\nWe're off to a bit of a late start today, but fighter command would like another coastal patrol before nightfall. Take a look a at your  maps please.\n\nAs you can see,  you will fly east, then patrol the coast from Dover to the Thames estuary, and return. Nothing on the radar; nothing much to expect. Nonetheless. keep those eyes open for Jerry. Keep those formations tight. They may well be sending out that one more patrol themselves.\n\nOff you go then.\n
