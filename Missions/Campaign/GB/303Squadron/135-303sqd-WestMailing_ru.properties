Name Patrol over West Mailing
Short 303 Squadron patrols over West Mailing and the Thames estuary.\n
Description 18 September 1940\n\nAt ease.\n\nDreadful weather again today. Simply dreadful. \n\nAs you can see, we will patrol the route we took yesterday: up to the Thames estuary, back to London, and home to Northolt.\n\nKeep an eye out for 109s. They will be probing us to see what we put in the sky. Do show them that we are not napping.\n\nIn spite of the rationing, my wife has managed to make some of those ginger cakes for high tea that we had last Tuesday. Do make every effort not to be late.\n
