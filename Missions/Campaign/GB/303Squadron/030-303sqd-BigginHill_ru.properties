Name An imperfect engagement
Short Fighter command makes 303 squadron operational.\n
Description September 5, 1940\n\nGood morning gentlemen. At ease...at ease. Well then, this isn't the easiest thing I've ever done. On with it then.\n\nOn your last mission you had orders to avoid engagement with the enemy. Those orders could not have been more clear. This is the RAF, not a band of riff-raff. \n\nNow that we had cleared the air, let me say one more thing. My gran taught me that a good man admits when he is wrong. It may not be an easy thing to do, but that's what a good man does. I'm not sure all of you would agree, but I like to think I am a good man. We've had our differences, the lot of you and myself, but I must say one thing here.\n\nThat was a fine bit of flying. Damn fine. I've discussed this with my superiors and we agree that 303 squadron should become operational...as of this moment.\n\nYes, yes, a bit of gibberish is understandable, but that's enough. That's enough I say!\n\nIt so happens that some Sptifires are in a bit of a row near Biggin Hill. Get up there and give your best to help out. And for god's sake follow orders this time. Don't make a damn fool of me!\n
