Name Intercept over Thameshaven
Short 303 squadron intercepts a German formation over Thameshaven\n
Description 5 September 1940\n\nAttention!\n\nI've gotten a message from a squadron leader from another base, complaining about Polish speech on the radio during air actions. \n\nI thought perhaps that you would be vaguely interested in my reply: "Sirs, kindly advise you and your pilots to direct hostile attention to enemy actvity in the air, not your allies. Also advise that you remove the batons from your backsides prior to boarding your aircraft.  This will preclude you from having either the time or the inclination to make such complaints. Respectfully, etc. and so on."\n\nMy old gran taught me that there are some things in this world that just cannot be changed.\n\nOn with the activities of the day then. \n\nLook at your maps, please. Today's patrol will take you to the south, then over to the coast, London  around Thames Haven, and home.\n\nAnd do keep the Polish chattter on the airwaves to a minimum, won't you?\n\n\n\n
