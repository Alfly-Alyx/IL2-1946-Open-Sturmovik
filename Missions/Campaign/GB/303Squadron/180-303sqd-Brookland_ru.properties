Name Scramble to Brookland
Short 303 Squadron scrambles to intercept a large enemy formation over the channel near Brookland.\n
Description 30 September 1940\n\nScramble...Scramble!\n\nWe have another wave coming already again today. It looks to be only fighters in this group. There, you see, you've scared the bombers off. You've got them on the run.\n\nReports are that there are  a lot of fighters up there...the sky is dark with German fighters they tell me. Well, we have fighters to send to meet them, don't we? And damn better pilots!\n\nInto the breach then! Once more...into the breach!\n\n
