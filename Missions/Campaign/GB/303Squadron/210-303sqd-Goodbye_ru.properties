Name The Last Battle of Britain mission
Short 303 Squadron patrols the London area one last time before being sent to Leconfield for a rest. The Battle of Britain is over.\n
Description 7 October 1940\n\nI have much to say today; none of it is easy.\n\nI'm not much good at saying good-bye, but here we are. You are now under Polish command. You and I will go off to other duties, but we will still have the common goal that bound us together these last weeks.\n\nThey are calling this the Battle of Britain. They also say that this particular battle is just about over. The Germans are switching to night attacks and dismantling their invasion fleet. \n\nWell, I have two things to tell my grandchildren. First, I fought proudly in the single most important battle in history as we know it. Second, I served with a fearless group of Poles that I am proud to call friends and allies. We haven't defeated Nazism yet, but we have shown them that they can be beaten. And we have shown them that we can beat them again and again. They are no more supermen than my brother-in-law in Toddington.\n\nOne more thing before you go off though. I have made inquiries about those rumors regarding the Katyn forest. I've been told to speak no more of it. The Russians are our allies and we are not to stir up rumors that are likely German propaganda. I will have no more of it and I advise you to put the thoughts to rest as well.\n\nSo, keep your minds on the war, and that German pilot trying to get behind you. Good luck and may we all meet again someday while on holiday.\n\nFarewell.\n\n
