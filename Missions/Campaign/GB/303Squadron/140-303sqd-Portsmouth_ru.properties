Name Portsmouth patrol
Short 303 SquadronPatrols Sector A along the channel coast from Southampton to Portsmouth..\n
Description 26 September 1940\n\nAt ease. \n\nWe have a later afternoon patrol today through Sector A.\n\nAs you can see, we will patrol over the channel coastline from Southampton, over Portsmouth, and to the sector's eastern perimeter.\n\nThe weather has cleared a bit, so we can expect that enemy bomber pilots are keen to try their luck somewhere over England today. \n\nGood luck then.\n
