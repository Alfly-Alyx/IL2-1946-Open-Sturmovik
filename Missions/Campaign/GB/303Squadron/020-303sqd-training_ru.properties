Name Practice makes perfect
Short British command continues to insist on practice and more practice for the Polish flyers. The English consider the Poles to have low morale and poor flying skills. The Poles think of themselves as combat veterans based on their experiences resisting the German invasion of Poland.\n
Description August 30, 1940\n\nGood morning gentlemen...\n\nToday we will perform another practice mission today engaging in practice attacks on a ... quiet please. I said quiet!\n\nAs I mentioned yesterday, you will keep any dissension to yourselves. I have no time for it. Things aren't going all that well in the skies, as I am sure some of you know. I am quite certain that your English is not quite as bad as you let on to me sometimes. I am no fool you know.  Some in my command want to put you into combat. I will tell you straight out I am not as desperate as that. You are not on a par with British flyers; I can see that plainly.\n\nRemember, any of that Polish jibberish in this briefing and you can sit in your barracks for a week while the others learn to fly the RAF way.\n\nPlease be seated. You will perform another practice mission today engaging in practice attacks on a Blenheim. \n\nMake your approaches from altitude, make your sightings, and for god's sake don't touch that bloody trigger. He is one of ours you know.\n\nOnce again, I must emphasize that there is to be no engagements with the enemy. \n\nRight then, carry on.\n
