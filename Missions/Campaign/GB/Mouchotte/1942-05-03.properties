Name 1942-05-03.
Short Sweep.
Description May 3rd, 1942 - 11:55 AM.\nSweep.\n\nThis mission is very simple. It's a fighter sweep over France, along the coasts.\n\nNormally, the Luftwaffe does not take off to attack flying formation composed of fighters only. But we think that these sweeps are useful, to show to Germans that they lost the operation initiative in Europe. From times to times, they counterattack these provocations and we get an occasion of reducing their combat power without any risk for the bomber crews.\n\nHowever, open your eyes and good luck!\n\nFlying altitude: 23,000 feet.\n\nSkin: SpitMkVb_Garozelis1, marking off.\n\nHistorical notes:\nCaptain Mouchotte did not fly this mission. As its execution was really simple, he decided to let the flight be led by lieutenant Gibert, who he was training for this job.
