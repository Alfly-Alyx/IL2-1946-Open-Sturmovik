Name 1941-10-29.
Short Attack of the seaplane base in Ostend.\n
Description October 29th, 1941 - 10:40 AM.\nAttack of the seaplane base in Ostend..\n\nAs the enemy ships are remaining hidden in harbours during the daylight, we shall change our target. This morning, we shall attack the seaplane base in Ostend.\n\nIn fact, the Zeenoot does not only fish out the German pilots who are fallen in the Channel. They take allied pilots too, and fetch them as prisoners of war before the arrival of the Air Sea Rescue motor boats. In addition, they may signal during these missions our convoys to the mine-layers and to Snell Boote.\n\nDestroy as many seaplanes as possible.\n \nFlying altitude: as low as possible.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-IIc- 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
