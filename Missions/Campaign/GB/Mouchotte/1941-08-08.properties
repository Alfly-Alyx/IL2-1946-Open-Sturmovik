Short Flying the complete flight.\n
Description August 8th, 1941 - 8:30 AM.\nFlying the complete flight.\n\n\"August 8\nI took my flight up today for the first time. It will be a great day when I lead it into combat."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nToday will be very quiet. No convoy in sight and the Coastal Command is enough for the routine patrols.\n\nThe complete flight will make a formation flight, flying upstream the estuary. You should know it very well now. At about 30 miles from the mouth, some targets were set on the ground. You will attack it with your machine guns. This is a premise of the missions we shall have to do soon, beyond the Channel. We shall go back to fight soon, our rest time is ending at least.\n\nFlying altitude: 1,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.\n
