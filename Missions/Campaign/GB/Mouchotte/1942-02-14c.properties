Short Scramble!
Description February 14th, 1942 - 06:15 PM.\nScramble!\n\n\nA Free French Air Force Squadron is being created. Plenty of time is lost in orders, changes in orders, and endless modifications in the pilot list. At least, on October 30...\n\n"October 30th.\nI am leaving 615 Squadron suddenly for Hornchurch. How many memories I leave behind me! ...\n\nNovember 1st.\nHere in London, having a short rest. We are in waiting at Hornchurch, posted to Turnhouse, near Edimburgh, to form the French Squadron...\n\nTurnhouse, Scotland. November 10th, 1941.\nGoodbye London! I am on my way to 340 Squadron, the first free French squadron! ...\n\nNovember 17th.\nCaptain de Scitivaux is commanding A Flight, I am his second-in-command. Captain Dup\u00E9rier is commanding B Flight, Fayolle is his second-in-command. An English Squadron Leader, Loft, will be commanding us for several months. He is a great Francophile and also an excellent fighter pilot. How long shall we stay here? I haven't had much luck. I vegetated nearly for five months at Valley, and I was unfortunate enough to have only two months on operation at Manston. Once more, I am far from the theatre of war.\n\nDecember 1st.\nWe are on the move already. One flight at least, mine. We are going further east, to Drem,  on operations. Why? High military commands have reasons that reason does not understand...\n\nDecember 25th.\nChristmas this year was spent quietly in the mess; dance has been organized.\n\nAyr, January 8th, 1942.\nWe have moved again. West coast of Scotland. Training is going on slowly...\n\nJanuary 14th.\nOur mechanics, too, are French... I am already forming a team with them, as I did for fifteen months in 615 with two excellent Englishmen...\nApart from this vital interest in having a responsible team, the pilot must wholeheartedly recognize the devotion of these good lads. In all kind of weather, rain, frost, at night, they carry on an ungrateful task with no glory attached to it, which every mechanic worthy of the name knows to be necessary and of high value... I think I now have two excellent lads: Gruget is very skilful and hard working... Moureau is very young and of a very placid type...\n\nWe have a number of Tahitian, not specialists, who are useful in several ways. They and their mandolin are inseparable and often play it for us so that we can hear nostalgic songs about their country. Their singing is very rhythmical and arouses keen interest. They sing with a sad smile, as if their memories were painful.\n\nFebruary 1st.\nLoft, our English Squadron Leader is leaving us...\n\nAs a result, Captain de Scitivaux, promoted Commandant, takes command of the Squadron...\n\nFebruary 6th.\nAll the French personal, men and officers gathered around the flag, around 250 of them. Scitivaux came forward and announced that he has taken over. At the same time, he appointed his successor to command A flight - your humble servant...\n\nFebruary 9th.\nGeneral de Gaulle is coming to visit the squadron (recently christened the 'Paris' Squadron), next Thursday.\n\nFebruary 14th.\nI gave chase to a Boche this evening..."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nScramble!\n\nWho said that nothing can occur here?\nThe sound of plane motors were heard further in the north. No allied aircraft is flying, it's a Hun. Immediate take off and shoot down this spin!\n\nFlying altitude: 20,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 1940-NN, marking off.
