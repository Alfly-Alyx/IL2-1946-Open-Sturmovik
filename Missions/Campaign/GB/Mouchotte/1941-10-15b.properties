Name 1941-10-15.
Short Attack of three Flak Ships.
Description October 15th, 1941 - 6:30 PM.\nAttack of three Flak Ships.\n\nSirs!\n\nGermans are risking less and less their ships at sea during the days. Our bombers have to fetch them now where there are, in the arbours, and this causes heavy casualties.  The enemy defences in Zeebruge were just reinforced with three Flak Ships, which are locking the roadstead entrance. Blenheim speed in too low, they cannot do the job. We have to thwart these opponents.\n\nWe shall attack this evening, taking advantage of the half-light. Do not repeat the attack, for any reason.\n\nBeware of the Flak and of the Luftwaffe.\n \nFlying altitude: as low as possible.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-IIb- 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
