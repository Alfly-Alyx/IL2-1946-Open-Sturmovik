Description March 18th, 1941 - 8:10 PM\nNight Patrol.\n\nI know that you are exhausted by the two patrols you ever did today, but there is a job going on, and this unit was appointed for it.\nOur night fighters are badly too few. They are outnumbered by the German bombers. At the beginning of the night, the days fighters shall give a hand when the nights are no too darks.\n\nPatrol over London at 20,000 feet and open your eyes!\n \nFlying altitude: 20,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-IIb - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off. \n\nAdditional remark:\nFor taking off from this base, a control key must be defined for "toggle chocks", otherwise the plane shall stay stuck on the landing strip.
