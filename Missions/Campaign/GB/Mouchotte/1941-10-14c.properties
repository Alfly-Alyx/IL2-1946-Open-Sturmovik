Name 1941-10-14.
Short "Rhubarb" in Holland.
Description October 14th, 1941 - 4:40 PM.\n"Rhubarb" in Holland.\n\nSirs!\n\nA new naval interdiction mission is planned this afternoon. It will probably be a routine check, for Germans seem to have understood: ships are waiting the nightfall before leaving harbours.\n\nIf you don't see anything over the sea, fly a bit inland. You may fall on fluvial barges or on a truck convoy...\n\nBeware of the Flak and of a reaction from the Luftwaffe. Do not stay over Holland more than 10 minutes or you will certainly be intercepted. Their new Focke Wulf fighters would make short work of your Hurricanes!\n\nFlying altitude: as low as possible.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-IIc - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
