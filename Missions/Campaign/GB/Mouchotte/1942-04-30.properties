Description April 30th, 1942 - 07:10 PM.\nSweep.\n\n"May 1st\nI have already made eleven sweeps over France. Three yesterday during the day. No success whatever. Losses young Hauchemaille and Waillier."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nA B-25 bomber raid is planned on the Abbeville airfield this morning. JG-2 units are settling there. We do think that this raid will set a massive reaction from the Luftwaffe: they can't afford to loose their bases.\n\nNo. 340 Squadron will make a sweep above the coast, 10 minutes before the bomber fly, for opening them the way. Do not let the Luftwaffe slip through your fingers, bombers are counting on you!\n\nFlying altitude: 23,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: SpitMkVb_Garozelis1, marking off.
