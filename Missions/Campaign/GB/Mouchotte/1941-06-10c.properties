Description June 10th, 1941, 11:30 PM.\nNight patrol.\n\n"June 10.\nIt is full moon. I have been up the last two nights, but the Boche is scarce. Last night was so light we could see almost as well as by daylight!"\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nWhat did you say? Huns are very rare? Do you really think that you are sent flying for nothing, just for adding a few night flight hours to your logbook?\n\nReally, Huns are there, trying to send mines in our estuaries. Go on, there is a job to do! This night is very clear, this is ideal for us. We shall talk tomorrow about your demand to be transferred to the 601 squadron. I do think that this is not a good idea. Do you know that they will very soon leave their combat zone, and relieve us? We should not hang about, training here!\n\nFlying altitude: 3,000 feet.\n\nGood luck and open your eyes!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.\n
