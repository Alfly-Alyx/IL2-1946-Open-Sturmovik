       Short Gunnery training\n
       Description August 5th, 1940 - 11:00 AM.\nGunnery Training.\n\nToday, you begin your gunnery training, by shooting your bursts on ground targets. Our firing range is located at the North of this base. Some wooden planes are placed there, and we use it as targets for training. To spot it more easily from a plane, white painting surrounds this area.\n\nTake off, follow the twin motor plane that will lead you to the firing range, spend your ammo on the targets, taking care that all you bullets are going inside the range and fly back to the base. We shall take a car to see your results as soon as you will be back here.\n \nGood luck.\n\nSkin: J8A-Hector.bmp,\n           marking on.\n
