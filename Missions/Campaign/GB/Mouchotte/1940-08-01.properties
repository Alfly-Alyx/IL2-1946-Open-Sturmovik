       Short Aerobatics\n
       Description August 1st, 1940 - 7:30 hours.\nAerobatics\n\n"We fly every day, morning and evening and waste no time...\nTraining goes on steadily; we have passed today from the little Tiger Moth to the big Hector. We are working at aerobatics on the latter machine."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte\n\nWell Sirs,\n\nToday, you will get in a new plane. She is hardly easier to fly and better for aerobatics. Show us what you can do in that matter. The pilots mastering the aerobatics will get a shorter training program, for we are short of fighter pilots to face the German aerial attack on the South of England.\n\nGo! She is yours for one hour. You have to show us a break turn on the right and on the left, an Immelmann, a loop, a split-S.\n\nI will watch at your flight from the ground and I will evaluate it. This test will be the last one. \n\nGood luck.\n\nSkin: J8A-Hector.bmp,\n           marking on.\n\nAdditional note:\nThe Hawker Hector is not available in the game. The Gloster Gladiator will take her place.
