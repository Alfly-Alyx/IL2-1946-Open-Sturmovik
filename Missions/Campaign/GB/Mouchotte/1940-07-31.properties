You will make a triangular fly between three airbases. Fly at 300 metres, ground observers will check your passages over the three bases. Fly just over the landing strips, to help them reading your marking.\n\nTake your time to look at this map. Move it slightly to the right to see the three airfields. After taking off, steer 315 to reach the first airfield. You have 20 minutes to fly over it. Then, steer 080 to reach the second airfield. You should fly over it in less than 40 minutes. Then steer 120 to fly back here. You have to be landed back in less than 60 minutes.\n\nAttention, the time is limited, de not dawdle!\n\nGood luck.\n\nSkin: CR-42-Tiger-Moth.bmp,\n           marking on.\n\nAdditional note:\nThe waypoints are not mentioned on the map, only the targets are shown.
