       Short Flight in formation
       Description July 30th, 1940 - 8:15 hours.\nFlight in formation.\n\nGood morning Sirs,\n\nYou know how important the flight in close formation is for the RAF, and in particular for the Fighter Command. We shall do this morning an exercise in the basic formation, a pair. You will fly as the wingman of an instructor. Stay in formation with him, at fifty metres maximum in his four hours (on his right side, behind him, in the direction of the number 4 on a clock). The waypoints of this trip are not mentioned on your map. The instructor knows the itinerary; do not loose the sight on him!\n\nGround observers and the instructor will inspect and mark the way you keep your position. This test is very important for going in a Fighter Training Unit.\n\nGood luck.\n\nSkin: CR-42-Tiger-Moth.bmp,\n           marking on.
