Short Gunnery training on a towed target\n
Description September 25th, 1940 - 9:15 AM\nGunnery training on a towed target.\n\n"They sent us to shoot at a towed target...\nMy shooting was not too bad but, but the joke is that they could not give me a mark: I cut the target in two with one burst."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nGood morning Sirs,\n\nYou are going to make gunnery training on a towed glider. This glider takes the place of the bombers that you will fight soon over London. Do not make stern attacks on this type of target. A rear gunner could not miss you! Train doing beam attacks, so hat you will not damage the towing plane.\n\nWhen you will be landed back, we shall examine your target and see if you hit it. The DC-3 that towed it will be examined too and woe betides you if she is not intact!\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 1940-NN, marking off.
