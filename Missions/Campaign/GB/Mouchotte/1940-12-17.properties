Description December 17th, 1940 - 11:05 AM.\nTransfer to Kenley.\n\n"December 13th.\nSuddenly there arrives a posting order as unexpected as it is secret. Tomorrow morning, we leave for another aerodrome, south of London and nearer to it. It is Kenley, next door to Croydon. We shall know the delights of being bombed even better there.\n\nDecember 17th, 1940.\nWe arrived in Kenley only today. The aerodrome is quite small. Beware of misjudged landings!"\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\n\nThe fog prevented our transfer at the foreseen date; it gave us some quiet time too! The weather is better; we fly today to Kenley. Sirs, to your planes!\n \nFlying altitude: 3,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.\n
