Description June 20th, 1942 - 12:30.\nClose Escort.\n\n"June 20th.\nWe went with twelve Boston bombers in close escort over le Havre."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nYour task is the protection of the rear squadron. Stay behind the bombers and open your eyes.\n\nFlying Altitude: 12,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: SpitMkVb_Garozelis1.bmp, marking off.\n\n----- WARNING -----\n------- Airstart -------\n\n \n\nHistorical notes:\n"But what makes me furious today is to see how clumsily the bombers have missed the target...\nObviously beginners, completely  bewildered by ack-ack.\nComing in over Deauville, they swung to port too soon to attack le Havre from west to east and arrived on the target at the end of their turn, still diving. Deplorable positioning...\n\nThe results wrung a cry of indignation from me. A great part of the bombs fell like a stream of beads right along the principal artery of the city."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n
