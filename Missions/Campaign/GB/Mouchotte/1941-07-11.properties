Description July 11th, 1941, 5:15 PM.\nSearching St\u00E9phane.\n\n\nHey Rony!\n\nSt\u00E9phane is missing! He got an engine failure too. The control just told us that he crash-landed on a beach.\n\nHe must be located with much accuracy, his cockpit was covered by oil, he did not see anything around and we just know an approximate position. \n\nTake off immediately and find him, around the place mentioned on the map.\n\n\nFlying altitude: 300 feet.\n\nOpen your eyes!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.\n\n\nHistorical note\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte found St\u00E9phane's plane. St\u00E9phane was a young Canadian pilot, and for Mouchotte, he was another friend. In the accident, he was slightly injured on the face, but he could not escape from his machine. He drowned into 2 feet water depth.
