Short Transfer to Northolt\n
Description October 10th, 1940, 10:00 AM\nTransfer to Northolt.\n\n"I thought we should be staying permanently in this circle of good English friends but we are leaving for England. Will it be to a fighting squadron at Last? I don't think so, for the aerodrome is near Glasgow, in Scotland, which the Germans hardly ever visit. They have given us one detail: the squadron to which we are posted is one of the most glorious in the R.A.F., with ninety-seven victories to its credits, decorated with rarely awarded DFC. Unfortunately it seems that the unit has been decimated and has only three pilots left, resting at Prestwick...\n\nOctober.8th.\nAt last, we are leaving for London with the whole squadron. Perhaps in a few days, I will have my duel. At last I shall be able to try to avenge my mother from all the misery she is suffering. Sometimes, I have bloodthirsty impulses which astonish me...\n\nOctober 10th.\nWe took off southward, sixteen planes. Shocking weather, very low cloud, thick mist in places. But it was absolutely necessary to go. We are replacing a squadron of tired Poles, who are taking our place at Prestwick."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nWell, we take off immediately. The weather is not ideal, with these clouds at low altitude, but the transfer cannot be postponed. Less skilled pilots just have to follow their leaders to be guided to our new base.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
