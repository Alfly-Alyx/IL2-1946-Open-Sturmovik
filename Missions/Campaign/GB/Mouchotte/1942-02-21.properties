Description February 21st, 1942 - 06:45 AM.\nWeather reconnaissance.\n\n\n"Dubious weather this morning. I hesitated over letting my pilots go up; very low white clouds. I decided to see what it was like for myself. Once in the air, I thought it was very bad. A ridiculous curiosity made me want to go through the cloud..."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nIt was not a good idea. The radio just called, for the weather on the ground is as bad as possible: ceiling at 200 feet, visibility of 500 metres.\n\nYou are at 12,000 feet, just above the landing strip, dazzled by the sun and on a wonderful cloud sea. It is time to discover the darker side of the clouds and to come back home...\n\nHave a good fly back!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 1940-NN, marking off.
