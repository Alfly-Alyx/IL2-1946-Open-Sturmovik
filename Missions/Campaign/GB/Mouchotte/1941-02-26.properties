Short Squadron Leader Holmwood is missing!\n
Description February 26th, 1941 - 5:35 PM.\nSquadron Leader Holmwood is missing!\n\n"February 26th.\nA sad reckoning today. One plane on its nose in a field. Pilot safe. Another, Forley Norris, shot down. He bailed out and woke up in hospital. Our Squadron Leader, Holmwood, was hit and bailed out...\nI have this moment learned that Holmwood bailed out from his burning plane. His parachute caught fire and he hits the ground from 7,000 metres.\n\nI did not take part in the operation, having run short of petrol in the morning and had engine trouble for half the day on an emergency aerodrome."\n\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nWell Sir, your aircraft is refuelled, you are cleared for joining back Kenley.\nHurry-up, there is a great need of all the available pilots. I'm afraid that the news that you willl get there are not very good.\n\nTake care about some Huns that may hang around. At low altitude, it's difficult to spot them.\n\nFlying altitude: 1,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-IIb - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.\n\nAdditional remark:\nFor taking off from this base, a control key must be defined for "toggle chocks", otherwise the plane shall stay stuck on the landing strip.\n
