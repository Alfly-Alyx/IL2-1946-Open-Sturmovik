Description April 21st, 1941 - 9:00 AM\nTransfer to Valley.\n\n"April 17th.\nA grim order to the effect that the squadron is leaving the defence of London to devote itself to that on the Welsh coast, protecting convoys in particular. We shall fly at a lower altitudes, which does not displease me. Unfortunately, when we change over we shall have to surrender our beautiful Hurricane II to the pilots who take our place and to ride once more the ancient war horses that pant after the bombers... We shall also be flying a lot at night. Those with cat's eyes are lucky!\n\nApril 21st.\nWe took off at nine o' clock. The whole squadron."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nFlying altitude: 3,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off. \n\nAdditional remark:\nFor taking off from this base, a control key must be defined for "toggle chocks", otherwise the plane shall stay stuck on the landing strip.
