Name 1942-07-30.
Short Low altitude sweep.
Description July 30th, 1942 - 5:45 PM.\nLow altitude sweep.\n\n" July 30th.\nTwo sweeps today. Both quite deep, into France: Saint Omer, the first, went off without bother. The second seemed a bit dangerous, as the ceiling was 5,000 feet and there was no protection from altitude."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nWell, Sirs!\n\nFor several months, we are trying to weaken Luftwaffe, launching many sweeps over France, but Germans take off only against bombers. That is why, today, No. 340 Squadron will behave like bombers, heavily weighted of bombs: flying at low altitude and at low speed.\n\nYou will look like a bomber unit on German Radar screens, a Hurri-bomber raid that is lacking an escort. Be sure of the German attack on it, and reply by shooting down a lot of bandits.\n\nFlying Altitude: 5,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: SpitMkVb_Garozelis1.bmp, marking off.
