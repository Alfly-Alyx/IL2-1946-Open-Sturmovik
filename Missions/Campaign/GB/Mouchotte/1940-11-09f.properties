Short Second ascent, in the morning
Description October 9th, 1940, 11:15 AM.\nSecond ascent, in the morning.\n\nEarly in this morning, a German bomber took photographs of a convoy, transiting in Dover. The ships will probably be attacked but the time from the alarm to the attack will probably be very short. We have to set a fighter umbrella over the arbour all day long. Our turn takes place from 11:30 to noon.\n\n\nFlying altitude: 20,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
