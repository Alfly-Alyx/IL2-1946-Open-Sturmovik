Description March 04th, 1941 - 9:30 AM.\nPatrol at 34,000 feet\n\n"March 4th.\nUntil Fortley Norris recovers from his parachute jump, I am appointed leader of B Flight. In the air I am therefore responsible for six planes. An honour rather than a reward."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nYesterday, the German bomber-fighters attacked London again, in the daylight.\nThey are using a simple tactic: approaching at the sea level, climbing when passing the shore, attack of London at high altitude and immediate return to avoid being short of fuel.\nHuns prefer to get less accurate bombing and to maintain these harassing attacks.\n\nWe take off immediately for a patrol at very high altitude.\n\nFlying altitude: 34,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-IIb - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off. \n\nAdditional remark:\nFor taking off from this base, a control key must be defined for "toggle chocks", otherwise the plane shall stay stuck on the landing strip.\n
