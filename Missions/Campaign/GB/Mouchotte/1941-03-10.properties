Immediate take off for all the available aircrafts. Huns are reported almost everywhere on the sector, at high altitude.\n\nYour usual plane is being repaired. You fly this old "KW-E", which is available. It's better than nothing.\n\nFlying altitude: 30,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off. \n\nAdditional remark:\nFor taking off from this base, a control key must be defined for "toggle chocks", otherwise the plane shall stay stuck on the landing strip.\n
