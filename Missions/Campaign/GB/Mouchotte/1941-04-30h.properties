Short Find the convoy
Description April 30th, 1941 - 8:30 AM\nFind the convoy.\n\n"April 30.\nThe monotonous job will be devoid of all interest, the Boche being totally...\nI have decided to send in my resignation tomorrow to the Squadron Leader and apply to be posted back to what I call a fighting unit...\nWe do nothing but protect convoys. We fly in pairs; I have got Charles in my flight, so we always fly together...\n\nThis morning visibility was nil, or very nearly. We literally shaved the waves, flying right out to sea without being able to see 200 metres ahead. It was a miracle that after a quarter-of an hour's flying strait through a grey cotton mist, we suddenly saw the outlines of ships rising before us."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nWell Sirs!\n\nThe weather is far from ideal, but we have to maintain the protection patrols over the convoys. Do not believe that this job is useless! If you see any plane with several motors, shoot it down or at least through it away from the ships. If you see a periscope or a submarine, fire at it with your machine guns to show its position to the escort.\n\nTo find the convoy, steer 300 from just above the base.\n\nFlying altitude: 200 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
