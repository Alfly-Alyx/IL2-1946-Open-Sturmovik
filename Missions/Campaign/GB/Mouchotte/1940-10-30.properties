Name 1940-10-30
Short Defensive Patrol\n
Description October 30th, 1940, 6:15 AM.\nDefensive Patrol.\n\nThe German tactic changes again. Disheartened by heavy losses in day bombing, they are now attacking by fighter-bombers, more rapid, and our operating centres have difficulties to send us take off instructions in right time for the interceptions. Fortunately, the light bomb load of the Messerschmitt 109 limits the damages on the ground but, for once, our defensive system is put on the spot. The speed is becoming the key for the efficiency. \n\nA new raid is approaching, hurry up!\n\nFlying altitude: 30,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
