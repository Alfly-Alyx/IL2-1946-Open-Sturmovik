Short Sweeps
Description May 10th, 1942 - 05:10 PM.\nSweeps. \n\n"May 10th.\nSweeps continue on the same scale. We invade the sky of France from early in the morning to very late in the evening. The bombers we escort are pounding the minefields and ports in the north, from Ostend to Cherbourg. Yesterday evening, it was Dieppe; today, Hasbrouck and Dixmude. And this is just beginning, the rhythm is stepping up. The American Factories are turning out 5,000 planes a month. Not counting English and Russian aircrafts. The Boche is certainly going to get in the neck."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nWell Sirs!\nAnother sweep in planned late in this afternoon, over Dixmude. No. 174, 122 and 303 squadrons shall compose the close escort. You shall patrol over the sector ten minutes before the "big boys" arrival, so that the Luftwaffe will not be able to take a favourable position for attacking the bombers.\n \nFlying Altitude: 16,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: SpitMkVb_Garozelis1.bmp, marking off.
