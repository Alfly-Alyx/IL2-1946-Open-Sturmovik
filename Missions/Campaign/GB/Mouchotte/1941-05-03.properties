Short The death of Charles Gu\u00E9rin 
Description May 3rd, 1941, 3:15PM.\nThe death of Charles Gu\u00E9rin.\n\nSirs!\n\nAnother convoy is approaching from the West. You will protect it at 4,000 feet, from 3:30 to 4:00. This kind of job makes routine missions, doesn't it?\n\nAS usual, you will fly it with Charles, but this time, he will be the patrol leader.\n\nFlying altitude: 4,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off. \n\nHistorical notes:\n\n"May 10.\nIt happened on Saturday at 3.45 p.m., and now that several days have passed, I can write about the frightful catastrophe which cost my best friend, Charles Gu\u00E9rin, his life. On patrol over a convoy, some fifty miles out to seas,... I suddenly saw the fatal white cloud which indicates escaping glycol stream from his machine...\n\nHe was going to try and ditch near the convoy...\n\nA great white cloud of white smoke completely enveloped the plane and must have blinded Charles...\nAlas, when we were at 50 feet, the most unforeseeable thing happened... He straightened his plane out, thinking he was at sea level, then with a savage swift movement, the plane lurched to starboard, skimmed the sea, turned over and vanished in less than a second...\n\nI went back alone. My companion throughout the war, who left France with me, who escaped from Algeria with me, my brother-in-arms with his great hope for the future; has left me for ever."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.
