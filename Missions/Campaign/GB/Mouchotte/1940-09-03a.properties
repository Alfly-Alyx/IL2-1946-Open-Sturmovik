I was the victor in a combat with one of my comrades. I am getting the hang of the Hurricane"\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nYou are going top make a combat exercise against another Hurricane, flown by a fellow. Both two pilots take off now, and have to fight each other with the gun-camera. The pilot who gets the other one longer in his gun-sight wins.\n\nGood luck and take care about collisions!\n\nSkin: Hurri_trainer.bmp,\n           marking on.\n\nAdditional note:\nIn the game, I.A. planes cannot fight using the gun-cam. So, the other Hurricane will be armed! Yours not, you would not like to get your first victory against a British plane, would you?
