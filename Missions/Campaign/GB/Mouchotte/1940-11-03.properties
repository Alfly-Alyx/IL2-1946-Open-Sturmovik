Short Patrol over Dover\n
Description November 3rd, 1940, 7:00 AM.\nPatrol over Dover.\n\n"November 03rd.\nThis morning, patrolling towards Dover, we flew low over London, which for once was not hidden by mist. I could not help thinking of the hundreds, the thousands of wounds this valiant city receives every night. Every night bombs begin to rain down almost everywhere from seven o'clock onwards.\nWhile I was flying over London, I sought fallen landmarks, but I did not see any. I noticed Westminster intact. There was famous London Bridge, which I saw for the first time. Dense traffic on the Thames. But we were going fast. We shaved the balloons. Now we were over the estuary. The altitude and the cloud brought me back to other realities."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nYesterday was not a good day. We were obliged to fly down away as soon as the Germans covered us. But even these missions are not useless! Another raid is gathering in France. We take off to Dover.\n\nFlying altitude: 16,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.\n
