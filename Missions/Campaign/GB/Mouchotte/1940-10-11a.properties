Description October 11th, 1940, 7:02 AM\nFirst fighting mission.\n\n"October 11th.\nMy first fighting mission: an event. Greatly excited."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nGood morning Sirs,\n\nThe radiolocation operators just detected an enemy formation gathering over the Straits of Dover. They will probably try and attack London again. Our mission is simple: to prevent it. Do not forget that bombers are your main targets. Spitfire squadrons will deal with enemy fighters.\n\nThe formation today will be composed two sections of three aircrafts. Each section shall be followed by a "weaver", making zigzags over it to look out at the rear side.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
