Short Patrol by very bad weather.\n
Description August 7th, 1941 - 4:05 PM.\nPatrol by very bad weather.\n\n"August 7\nPatrol over convoy 50 miles out at sea. Very bad weather."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nI do know the weather is almost not flyable... But an unidentified submarine was just signalled by a Coastal Command Blenheim. Nobody knows what it can be doing so close to our coasts! \n\nThe Blenheim did attack and it may have damaged the submarine. The Royal Navy asks us to retrieve and localise the enemy with some accuracy. The reception was hot for the Blenheim and we jus got an approximate position...\n\nYou take off alone. No way for putting a young pilot in that mesh!\n\nFlying altitude: at sea level\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
