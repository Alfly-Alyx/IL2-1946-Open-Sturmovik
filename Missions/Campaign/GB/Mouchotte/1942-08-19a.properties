Description August 19th, 1942 - 4:30 AM.\nProtection Mission.\n\n"June 30th\nAnniversary of my escape to Gibraltar. Two years. This morning, at last, the great news. We shall attempt the invasion tomorrow. Tomorrow, at several points of the French coast, a combination of air, sea and land attacks will be let loose on a probably enormous scale...\n\nJuly 1st.\nThe bad weather had disappointed all hopes. No one has taken off...\n\nJuly 4th.\nThree days of mist and rain. Which has not prevented three other squadrons installing themselves here. That brings the number of squadrons on the Tangmere aerodromes to eighteen...\n\nMr. Anthony Eden and his wife and Sir Archibald Sinclair and his wife have been to visit us... As he left me, the Minister very kindly whispered in my ear, 'And good luck on the operation, Mouchotte!'...\n\nJuly 7th.\nA day of mourning here. This morning, squadrons taking off from the Tangmere aerodromes woke us with their heavy drone. 'Something's going on without us', we thought. Ah, yes, something was going on indeed: the anticipated offensive has been postponed...\n\nJuly 8th.\nThe group captain called me urgently to his office this morning...\n'It was nothing less than an attempt at invading the continent. A very calm sea and cloudless sky are indispensable conditions. But don't give up hope, it will be soon...'\n\nAugust 8th.\nShall we make the invasion one day? The Russians are in retreat, the Caucasus is partly invaded...\n\nAugust 18th.\nAt last! The attack! Tomorrow, at dawn, the first phase of the biggest Allied offensive of the war opens...\nAs far as we are concerned, we had just got the details of the operation which is to take part in the Dieppe sector, the outline of which seems to be an attack of the town with a withdrawal of the troops engaged at 11 a.m. ...\nWe are to take off before dawn, arrive over the port five minutes before the ships are alongside... We are thus to give them cover... Hundreds of planes of all kinds with various missions will be on the party. What a free fight there is going to be! Good luck, Ren\u00E9 my boy, and to bed."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nAugust 19th, 1942, 3:45 a.m.\n\n"Time to get up, Sir!"\nThe orderly, who just awoke you, ticks your name off on his list, and walks to another bed.\n\nJust the time to dress and to take a strong breakfast, we have to take off in 45 minutes. The operation was explained us yesterday.\n\nFlying Altitude: 5,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: SpitMkVb_GarozelisA.bmp, marking off.\n
