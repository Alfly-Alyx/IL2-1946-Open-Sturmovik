Description June 6th, 1941, 7:15 AM.\nWeather reconnaissance.\n\n"June 05\nPoor visibility this morning. I plunge into the cloud as soon as I had taken off...\nThey had sent me up to see what the weather was like!"\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nThe weather is not very fine and a skilled pilot is required to measure the cloud coat. Are you volunteer? \n\nWell. So, you take off and fly through these clouds. Arrived above, read your altitude and tell it us by the radio. We shall know if sending young pilots is possible today.\n\nIf you can, you may have a look far inside the fjord. An escort ship reported a Ju-88 early this morning. Perhaps! German may try to take advantage of the clouds to visit us... Don't shoot at anything, it would not be the first time that the Royal Navy takes a Blenheim or a Catalina for a Junker!\n\nFlying altitude:\nAbove the clouds, then skimming the waves.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.
