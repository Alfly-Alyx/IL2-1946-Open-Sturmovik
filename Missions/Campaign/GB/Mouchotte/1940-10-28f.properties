One day, perhaps?"\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nStop your daydream, a "jabo"(German fighter-bombers) just finished over Dover, damaging a cargo ship. But the AA guns shot down an assailant, who is taking a bath in the Channel. The Air Sae Rescue motorboats are trying to pick him out. It's up to you to find him, and to protect our sides against any German operation to take this pilot back to their shores.\n\nImmediate take off.\n\nFlying altitude: 500 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-I - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off.\n
