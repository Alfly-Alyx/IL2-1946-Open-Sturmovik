Short Protection of a naval convoy
Description March 15th, 1941 - 12:30 AM\nProtection of a naval convoy.\n\n"15 mars.\nOur poor 'Grand P\u00E8re' funeral was this morning. My room is appallingly sad now. We bore him to the cemetery, broken hearted... Goodbye, Bouqui.\nOn March 10th, Bouquillard and I were commissioned as sous-lieutenants by General de Gaulle. We new nothing about it...\nToday March 15, the date of our comrade's burial, young Laffont shots down his second Boche...\nIt is magnificent that he should have been successful on a day like today, but you are not sufficiently avenged yet, Bouqui."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte.\n\nWell Sirs!\nThis was a very sad ceremony, so far from home!\n\nThe job goes on, and it is the best way to prevent depression.\nYou plane is repaired. A British convoy is coming in the Channel, approaching the Arbour. It should have arrived by night but it was forced to zigzag for submarine presence signalled. A continuous fighter umbrella must be maintained on it.\n\nFlying altitude: 3,000 feet.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: Hurricane Mk-IIb - 615 Sq.bmp, marking off. \n\nAdditional remark:\nFor taking off from this base, a control key must be defined for "toggle chocks", otherwise the plane shall stay stuck on the landing strip.
