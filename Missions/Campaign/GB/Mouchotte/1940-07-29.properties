Description July 29th, 1940 - 10h 30.\nFirst flight on Tiger Moth\n\n"We got here last night, and as from this morning, we fly."\nRen\u00E9 Mouchotte\n\nWell Sirs,\nI am Flight Lieutenant Brian West. I have to evaluate your pilot capabilities. All of you will fly a trip, with an instructor at the observer place. For all, the program is the same:\nTake off, turn starboard, turn backboard, climb at 1000 metres, make a loop, go in spin, stop the spin and land.\n\nIf you do want to have an interesting career in the RAF, you must get the mention "above average." And for that do not frighten me! \n\nSkin: CR-42-Tiger-Moth.bmp,\n           marking on.
