Description 112 Squadron\n=========\u00AC\n7 June 1942\n=========\u00AC\nTime: 10:25\n=========\u00AC\n\nFritz has pushed up further to El Adhem and Knightsbridge despite our counter-attacks, yet thanks to the gallant French at Bir Hacheim we're still in the fight.\n\nApparently The Auk thinks that we in the Desert Air Force are doing a cracking job, so let's keep the tempo going so as not to disappoint him.  South African armoured car patrols have reported enemy armour moving up the tracks to El Adhem in the sector indicated.  You will drop some eggs on them so as to discourage them from going any further.\n\nLast one back's a cissy.\n\n=================\u00AC\nWeather: Hazy\n=================\u00AC\nArmament: 1 x 500lb.
