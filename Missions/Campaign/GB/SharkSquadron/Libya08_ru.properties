Description 112 Squadron\n=========\u00AC\n29 May 1942\n=========\u00AC\nTime: 11:20\n=========\u00AC\n\nThe Frenchies of 1st Free Brigade are holding out superbly against the Ariete Division's assault on Bir Hacheim.  Of course, we can't just stand back and admire them, as much as we'd like to do so.\n\nThey're coming under considerable air assault, which shows just how crucial their position is - it's smack in the way of the enemy panzers' supply lines.  You're on a four plane sweep over the position - if you see bandits, attack them regardless of personal consequences.\n\n=================\u00AC\nWeather: Blind\n=================\u00AC\nArmament: N/A\n=================\u00AC\n
