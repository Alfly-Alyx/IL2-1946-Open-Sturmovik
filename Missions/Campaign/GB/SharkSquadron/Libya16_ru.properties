Description 112 Squadron\n=========\u00AC\n20 June 1942\n=========\u00AC\nTime: 13:00\n=========\u00AC\n\nRight chaps, it's off to Tobruk for our last mission in support of the defences there.  Hit the armour of 15th Panzer Division and then return home.  It looks like the Hun has given us a pasting in this sector, so we'll be moving back into Egypt, and hoping that the South Africans can hold out until we get our act together sufficiently to return.\n\nBitter days indeed, but if there's one thing we've learnt from this desert war, the pendulum can always swing our way again....\n\n=================\u00AC\nWeather: Cloudy\n=================\u00AC\nArmament: 1 x 1000lb HE\n=================\u00AC\n
