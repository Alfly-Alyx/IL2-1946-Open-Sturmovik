Description 112 Squadron\n=========\u00AC\n20 May 1942\n=========\u00AC\nTime: 16:10\n=========\u00AC\n\nWire has come through from Malta informing us of inbound transports heading to Derna.  Possibly ground personnel for the build up of air units that our signals interception has already noted.\n\nWe've plotted an interception route to their expected position, so now it's up to you boys to carry out the job.  Keep your eye out for protective fighters that will no doubt be sent out to bring them in.  Otherwise, get stuck in and fill your boots.\n\n=================\u00AC\nWeather: Cloudy\n=================\u00AC\nArmament: N/A\n=================\u00AC\n\n
