Description 112 Squadron\n=========\u00AC\n26 May 1942\n=========\u00AC\nTime: 15:40\n=========\u00AC\n\nGather round now chaps, it looks like the Desert Fox is making his move.  1st South Africans are reporting a direct assault on their Gazala Line position.  It looks like Rommel is shoving the Eyetie XXI Corps into the line first, no doubt to see how much lead we can throw back before he chucks his own boys in.\n\nThere's some armoured support been given to this assault, and that's where we come in.  You know what Air Marshal Tedder wants us to do - help out the pongos - so we're going to hit the Jerry tanks with 500-pounders.  These bombs are deucedly expensive, so I want a full written explanation if you all miss.\n\nWell, don't just sit there staring at me - go to your planes!\n\n=================\u00AC\nWeather: Cloudy\n=================\u00AC\nArmament: 1 x 500lb.
