Description 112 Squadron\n=========\u00AC\n12 June 1942\n=========\u00AC\nTime: 07:10\n=========\u00AC\n\nRight, the fall of Bir Hacheim has left the Gazala Line untenable, so Eigth Army is pulling back.  It looks like we're responding to the German initiative with the usual muddle and buggeration.\n\nSome of the stragglers at Qurdabah are coming under air attack.  Nip over there and have a quick shufti, before joining the rest of the squadron at our temporary stop-over at Burdiyah.  If we don't recover our poise soon, it'll be next stop Egypt....\n\n=================\u00AC\nWeather: Cloudy\n=================\u00AC\nArmament: N/A\n=================\u00AC\n
