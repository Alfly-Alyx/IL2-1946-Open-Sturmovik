Name Battle for Admin Box 07
Short February 5, 1944\nAdmin Box\n
Description The British used new battle tactics this time around.  Instead of withdrawing and retreating, the troops would form defensive boxes and hold their ground.  \n\nThe main box became known as the Admin Box.  It is large flat piece of land located in the Sinzweya basin and surrounded by small hills.  Headquarters and supply dumps are located around a small hill in its center.  Ngakyedauk Pass, nicknamed Okie-doke Pass, is at the southern end of the box and this is the supply route until it's severed by the Japanese.  After being cut off, the Admin Box continued to survive with supplies being airlifted by cargo planes.  \n\nThe Japanese had overlooked the RAF's strength and its ability to supply ground troops by air which was something the Japanese lacked.  Air power continued to play a major role throughout the Burma campaign.\n\nFebruary 5, 1944\nTime:  0930  Weather:  Clear\n\nMission:\nAnother 70 Ki-43s are reported heading toward Taung Bazar and the Admin Box.  Sixteen Spitfires of 136 and 607 Squadrons will intercept.\n\n
