Name Battle for Admin Box 12
Short February 22, 1944\nAkyab Island\n
Description The siege of the Admin Box was finally broken at the end of February.  Gallant but suicidal attacks by the Japanese soldiers failed to collapse the Box.  In the end the Japanese units were understrength, tired, and worn out.  Allied tactics and weapons proved too strong.  \n\nThe Allies were now on the offensive again in the Arakan.  British and Indian troops continued to battle in the Maungdaw and Buthidaung area while the West African Division moved down the Kaladan Valley.  The Japanese were overpowered but still put up a strong fight in the Arakan for several more months.\n\nSome British leaders consider the Battle of the Admin Box to be the turning point in their war against Japan.  Although the scope of the Arakan battlefield was limited, the Japanese left 5000 dead on the field.  British and Indian soldiers had proved that they could defeat the vaunted Japanese army and this gave a big boost to morale.\n\n607 Sqn soon moved to George airstrip on the coast and later moved to Imphal where they upgraded with the Spitfire MkVIII.\n\nFebruary 22, 1944\nTime:  1650  Weather:  Clear\n\nMission:\nEight Spitfires of 607 Sqn will patrol over Akyab Island at 20,000 ft. (6000m).\n\nLast mission\n
