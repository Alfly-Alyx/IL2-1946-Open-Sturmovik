Name Battle for the Admin Box
Description A 12-mission campaign with the RAF 607 Squadron in the Battle of the Admin Box, January - March 1944, flying the Spitfire MkVc.\n\nBackground:\nThe allies First Arakan Offensive in the early months of 1943 ended in disaster.  The front line remained at Maungdaw and Buthidaung in the Arakan and followed a line up to Kalemyo.  By December the Japanese had built up their forces to be able to start  their own offensive...an attack into India to take Chittagong.  But, this attack was merely a diversion for a much larger offensive to take place further north, an attempt to take Imphal.\n\nThis Japanese attack in the Arakan was pre-empted by an allied offensive, the Second Arakan Offensive, to keep the Japanese off-balance.  The two opposing forces collided in the area around Maungdaw and Buthidaung resulting in fierce and heavy fighting.\n\nEarly on, the JAAF tried to establish air superiority over the battlefield with fighter sweeps of up to 100 planes.  The RAF countered with its new Spitfire squadrons, some with the Mk VIII and some, like 607 Sqn, with the older Mk Vc.\n\ncampaign created by CzechTexan
