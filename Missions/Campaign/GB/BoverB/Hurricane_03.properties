Description September 8th 1939 First "combat".\nTwo days ago we lost our first pilot in the war due to a tragic friendly fire incident.\nToday will be the first time a Hurricane will go aloft and fire its guns at a legitimate target.\nWord has just come in that a barrage balloon has slipped its mooring cables in Portsmouth Harbor and is beginning to drift with the wind towards land.\nThe balloon with its cable dragging presents a danger to our own aircraft and also to persons and property on the ground.\nYou will be taking off alone to destroy the balloon before it reaches shore. Take off and head due south, climbing to 1200m.\nOnce you're over the water, veer south-southwest and look for the gasbag.\nShoot it down and return home.\nKeep clear of the cable mate!\n\n\n*SKIN* Hurri.bmp\nMarkings ON.\n
