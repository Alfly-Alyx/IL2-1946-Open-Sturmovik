Name October 21st 1940 Late afternoon.
Short October 21st 1940.  Late afternoon. You will head back to Church Fenton earlier than expected...\n
Description October 21st, 1940.   Late afternoon. You won't get the short rest you were hoping for today. Soon after arriving at Ventnor this morning, you were informed that your services would be needed to provide escort to a RAF Blenheim that will be leaving at 17.00 with an officer, that has what is believed to be an acute case of appendicitis.\nThere are no available hospital facilities on the island so he will need to be evacuated  directly back to the mainland.\n\nUnfortunately, you will be the lone escort. There are no other fighters here, but you will be met by a vic of Hurricanes as you near the coast.\nGood luck up there.\nHopefully you'll have a nice quiet ride and spend the night in your own bed.\n
