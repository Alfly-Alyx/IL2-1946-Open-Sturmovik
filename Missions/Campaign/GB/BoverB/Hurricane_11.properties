He and his mates, while successful in the combat, did get shot up pretty badly by the 109s and ended up crash landing their damaged Hurricanes on French soil after the engagement.\nFor the evening tour along the frontier, you will be joined by two French M.S. 406s.\nGerman air activity has been noted in your area so keep on your toes and be prepared for action if it comes.\n
