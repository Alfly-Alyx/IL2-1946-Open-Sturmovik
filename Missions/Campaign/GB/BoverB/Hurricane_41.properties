Name October 21st, 1940
Short October 21st 1940. Maritime recce patrol and landing at Ventnor radar station.\n
Description October 21st, 1940.  This morning you'll be out on a maritime recce patrol. The German Navy has been making runs through the Channel under cover of darkness.\n\nAfter takeoff, head south to the Channel and climb to a patrol altitude of 1500m.     \n\nLast night a Kriegsmarine warship managed to sneak through the Straits of Dover and is heading for open water. If you see this ship, you will need to go down low to get a good photograph. Drop down to wave top height at full speed and make a very low level pass over the ship to get detailed photos of the structure of the vessel. We think there might be a new kind of coastal patrol vessel the Germans are employing and we'll need good detailed photos. \n\nAfter your patrol, you will land at the small field near the radar station on Ventnor. There you'll refuel, spend the night and return to Church Fenton tomorrow.\n
