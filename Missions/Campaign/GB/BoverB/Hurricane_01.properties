Description August 20th 1939 Tour of the area.\nToday you'll be flying your new Hurricane for the first time.\nNo doubt it will be quite a different bird to the Gladiator's you're used to.\nWe don't want too much from you today, just take off, climb to 3000 metres, fly the length of the Isle Of Wight, and return home passing around the red buoy.\nI'm sure you'll be impressed by the speed this plane is capable of.\nYou can either use this flight to test the aerobatic capabilities of the Hurricane or you could attempt to break the record for this circuit.\nThe time to beat is 29 minutes from take-off to landing.\nAlthough it would be nice to witness a new record, don't take any unneccesary risks.\n\n\n*SKIN* Hurri_trainer.bmp\nMarkings ON.\n
