Name September 28th 1940
Short September 28th 1940 Fly a routine low level patrol over the Channel\n\n
Description September 28th 1940 This morning you will fly a low level patrol over the Channel in search of downed pilots. Both our own and the Germans.\nThe Luftwaffe has been operating a rescue service called the Seenotdienst.\nThey have anchored rafts out in the Channel, with water and provisions for their pilots who might not make it back all the way to France.\nThe Seenotdienst has also used float planes to go searching for downed flyers. Many of them have been painted white with red crosses in hope that they would not be attacked while on their mission of mercy.\nThis is war though, and any pilot picked up out of the drink will certainly be back in the air and causing us trouble. Therefore, we have decided to attack any and all Luftwaffe rescue planes we might encounter on our flights.\nIf you do encounter one of these planes, dont hesitate to shoot it down.\nRemember, the enemy pilot that's saved might be the one to take your life tomorrow...\n
