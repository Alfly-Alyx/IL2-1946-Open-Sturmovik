Name July 10th 1940
Short July 10th 1940 Defend a convoy off the coast of Manston from an attack by German bombers.\n
Description July 10th 1940. 85 Squadron, after being based with the BEF in France throughout the "Phony War" and the Blitzkrieg, has been brought back to England following the fall of France.\n85 Squadron is part of Fighter Command Group 11 and your unit has been stationed in Debden since late May. \nThis morning you have been called upon to fly immediately to the rescue of a convoy off the coast of Manston. The Germans have been putting lots of pressure on convoys travelling through the channel. It is believed that there is perhaps only one bomber with a strong fighter escort. Follow your flight path closely after takeoff. You have been carefully routed to go between two belts of barrage balloons and they will be difficult to see with the weather we have today. When you arrive at your cruising altitude of 2500m, fly at top speed to the defence area above the convoy. The Germans will already be well on their way so you will have to be hasty to catch them.You can expect rain throughout your flight this morning. You will have one other vic of experienced pilots to watch your back.\n\n\n*SKIN* HurricaneMkI_85-3-P.bmp\nMarkings OFF.\n
