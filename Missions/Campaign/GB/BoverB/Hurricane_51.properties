Name November 5th 1940
Short November 5th 1940 The end of the Battle of Britain.\n
Description November 5th 1940. You made it through one of the most difficult and dangerous periods of our history.\nThe people of Great Britain owe you and all of your fellow fighter pilots of the RAF a debt of gratitude for your hard work, perseverence and sacrifice in the face of overwhelming odds.\nThe Luftwaffe has suffered a great defeat at your hands.\nThe Germans have lost many experienced pilots and aircraft of all types.\nThe invasion of England has been thwarted. \n\nIt is now time to take stock of the lessons we have learned in the past three months. Units will have a brief moment to re-equip, rest and begin training new pilots to replace those lost in combat.\n\nYour aircraft itself, the Hurricane, is nearing the end of its operational lifetime. It will still serve its country for some time to come but our Spitfire has much more potential for continued development. \n\nYour last mission, before you go on leave and then onto reassignment, is simple.\nYou will fly as escort for a Blenheim from Coastal Command on a routine anti-submarine patrol over the channel.\nWhen you return, two weeks of well deserved rest will await you.\n
