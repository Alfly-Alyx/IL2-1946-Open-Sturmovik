Description September 11th 1940 Another enemy infiltration.\nAlthough we expected a concerted attack against London this evening, we are faced with a large infraction over Hampshire, unless we act fast.\nA large raid is heading towards Fareham, a densley populated town between the cities of Southampton and Portsmouth.\nThree vics are to set off to intercept the attackers.\nStay disciplined out there.\nA synchronised attack will prove far more effective than an all out 'furball' situation.\n
