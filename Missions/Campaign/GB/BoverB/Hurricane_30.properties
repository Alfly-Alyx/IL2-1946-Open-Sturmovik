Description \u0020September 18th, 1940 The tide begins to turn. Three days ago, on Sept 15th, the Luftwaffe lost 36 bombers and 23 fighters for a loss of 163 crews captured or killed. The invasion of Britain, Operation "Sealion", is no longer feasible and Hitler has called off his attempt to take the British Isles. While there are still some large daylight raids with Ju88s and He111s, the bombers have switched to making more night attacks, using the cover of darkness to protect them. You will be called upon to intercept incoming bombers tonight. You will take off alone and do the best you can to try and intercept the nocturnal raiders using moonlight and searchlights to locate the Heinkels. Although you dont have much\ntraining in night operations, we need to put some pilots up in the air. Take off and head East to an altitude of 2300m and begin you search. Good luck. The airfield will be well lit to assist you in coming and going. \n
