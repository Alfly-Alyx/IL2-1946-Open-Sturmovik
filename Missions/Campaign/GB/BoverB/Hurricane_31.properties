Description September 24th 1940 Just under three hours ago Woolston in Southampton was attacked.\nAnother attack is expected.\nWe would prefer not to be caught out this time.\nTake off and fly a circuit around the city of Southampton.\nHopefully you will be able to thwart a second attack on the city.\n\nI'm sure you've all attended the briefings regarding formation flying.\nToday you'll get to try the 'Finger Four' for the first time. Although we haven't been totally convinced of it's merit, I get the impression that, as the Luftwaffe seem to have embraced this technique, we'll be using it more and more as the war progresses.\n\nTwo flights of four are to perform todays sweep then.\n
