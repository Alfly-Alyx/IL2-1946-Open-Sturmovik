Name October 2nd 1940
Short October 2nd 1940 Intercept enemy fighter sweeps.\n
Description October 2nd 1940.   As the days are growing shorter, the Luftwaffe has begun to change its tactics. More bomber missions are waiting until nightfall to cross the Channel. During the day, single Bf109s with one bomb will make the crossing and drop their bombs in the general area of their target. The 109s are coming in very high. Often too high for our Hurricanes to intercept them.\n\nTo counter the new threat, more and more standing fighter patrols need to be maintained to intercept  the small, random groups of 109s and 110s.\n  \nYou will also notice another change since the beginning of October. All of the 'Hurris' in your unit have a broad white identification stripe painted on the side of the fuselage.\n\nToday it seems as if the Germans are leaving the bombers back at home and flying sweeps over England with Bf109s and 110s.\nThe first attack this morning came in just under an hour ago at 09.00. About 30 fighters crossed the coast at Dungeness and flew toward central London. Twelve of the fighters penetrated the Inner Artillery Zone but soon turned around and headed for home.\nRadar reports that a second wave of fighters will soon be crossing the coast.\nYou will find yourself on standing patrol at 3500m to keep an eye out for small groups of German fighters.\nYou will be relieving two Czech pilots of 312 Squadron. They will have enough fuel to stick around for just a few more minutes.\n
