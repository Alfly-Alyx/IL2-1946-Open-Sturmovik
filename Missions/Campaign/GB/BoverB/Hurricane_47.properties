Description October 27th, 1940. During the day today, the Germans made a number of raids into England. The attacks were mainly composed of fighters, but a few bombers were seen. A fairly large force of Ju88s was picked up by radar leaving Cherbourg heading towards the Southampton/Portsmouth area. Our fighters intercepted them before they reached the coast and the Ju88s turned around and headed for home with the loss of one of their number.\nRadar has picked up a small number of unidentified blips that appear to be heading towards our airfield.\nOther bases have reported being attacked this evening at dusk. None of our fighters are active in the area (B-8 on the map) where the radar sightings occured.\nScramble immediately with a vic of Hurricanes and climb to 1500m to intercept the unidentified aircraft.\n
