Name October 15th 1940
Short October 15th 1940. Night fighter operations\n
Description October 15th, 1940.    A clear, moonlit night. More and more the Germans are shifting their attacks to the night time and using new tactics and weapons as well. Intelligence reports that enemy bombers are most likely using some kind of radar device to guide bombers to the target. It is even rumoured that a auto-pilot device on the plane can be "plugged in" to the beam to help guide it to the target.\n\nLarger bombs have been dropped on cities as well. 1000, 1400 and 1800kg bombs have been dropped as have mines large enough to flatten an area the size of Westminster. Special units are also dropping flares and incendiary bombs in civilian neighbourhoods to create fires to guide following bomber streams.\n\nThis evening looks like its going to be especially busy. Incoming raids have been plotted as coming from the French coast, Holland and the Dutch islands. \n\nTake off and head to the coast. You will then proceed east to Portsmouth at an altitude of 3000m. Once you're over the city, do your best to pick out single bombers using the searchlights to help you find targets. The moon should be helpful as well. Set your gun convergence for 150-200m. Close in on the bombers, using darkness to sneak up to close range. Aim for the engines and if you get the engines smoking, save your ammunition and move on to the next plane. With the .303s you can succeed in downing the planes by damaging them.\nIf you score some good hits, they won't make it all the way across the Channel.\n
