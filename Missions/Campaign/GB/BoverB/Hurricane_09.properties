Description December 23rd 1939.  It is two days before Christmas and any hopes of the war being over by this holiday have been lost long ago.\nThis morning you and your wingman will take off and circle to the north of your airfield and climb with full boost to an altitude of 3800m.\nOnce at that altitude you will meet a single Blenheim recon aircraft. Follow the Blenheim to the east and escort it on its photo run.\nBe advised that a number of French M.S. 406 are on patrol this morning along the border to the north and you well might run into them on your flight..\nOff you go now.\nGood luck.\n\n\n*SKIN* HurricaneMkI_85-2-P.bmp\nMarkings OFF.
