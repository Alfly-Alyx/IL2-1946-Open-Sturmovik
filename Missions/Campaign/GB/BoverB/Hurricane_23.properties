Description 15th August 1940 the enemy are stepping up their offensive.\nThis evening you are to be vectored in two vics of three out towards the Isle Of Wight.\nThe enemy are heading this way.\nThe first vic will aim to be around 3000m as they near The Isle Of Wight, the second vic at around 4500m.\n\nWith regard to tactics, I want to read from Fighter Command Tactical Memorandum No 8. The paragraph I'll refer to is headed "THE AIM".\n\nIt states that Britain's ability to continue the war depends on the success of fighters in protecting "vital centres, and especially those concerned with aircraft. It must therefore, be constantly borne in mind that our aim is THE DESTRUCTION OF ENEMY BOMBERS, and that action against enemy fighters is only a means towards this end...Always remember that your objective is the ENEMY BOMBER"\n\nI trust you get the message Gentlemen.\nVic One, go for the bombers. Vic Two, enemy fighters are your target.\n
