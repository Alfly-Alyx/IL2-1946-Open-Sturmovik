Description October 25th 1940. Enemy air activity has been on a much larger scale today after a short period of quiet.\nLuftwaffe kites have been over England almost non stop since first light. The majority of the raids have been centered on London and the Home Counties and have been undertaken by fighter bombers although a few larger craft have been sighted as well. Large formations of 50-100 planes have crossed the coast and then broken into ever smaller groups to disperse and make their attacks.\nThe day is winding down for you after flying a number of sorties. Time to knock off with the approaching darkness, get some rest and let the new Beaufighters take care of the night skies.\n\nSuddenly the alarm siren sounds.\nAlarm!!\n\nGerman fighter bombers are approaching at low level from both the south and south east!\n\n
