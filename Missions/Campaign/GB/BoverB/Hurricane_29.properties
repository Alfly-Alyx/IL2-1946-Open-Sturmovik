Short September 16th 1940 A brief respite. Hunt for incoming recon aircraft.\n
Description \u0020September 16th 1940. The weather has turned a bit worse today and perhaps we'll have a slower day today than yesterday. There have been raids plotted, but many of the incoming bombers have retreated due to weather and strong fighter groups sent up to meet them.\nThere has been the normal morning high altitude recon flights. You and your wingman will go aloft this morning and climb to 4000m as quickly as possible. The incoming aircraft is most likely heading over the Portland docks to photograph damage from yesterdays raid.\n
