Description \u0020October 9th, 1940. There is sad news today among Fighter Command. Yesterday, Sergeant Josef Frantisek of 303 Squadron was killed in a flying accident. He had survived some of the fiercest fighting of the Battle of Britain to become one of the highest scoring aces. Yesterday, upon his return to Northolt, he had a mysterious crash. He was found dead in the wreck but there were no signs of battle damage. We will mourn his passing and try to unravel the unsettling mystery surrounding his crash.\n\nThis evening you will be on standing post again on the watch for hit and run attacks. The attacks have been frequently been low level bombing and strafing runs made by small groups of aircraft often arriving on the coast at dusk.\n\nTake up your standing patrol at 2000m and an approximate speed of 300kph and watch for low level attacks near the radar station at Fairlight.\n\nWe'll have some lighting on the field for you when you get back. \n
