Description October 14th 1940 Poor weather has led to infrequent activity over the last few days.\nAlthough the weather is still poor, it's not so bad as to stop us from getting airborne.\n\nYou have made a sweep of the coastal area between Fareham and Portsmouth and are now heading North West towards Alton.\nOnce you reach the outskirts of Alton, turn East towards Southampton before heading for home.\nDue to the lack of visibility any attacks are likely to be carried out at fairly low altitudes, so keep to around 2000 metres.\n\nShould you encounter the enemy, ensure that you have a distinct advantage before engaging.\nWe can't afford to  lose many more fighters before the next major strike.\n\nWhen you land you will need to speak with your ground crew as it appears that your fuel gauge is faulty. It's reading almost empty although you've only been flying for around ten minutes.\nYour plane does feel rather light too.\nIt probably just needs a good overhaul.\n
