Name Malta Defenders : Operation Aegeus
Description You are the Wing Commander of a wing of Spitfire MkVcs based at Takali, Malta, in spring 1942. \nPrepare yourself and your men for two days of intense air combat surrounding the arrival of relief convoy Aegeus. The German Luftwaffe and Italian Reggia Aeronautica in Sicily will be trying their best to ensure Aegeus fails in its mission : to bring much needed supply to the besieged island.\n\nPlayer Should select the highest rank possible (Group Captain). \n\nThis campaign was designed to be flown with 'full real' settings. Disable icons and minimap icons. Don't forget to turn off 'no instant success' or you'll be stuck in the first mission ! \n\nAltitudes and waypoints are given as a guideline, but you don't have to follow them strictly. The missions may just not play out the same if you stray too far away from them. \n\nGood luck and remember : Per Ardua Ad Astra !
