Name Malta 11 : Wounded wolf
Short Day 2, Takali, 5:30\n\nSeek and destroy a damaged U-boot.\n
Description Takali, Malta, Day 2.\n\n07:30\n\nWeather : Good, clouds at 1300 ft.\n\n'Attention !'\n\n'Survivors from convoy Aegeus ( six out of 13 ! ) finally reached Valetta yesterday evening. As the cargo were entering Grand Harbour, the escort destroyer HMS Townshend was hit by a German topedo.' 'We belive a submarine had been hiding there for days waiting for its moment'\n\n'Our destroyers and torpedo boats immediately began searching the area and dropped enough depth charges to wipe Pantelleria off the map, but they couldn't confirm the submarine was destroyed' 'However this morning at daybreak and as the fog lifted, coastal spotters reported fuel stains on the surface, due east of the Marsa Scala coastal battery. Visibility is still too obscured by clouds to tell with certainty, but it would seem the Germans were very badly hit.'\n\n'We want you to take off and fly over the area were the stains were reported. See if you spot further indications of fuel leaks and follow them to the source. The submarine cannot have got far with this kind of damage, but it will also have likely radioed for help.'\n\n'Find the U-boot, sink it, and destroy whatever the ennemy sent to rescue it.'\n\n'That'll be all. Good luck gentlemen.'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n
