Description Takali, Malta, Day 1\n\n04:20\n\nWeather : Good, clouds at 1300 ft.\n\n'Attention !'\n\n'Well done ! That ought to put our fascist friends out of commission for a while and relieve the pressure on Aegeus when they arrive. '\n\n'Sorry for those of you who were looking forward to catching up on their sleep, but we are not done making our preparations quite yet :'\n\n'As is their custom, the ennemy will be reinforcing their minefields along the convoy's expected route. There is already qite enough of them as it is and we won't let them add any more of the damned devices.  They've most likely been at it most of the night, and we will take advantage of the early dawn to take the late minelaying planes  by surprise.'\n\n'You will carry out a patrol North of Gozo and shoot down anything that looks like it's dropping things in the water. The Beaufighters will be sweeping the area East of you for minelaying ships, so make sure you identify your target before firing, it is still pretty dark out there.'\n\n'That'll be all gentlemen. Godspeed !'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n\nPlayer skin : Spit Vc Malta 1 to 7, markings off.\n
