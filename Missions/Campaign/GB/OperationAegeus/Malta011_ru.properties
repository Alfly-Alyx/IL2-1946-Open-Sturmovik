Description Takali, Malta, Day 2\n\n10:00\n\nWeather : Hazy, clouds at 3000 ft.\n\n'Attention !'\n\n'Valetta Harbour suffered some damage, and the ships and their precious cargo were badly hit too. One of them was sunk but there's no doubt it would have been much worse had it not been for your intervention.'\n\n'Coastal watchers just reported that an Italian pilot had to abandon his machine on his way back to Sicily after this morning's raid - Whoever claimed a 'damaged' this morning was just credited with a full kill. Congratulations ! - Intelligence service would like to have a talk with the fellow, so we are going to have to go fish him out of his raft.'\n\n'You will take off with a section of four and patrol the sea North of Valetta. When you have located the Italian pilot, radio in his position and we'll send a Walrus to pick him up.\nBe careful. The Italians will be wanting their pilot back and his squadron mates will certainly be out looking for him, so stay at Angels and keep your speed up to avoid any bad surprises. '\n\n'That will be all. Good Hunting !'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n
