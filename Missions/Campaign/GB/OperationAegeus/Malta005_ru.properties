Description Takali, Malta, Day 1.\n\n09:00\n\nWeather : Clear.\n\n'Attention !'\n\n'The first delivery of Spitfires went very well thanks to you, and we have already began distributing them to the units. They're not all exactly factory fresh and those Navy mechanics got a bit creative with the paintjobs, but they should help tremendously in tipping the balance in our favour in the area. We are expecting another batch to arrive within the next hour.'\n\n'You're on convoy patrol duty again. With the Germans and Italians apparently still at the top of their game, we are expecting anything from recce planes to massive raids of Torpedo bombers.'\n\n'Stay at 10,000 ft over the convoy and maintain visual contact with the ships at all times.'\n\n'That'll be all. Good luck gentlemen.'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n\nPlayer skin  : Spit Vc Malta 1 to 7.\n
