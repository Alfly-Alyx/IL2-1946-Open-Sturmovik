Name Malta 04 : The Arrival
Short Day 1, Takali, 7;30\n\nCover the arrival of the first wave of Spitfires and make sure no ennemy fighter interferes with the transfer.\n
Description Takali, Malta, Day 1\n\n07:30\n\nWeather : Good, clouds at 1300 ft.\n\n'Attention !'\n\n'The encounter with the Junkers over the convoy earlier this morning and the subsequent loss of a cargo prompted a slight change of plan.  The Royal Navy does not want to risk loosig their carrier. It has been decided that it would launch the Spitfires it carries and then turn back to Gibraltar under a reinforced escort so that operation Aegeus doesn't completely fail to reach its objective : bring us some much needed relief.'\n\n'The first wave of Spits is due to land at Takali and Luqa this morning at 7:40.  The fascists will be trying to interfere with the delivery. We are setting up a fighter cover over the East coast of the Island to make sure their efforts remain in vain.'\n\n'You will patrol off Grand Harbour at 10,000 ft. and engage any ennemy aircraft you spot.'\n\n'The Spitfires will be flown in with no ammunition to save weight and reduce fuel consumption. In addition, the pilots flying them have no combat experience. They'll be easy targets for the ennemy if they manage to get through the cover, so make sure that does not happen.'\n\n'That'll be all. Good luck gentlemen.'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n\nPlayer skin : Spit Vc Malta 1 to 7, markings off\n
