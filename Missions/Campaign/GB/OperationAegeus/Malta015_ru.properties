Name Malta 16 : Hide And Seek
Short Day 2, Takali, 17:45\n\nLook out for incoming ennemy raids North-East of Valetta. \n
Description Takali, Malta, Day 2\n\n18:00\n\nWeather : Hazy, clouds at 3300 ft.\n\n'Sons of... we're hardly done filling in the craters at Takali and already those damned Germans come and add some more at Luqa !'\n'Fortunately for us, our ground crews have become crater filling experts and are doing a fantastic job allowing us to stay operational despite the bombings. '\nWe lost a number of aircraft again, but at least that gave the dockers at Grand Harbour more time to deal with fires on the ships and unload them before the next raid.'\n\n'Meanwhile, a thick cover of clouds has begun to spread over the island, which we fear might allow German bombers to sneak through our defences at low altitude to strike Valetta. Guess what you will be making sure does not happen ?'\n\nPatrol your assigned sector at 10,000 ft. and do your best to try and spot Jerry through that murk.\n\n'That'll be all. Good luck gentlemen.'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n
