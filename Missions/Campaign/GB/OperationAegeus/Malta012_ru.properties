Name Malta 13 : Air Cover
Short Day 2, Takali, 12:45\n\nPatrol over Grand Harbour\n
Description Takali, Malta, Day 2\n\n12:45\n\nWeather : Clear, clouds at 3000 ft.\n\n'Attention !'\n\n'Nice catch ! The pilot we picked up was no teniente, he seems to be some kind of high ranking officer. We still haven't learnt  much from him as he doesn't seem to get along too well with the Intelligence Service people, but I'm confident their good British manners and hospitality will help untie his tongue...'\n\n'You'll be flying air cover over Grand Harbour to protect the unloading of the convoy. This morning's raid was most likely just an appetiser, and we are expecting larger raids on Valetta this afternoon.'\n\n'Climb to 13,000 ft and keep an eye out for those ennemy bombers.'\n\n'That'll be all. Good luck gentlemen.'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n
