Description Takali, Malta, Day 2\n\n15:00\n\nWeather : Clear, clouds at 3300 ft.\n\n'Attention !'\n\n'Well we certainly weren't expecting that ! Glad to see you could all land safely.This means we are now as likely to be bombed as Grand Harbour, even now that the ships have arrived.\nHalf of the Spitfires delivered yesterday have already been destroyed , we can't afford to loose more !'\n\nWith this new threat on the airfields, we need to extend your patrol  area. You will now fly around the island as advanced air spotters and call in reinforcements if you spot anything. We have to watch our fuel supplies and we can't afford to maintain all squadrons up all day just to keep them safe.'\n\n'Climb to 13,000 ft. and patrol your assigned area.'\n\n'That'll be all. Good luck gentlemen.'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n
