Name Malta 10 : Changing Of The Guards
Short Day 1, Takali, 16:30\n\nTake over a flight of Hurricanes as air cover over the convoy.\n
Description Takali, Malta, Day 1\n\n15:30\n\nWeather : Good, clouds at 3800 ft.\n\n'Well that was quite a fight wasn't it ? It looks like the Axis are as concerned about our new Spitfires as they are about convoy Aegeus. Several planes were destroyed or damaged on the ground during the attack and it has seriously reduced the number of Spits we'll be able to send up to counter the next raids.'\n\n'The good news is Aegeus was relatively untroubled while the ennemy's focus was on us. That gave them some time to breathe ater the loss of two further ships in the last massive raid earlier this afternoon. The convoy is now sailing along the East coast of the Island and is due to enter Grand Harbour in the next few hours.'\n\n'We are maintaining constant air cover over the ships. You will take off and take over the Hurricanes before they run out of petrol. '\n\n'Keep an eye out for ennemy planes, however unlikely it seems they'll be attacked this close to the island.'\n\n'That'll be all.' \n\n'Dismissed !'\n\nPlayer skin : Spit Vc Malta 1 to 7\n
