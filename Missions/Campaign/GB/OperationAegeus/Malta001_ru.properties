Name Malta 01 : Night Fighters
Short Day 1, Takali, 2:00\n\nEscort a squadron of Beaufighters carrying out a preventive strike on Comiso.\n
Description Takali, Malta, Day 1\n\n02:00\n\nWeather : Good, clouds at 1300 ft.\n\n'Attention !'\n\n'A squadron of Beaufighters will conduct a preventive strike on Comiso to cause as much damage and confusion as possible before convoy Aegeus enters the area. You will escort the Beaus to Comiso and protect them against the CR-42s the Italians are operating as night fighter-bombers in the area and that we fear might be scrambled  to intercept the raid.'\n\n'The Beaufighters are already up and assembling and you shall meet with them not far off Grand Harbour. They will be flying at 3000 ft. and we recommend you stay at 6000 ft. and above throughout the mission so as to keep you safe from the flak that we expect to be heavy over the target.'\n\n'Just keep an eye on the Beaus, stay back and watch as they make their attack. Do  not engage ground targets and try to avoid flying over the airfield unless if engaging ennemy fighters. We are taking a big risk with this raid - one we can barely afford - and we have to make sure as many of you get back to base safely and with pristine machines. We'll be needing them later today...'\n\n'I know night fighting is not usually part of your assignments, but  we need someone to fly as cover since our experienced night fighters pilots will be flying as bombers in today's raid. Fortunately for you it is a clear night and friends and foes should be easy enough to tell appart.'\n\n'I almost forgot, the lads from the night fighter squadron told me to warn you : do not stare straight at the searchlights. They said you'd understand in due time...'\n\n'That'll be all gentlemen. Godspeed !'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n\nPlayer skin : Spit Vc Malta 1 to 7, markings off\n
