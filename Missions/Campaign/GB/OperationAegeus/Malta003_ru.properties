Description Takali, Malta, Day 1\n\n06:00\n\nWeather : Good, clouds at 1300 ft., fog.\n\n'Attention !'\n\n'Convoy Aegeus entered our area of operations this morning at 5:30 after a long trip across the Mediterranean during which they already fended off several attacks by the Luftwaffe and Reggeia Aeronautica and lost two transports and a destroyer. Thankfully the carrier and the Spitfires it carries are safe thanks to an outstanding resistance by the Navy pilots.'\n\n'As a result of these attacks and in order to prevent further losses, a plan was devised by the brass at the Admiralty : The convoy has split up into two elements. The first one, comprising nine cargo ships and an escort of fast destroyers will be making a run first while the carrier and bigger destroyers will remain at a distance for now.'\n\n'You will take off with two sections and watch over the cargos as they enter the area. Keep an eye out for any ennemy activity, be it surface ships or airplanes. Don't stray too far from the convoy, this is close protection !'\n\n'That'll be all. Good luck gentlemen.'\n\n'Dismissed !'\n\nPlayer skin : Spit Vc Malta 1 to 7, Markings off\n
