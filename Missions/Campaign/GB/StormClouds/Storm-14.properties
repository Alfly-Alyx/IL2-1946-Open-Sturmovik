Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: March 28, 1945\nTime: 1800 hours\nType: Attack\nMet Report: Overcast clouds, low visibility, moderate winds\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (2x1000 lb. Bombs)\nMission Altitude: 500m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nWe've selected four of our best Tempest pilots to undertake this mission.  SHAFE has indicated that the Rhine bridgehead will be expanded in an all out offensive action.  In order to sow confusion in the local defense units, the Gestapo headquarters in Ottilienstadt will be attacked.  Other fighter-bomber units have been tasked with other duties so our Tempests have been selected for the duty.\n\nThe target is defended by flak, barrage baloons strung by high tension cables, and the target is obscured by low visibility.  Nonetheless, our objective is to make the attack with our Tempests and destroy the building.\n\nBy the time you reach your target a flare should be burning infront of the building dropped by a pathfinder Mosquito.  The Mosquito will drop the flare roughly one minute before your flight is scheduled to arrive at the target.  This should make your attack on the building easier.\n\nThis is an extremely risky operation so keep your wits about you!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy the Gestapo HQ building in Ottilienstadt\n- Return to base\n
