Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: March 12, 1945\nTime: 0730 hours\nType: Tactical Recon\nMet Report: Overcast, rain\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 600m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nLast night was an eventful night as I'm sure most of you were shaken from your beds on several occasions.  Hun bombers dropped several bombs on the airbase.  Two groundcrew were killed along with three Spitfires destroyed and two damaged.  Our Tempests escaped the attack unscathered.\n\nRain and heavy cloud has moved in during the early morning.  Met report suggests that this duff weather is not going to go away until late afternoon.\n\nOur objective is a TacR mission.  We suspect the Huns are planning another raid against the bridge head in bravo-five.  Tempest squadrons are on high alert and 486 has the first patrol.  Targets of opportunity are to be attacked but place special importance on enemy fighters and fighter-bombers.\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Defend bridgehead area from fighter-bomber attack\n- Attack targets of opportunity\n- Return to base\n
