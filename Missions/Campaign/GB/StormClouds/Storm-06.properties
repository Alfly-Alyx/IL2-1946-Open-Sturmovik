Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: March 11, 1945\nTime: 1900 hours\nType: Fighter Sweep\nMet Report: Light clouds, clear skies, no wind\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 1900m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nBridge crossings all along the Rheine are allowing for a powerful breakout into German controlled territory.  The borders of Germany itself are beginning to crumble.\n\nThe Tempest wings are the closest RAF units to the bridgeheads.  Our squadrons have been involved in operations all day long to keep the bridges safe from enemy air attack.  No. 3 squadron is currently on patrol over the crossing in grid bravo-five.  They are low on fuel and are preparing to return to Volkel.  We are running out of precious light, however, the threat from German bombers remains.  486 squadron has therefore been given the green light to fly a single flight on patrol over the bridge head.  US Army units are currently on both sides of the river and have taken positions.\n\nEnsure that you use the proper signal for identification or friendly flak may cause a few problems.\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Defend bridgehead area from fighter-bomber attack\n- Return to base\n
