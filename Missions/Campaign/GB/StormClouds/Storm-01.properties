Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description HISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\nFollowing the failed attempt by the Wermarcht (German Army) to break through the American lines during the Ardennes offensive the frontlines on the Western Front moved very little.  The winter of 1945 was a unusual cold one and weather caused various problems with air operations on both sides.  By March the Allied armies had reached the Rhine river and were preparing to cross it, however, initial attempts to cross were thwarted and many bridges along the Rhine river were destroyed.\n\nDuring early 1945, the 2nd Tactical Air Force (RAF) built much of its strength around 122 Wing which flew most of its sorties during this period from Volkel airbase in Belgium.  Close to the frontlines, Volkel was surprisingly missed during the New Years Day offensive by the Luftwaffe.  Pilots in 122 wing included such famous Tempest aces as Pierre Closterman and ___ Fairbanks.  As the Tempest was a complicated and difficult fighter to fly, usually only pilots with one full tour under their belt (either in Typhoons or Spitfires) was allowed to transfer into a Tempest squadron.\n\nIn this campaign, you will fly with 486 Squadron (RNZAF), which exclusively flew Tempest Mark Vs.  Other allied squadrons flying mostly Spitfire XVIs (Packard Merlin 266 modified Spitfire IXe's) and P-47Ds from the USAAF 9th Air Force will sometimes be available.\n\n\nAIRCRAFT MARKINGS\n\nPlease change your aircraft markings to: $SC-KRISTORF-TempestVlatewar.bmp\n\nBRIEFING\n\nDate: March 4, 1945\nTime: 0750 hours\nType: Tactical Recon\nMet Report: Partly cloudy, low visibility, moderate winds\nPreflight: 6xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 1000m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nWelcome to 486 squadron pilot.  You haven't had time to get your kit into your new bunk but we run a busy schedule in 122 wing and we've got an operation for the squadron.  Allied army units are massing near the Rhine river leading into Germany and consequently all Allied fighter and fighter-bomber units are involved in operations leading up to the offensive against Germany itself.  Although the back of the Luftwaffe was broken during the failed New Years Day offensive you should not have any illusions that they are a beaten force.  The pilots you will face are all that remains of the experienced fighter commanders and you will usually find poorly trained pilots flying alongside some of the best that the Luftwaffe has put forth.  The war is not yet over and this will not be an easy few months on the front line.\n\nPilots from 3 squadron reported a large number of trains along one of the main rail lines on their last op.  We're sending 486 to check out the area and look for any trains to attack.  As this is your first Tactical Reconnaissance mission with the squadron be sure to keep with your section and rally at a pre-determined point if you loose them.  The Huns are sure to put up some flak so watch out for that any any freelancing Luftwaffe fighter groups.\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Fly the assigned patrol route\n- Attack any enemy train activity\n- Report any enemy movements\n
