Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: March 15, 1945\nTime: 0935 hours\nType: Tactical Recon\nMet Report: Partly cloudy\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 900m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nDuff weather these last few days and nights.  Blind  visibility has restricted operations.  We've heard the sounds of a few Me-262's flying near the base but none have overflown it and the Jerries are probably having as much trouble with the weather as we are.  The Met report is much clearer today and operations can resume.\n\nAmerican 9th Air Force Thunderbolts from the 392nd Fighter Squadron are conducting tank busting operations ahead of advancing American troops.  We've been asked to fly 486's Tempests in a recon in force ahead of the Thunderbolts.  HQ has agreed to the arrangement.  Fly the sweep, protect the Thunderbolts and keep the Luftwaffe fighters off their backs.\n\nGood luck!\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy any enemy fighters encountered\n- Protect Thunderbolt fighter-bombers\n- Destroy any ground targets of opportunity\n- Return to base\n
