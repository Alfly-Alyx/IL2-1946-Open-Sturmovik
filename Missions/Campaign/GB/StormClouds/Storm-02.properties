Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: March 5, 1945\nTime: 1730 hours\nType: Tactical Recon\nMet Report: Overcast, rain, medium winds\nPreflight: 1xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 500m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nYour willingness to volunteer on this dangerous mission is appreciated by 122 Wing HQ.  Our intelligence on the Rheine airfield is out of date and we need to make a low pass to determine what, if any, activity is taking place as this airbase.  This operation takes place ahead of Operation Clarion  a fighter-bomber offensive against lorry and train movement.  All of our photo reconnaissance Spitfires are currently assigned to other higher priority targets so this is being undertaken as a volunteer only op by 122 Wing.\n\nYou would be well advised to make the pass as quickly as possible, note any activity, and fly away quickly.  Flak at Rheine is normally heavy although you may be able to surprise the gunners in this duff weather.\n\nMake special note if any Me-262 jet fighters are parked on the field.\n\nGood luck!\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Fly the assigned route\n- Conduct a low altitude pass at Rheine airbase and return\n\n
