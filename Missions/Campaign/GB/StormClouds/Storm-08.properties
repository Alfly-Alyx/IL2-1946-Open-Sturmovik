Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: March 12, 1945\nTime: 1145 hours\nType: Ratcatcher\nMet Report: Overcast, gusting winds at low levels\nPreflight: 2xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 800m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nMembers of the wing here at Volkel have devised a means to catch the low flying Me-262 jetfighters that conduct recon runs on our base.  We're calling them Rats and thus the whole operation is called "Ratcatcher".  We've just got word that a Rat is heading our way so the call has been put out.  You and one other Tempest are already on the runway.  Run your engine up and be ready for the Me-262 to pass over the base.  Gather your speed as quickly as possible and pursue the Me-262 to its base.\n\nMost Me-262's head for Remagen.  You may be able to snag it on landing if it mangages to get away.  Beware of the enemy's flak lines which protect the vulnerable jet fighters on landing.  They may also throw up Focke Wulfs or 109s to intercept you.  Now get out there and get your Tempest ready!\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy the Me-262 recon fighter\n- Return to base\n
