Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: March 9, 1945\nTime: 1100 hours\nType: Tactical Recon\nMet Report: Light clouds, hazy skies, slight wind\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (2xDroptank)\nMission Altitude: 2500m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe Huns have put a large number of fighters and fighter-bombers into the air this morning.  Increased activity warrants directed TacR missions.  486 squadron will sweep the designated path for enemy fighters and targets of opportunity.  Flak is known to be heavy around the major airfields but there are several hidden fields that we don't know about.  Our Spy officer over at HQ reports that army units may also be taking positions around old forts and castles to surprise attacking Allied aircraft with sudden flak barrages.\n\nReports have indicated that JG-26 may be amongst the units operating in this area of the front.  JG-26 is probably the most experienced fighter unit that most of our new pilots have encountered so far.  They will be difficult opponents in their new long nosed Focke Wulfs.  Remember to watch for them coming out of the sun.\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Perform recon in designated target area\n- Sweep the skies of enemy fighters\n\n\n
