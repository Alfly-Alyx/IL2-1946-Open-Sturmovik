Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: March 25, 1945\nTime: 1445 hours\nType: Attack\nMet Report: Some clouds, light winds, high visibility\nPreflight: 8xTempest Mark V (2x1000 lb. Bombs)\nMission Altitude: 2500m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe Hohne airbase continues to be a major source of Luftwaffe operations in the area.  The base has been the source of several fighter-bomber attacks against British and Canadian units moving along the north side of the theater.  HQ has ordered the base effectively shut down.\n\nNo. 3 and No. 486 squadron have been given the task of attacking the airfield and destroying as much as possible.  Primary targets are parked aircraft and support vehicles.  A recon Spitfire has already reported the base lacking any major facilities so targeting base structures is secondary as they are of lesser value.\n\nFlak will be heavy but fighter opposition is due to be light.  Good luck!\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Attack the Hohne Luftwaffe airbase\n- Return to base\n
