Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: March 17, 1945\nTime: 1400 hours\nType: Flak Supression\nMet Report: Partly overcast, gusty winds\nPreflight: 8xTempest Mark V (2x1000 lb. Bombs)\nMission Altitude: 800m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe Tjabenheim canal dock facility is the latest target for the Allied bombing campaign.  The target area has already been bombed twice in the last two months by B-17s and Lancaster bombers, however, damage has been repaired to the facility several times and several smaller ships have been using the facility to evacuate supplies to German army units.\n\nOur objective is to damage the facility using fighter-bombers and prevent its use long enough to allow capture by Allied armored units.  Already US Army commanders sit waiting for the order to strike at the facility, however, without a serious aerial campaign the fighting could be intense.  Our attack therefore fills a dual role of denying the enemy of supplies and making it easier for US Army units to move in and capture the area.\n\nHQ has sent word that the ban on Tempests to attack flak heavy ground targets is over and 486 squadron has been ordered to provide flak supression on two large flak batteries on the west and north sides of the facility. Multiple 88 flak units covered by Wirbelwind flak batteries and other smaller machine gun outposts cover the area.  Use bombs and cannons to destroy these batteries as best as possible and make it difficult for the enemy to put up any serious challenge to other fighter-bombers.\n\nSpitfire's will also be attacking enemy vehicles and train cars within the dock facility.  Mosquitos and other Allied bomber and fighter-bomber units are due to be in the area as well.  Luftwaffe response to the attack has so far been minimal so it should be clear for us all the way in and out.  Flak will be your worst enemy.\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Attack the flak batteries around the dock facility\n- Engage and shoot down any enemy fighters encountered\n- Return to base\n
