Short The Germans have begun launching their new V1 flying bombs against the South East of England. The Hawker Tempest is the best available interceptor for the job of shooting them down.\n
Description Newchurch Wing\nRAF Newchurch\nAir Defence of Great Britain\nJuly 1944\n\nOver the past couple of days as all of you are aware, Hitler's begun using his much vaunted 'vergeltungswaffen' or vengeance weapons against the British mainland.  From what we can gather these are rather crude, jet propelled, unmanned devices packed with explosives.  Basically when they arrive over the target the engine cuts out and down they go to make an awful mess of whatever lies beneath. So far casualties have been mainly civilian and fairly heavy.  We have to stop these monstrous devices before they reach their target area, which is usually London. They fly quite low and fast and they are also small and therefore hard to hit but I have every faith in the Newchurch wings pilots that they can do the job.  We'll be flying standing patrols of two aircraft over the channel in the path of the V1 launch sites.  Watch out for our own flak and barrage balloons if you start chasing one, and also be wary of the blast when they are hit. They have a lot of explosive on board.\n
