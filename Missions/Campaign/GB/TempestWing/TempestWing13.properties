Name The Bulge
Short Fly a sweep over German territory during their Ardennes offensive of December 1944\n
Description 122 Wing\nVolkel\nHolland\nDecember 1944\n\nThe Germans have surprised us again with what looks like an attempt to repeat their blitzkrieg of May 1940 through the Ardennes forest.  Unfortunately for the American troops who are trying to hold out in the area, the weather has been too bad for air close support operations.  There has been a slight break in the weather however and we are going to fly an armed recce, a rhubarb, in the area behind the German front line. If you see anything moving on the ground don't hesitate to call the attack, we need to take the pressure off the American troops who have been facing this onslaught without air support.  Keep your eyes skinned for the Luftwaffe, they've been increasingly aggressive in the past few weeks and they appear to be building up the number of fighters available to them as well.\n
