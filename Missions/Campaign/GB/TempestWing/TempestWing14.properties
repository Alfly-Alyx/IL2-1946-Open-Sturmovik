Name Bodenplatte
Short Bodenplatte\n
Description January 1st 1945\n\nOn new years day 1945 the Germans launched an attack on allied airfields with more than 800 fighter aircraft, practically everything they could muster from all corners of the Reich.  The idea was to wipe out allied air power on the ground and thus reestablish air superiority over the Western front. The attack, although it destroyed over 200 allied aircraft on the ground, was a disaster for the German fighter arm. Their losses ammounted to 300 fighters and 200 irreplacable pilots killed or captured. The RAF and USAAF lost a dozen pilots killed and one captured.  The German attack was also ill timed and should have taken place earlier before the first patrols had taken off. They would have caught more aircraft on the ground and they would not have been intercepted by those already in the air.\n\nSeveral squadrons from the Volkel wing were already flying and returning from armed recces to find German aircraft over the airfield or fleeing back toward the East after delivering their attacks. In addition, a squadron of Tempests were scrambled from Volkel, which was surprisingly given little attention by the Luftwaffe jabos.\n\nYou are flying back toward Volkel when you come across a scene of chaos with German aircraft hurling around an allied airfield amidst the flak and explosions of their own bombs.\n\n
