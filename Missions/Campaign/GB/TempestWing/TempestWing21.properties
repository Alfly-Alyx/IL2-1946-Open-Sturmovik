Name Airfield attack
Short Attack on a German airfield\n
Description 122 Wing\nRheine/Hopsten airfield\nGermany\nApril 1944\n\nThe Germans have abandoned all their main airfields as a result of allied bombing.  Their fighters are now operating from a large number of emergency bases built specifically for the sort of circumstances that they are now facing.  The geschwader don't spend much time at any of these bases, arriving at Dawn for their first operations, hiding out in the pine trees by the side of the runway and moving again within a few days.\nThe really bad news, apart from the difficulty in pinning down the specific location that they are currently using, is the presence of very dense concentrations of flak whenever an airfield is occupied by them.  These flak battalions move with the enemy fighter formations from base to base and form a potent deterrent to low level attacks.  We're talking about roughly 3 flak batteries, each with 9 multi barrel guns\n\nWe've been waiting for a chance to catch one of these bases whilst occupied, well here it is...a recce Spitfire has spotted about 100 enemy aircraft on an airfield within striking distance of Rheine. A squadron of fighter bombers will try to rendezvous  with us to take care of the flak emplacements, everything else is for us to shoot at.  Let's go then.\n
