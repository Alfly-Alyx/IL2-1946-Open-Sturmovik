Short German transports are trying to make a break for it across to Norway loaded with troops and equipment.\n
Description 122 Wing\nRheine/Hopsten\nGermany\nMay 1945\n\nThe final throw of the dice\n\nGerman transports and flying boats have been massing on the Baltic coast and with the stiffening of resistance in the area it seems that their intention is to carry on fighting from positions in Scandinavia.  Their staff officers are making a break for it in anything that will fly, Ju52s, Ju88 or He111 bombers or Storch liaison aircraft.\n\nI know we've flown a few shows already today and everyone's already had enough but Ops have asked for a maximum air effort against a concentration of these transports, we're talking in excess of 100 with fighter escorts, getting ready to load up and fly out from a base on the coast.  Weather is very poor in the area we're expected to operate but this is a high value target and with the war so clearly coming to a close we don't want Jerry getting any big ideas about last stands, especially with SS fanatics in charge.\n\nWe need to get off the ground fast, some coastal command strike aircraft are being diverted to land here.  Some of them are bound to be shot up.\n\n\n
