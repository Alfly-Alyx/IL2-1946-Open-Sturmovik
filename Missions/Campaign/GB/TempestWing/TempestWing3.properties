Name Flying Bombs at Dusk
Short The German V1 attacks haven't let up during the hours of darkness and we have been forced to fly patrols at night as well as during daylight hours\n
Description Newchurch Wing\nRAF Newchurch\nAir Defence of Great Britain\nAugust 1944\n\nThe V1 attacks are continuing round the clock and consequently we have been forced to use the Tempests of the Newchurch wing as night fighters flying standing patrols near the coast.  As well as the dangers from enemy action, night flying, especially in wartime has its own inherent dangers and there are more ways of getting killed than you might care to think of.  The watchword is safety first, don't get fixated and end up in a hole in the ground because you were chasing one of these infernal robots. We are sending the Tempests up singly at night whilst the daytime patrols are carried out by pairs of fighters.\n
