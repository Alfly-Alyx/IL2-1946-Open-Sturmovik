Name Milk run to Rheine
Short A rhubarb over the German fighter airfield at Rheine\n
Description 122 Wing\nVolkel, (B80) \nHolland\nOctober 1944\n\nSome of the pilots have been indulging in the highly dangerous sport of attacking Rheine airfield in flights or in pairs.  The flak is absolutely bloody deadly and so it should be for the main German fighter base in the area.  We've lost a number of Tempests on these types of sorties, but on the other hand it often results in the destruction of German aircraft in the circuit and it definitely must be making their pilots edgy too.  The gen is that we fly in at cloud level, dive hell for leather for the deck when we are near the airfield, nail anything that moves, especially in the air and climb balls out back into the clouds again. We make one pass only, no two ways about it. If anyone hangs around there he's getting shot down. Simple as that.\n
