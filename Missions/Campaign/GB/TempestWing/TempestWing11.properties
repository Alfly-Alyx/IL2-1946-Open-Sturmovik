Short Sweep over enemy territory\n
Description 122 Wing\nVolkel\nHolland\nNovember 1944\n\nWe're going to fly our 2nd Sweep of the day over German held territory.  The idea as always is to attack anything on the ground that moves on their side of the lines and of course keep an eye out for the enemy airforce.  No flak duels, it's never worth it. At the first hint of a flak trap put the throttle through the firewall and jink like hell til you're out of range. If we get split up or if anyone is separated from the squadron head straight for friendly territory.  Let's go hunting then.\n
