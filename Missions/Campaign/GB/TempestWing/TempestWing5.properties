Name Volkel
Short The wing has moved to Volkel in Holland\n
Description 122 Wing\nVolkel, (B80)\nHolland\nOctober 1944\n\nA few days ago the wing moved to the airfield at Volkel to lend support to the allied advance into Germany.  We have been joined by the Tempests of the Manston wing which gives us a total of five squadrons here. The V1 menace has almost completely petered out with the enemy retreat in France and Belgium. Only those that can be launched in the air from Heinkels over the North Sea are still causing a nuisance.\nWe have begun getting into a routine of armed reconnaissance flights into Germany, shooting up targets of opportunity and engaging the Luftwaffe wherever we find them.  Several pilots have already begun scoring since arriving here.\nWe are taking off now on a squadron strength patrol over the lines. You can almost smell victory in the air, it's just a matter of time now before we are in the German Reich itself.\n
