Description 122 Wing\nVolkel, (B80)\nHolland\nOctober 1944\n\nWe are flying a Rhubarb over the Northern Ruhr valley looking for enemy rail traffic or anything else that we see moving on the ground.  Despite our best efforts the Luftwaffe appears far from finished, there are plenty of enemy fighters still based in the area, and they don't give up so easily. There are several allied daylight bombing raids in progress so that aught to bring 'em out of the woodwork.\nStay alert boys and support each other when the balloon goes up. Remember teamwork makes the difference.
