Name The Bridge at Remagen
Short Defend the bridge\n
Description 122 Wing\nVolkel\nHolland\nMarch 1945\n\nThe American 1st army have arrived at Remagen and by a remarkable piece of luck have discovered the bridge there is intact.  The 9th armoured division have seized it and used it to create a small bridgehead on the right bank of the Rhine.  At the moment this bridge is extremely important and Jerry is throwing everything he has at it.\nThe American fighters are based further away from the frontline here and so they've asked us to help provide air cover for the bridge.\nWaves of German bombers have been hurled at it so far, including of course Arado and Messerschmitt jets.  We'll take the twilight patrol.  Keep a good look out because we're guaranteed to see some action on this sortie.\n
