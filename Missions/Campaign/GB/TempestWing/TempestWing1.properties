Short The new Hawker Tempest fighter has it's first encounter with the enemy in the air\n
Description Newchurch Wing\nRAF Newchurch\nJune 8th 1944\n\nLast month 'Bee' Beaumont declared the Newchurch wing operational on the Tempest but so far it has not been committed to battle.  Even during the Overlord operation our component squadrons remained in reserve. Today however we are at last able to fly our first offensive patrols over France.  The pilots love the Tempest, it's bloody fast and it packs a hell of a lot of punch.  Everyone's champing at the bit to get at the Jagdwaffe...\n\nBeaumont himself led this sweep near Rouen with 2 squadrons of Tempests, one of which flew cover.  The sight of 5 Me109s got their blood up and in a short sharp engagement during which the enemy had no hope of running for it, the Newchurch wing drew its first blood.  Wing Commander Beamont almost came a cropper when his aircraft took a cannon round in one of its wings, but the damage was not significant and he made it home.\n\nUse the Ctrl-F2 keys to cycle through camera views and you can watch US fighter bombers attacking German armour in a village East of Bayeux.\n
