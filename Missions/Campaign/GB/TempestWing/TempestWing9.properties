Name Flak busting
Short Provide support for allied bombing raid by attacking enemy flak guns\n
Description 122 Wing\nVolkel\nHolland\nNovember 1944\n\nThe Luftwaffe have been fairly quiet this month apart from their reconnaissance jets which are proving to be a real nuisance.  The Tempest wing flying out of Volkel are being worked hard and the pilots are dog tired. Quite a few are showing clear signs of the twitch, and no wonder with the losses we've suffered recently from flak.  Flak is our biggest enemy and the feeling is that it is far more dangerous than the Jerry fighters ever were. Today we're flying in support of a strike by tactical bombers against a German railyard. The Tempests are going to go in and strafe the flak positions around it so that the bombers can do their job without interference.  The weather is a bit marginal right up to about 15'000 feet. Ideal for the hun to dive down through and pick us off like cherries. At least it gives us something to hide in if the flak gets too hot.\n
