Name Sortie from Rheine
Short Sortie from Rheine\n
Description 122 Wing\nRheine\nWestern Germany\nApril 1945\n\nThe wing has moved forward and is now based at the old Luftwaffe fighter base at Rheine/Hopsten.  Until only a short time ago this was the main base for their jet operations in the area, now it's stuffed full of Tempests eager to see this bloody thing through to the end, and the sooner the better.\n\nNow ops control want  us to fly a twilight patrol along the autobahns.  Jerry fighter bombers have been hitting our transport columns and hampering our supply routes over the past few days, usually zipping over in the early evening and disappearing again before we can react.\nBe wary of our own bofors guns, they've understandably gotten a bit trigger happy around this time of day.
