Name Tempest Wing
Description A 22 sortie campaign flying the Hawker Tempest fighter with the Newchurch wing in 1944-45. The campaign is semi-historical with the aim of providing an overview of Tempest ops during the final year of the European war. Suggested settings are full real but allow external views so that you can enjoy watching other actions take place while you fly the waypoints. Disable the 'instant Success' icon in difficulty settings. I always feel that this option creates more problems when you have to do x, y and then z to move onto the next mission. Really this is an option that works better in online Coops. Just fly the waypoints if you can, try to attack when it's prudent to do so or if the situation demands it and land back at an allied base. Finally, begin this campaign with high rank, at least Squadron Leader. Have fun. Any problems or queries please feel free to e-mail me at EAF602Whizz@aol.com and I'll try to help.
