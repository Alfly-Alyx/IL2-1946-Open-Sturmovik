Name Wunsdorf attack
Short A sweep by 8 Tempests in the Bremen area\n
Description 122 Wing\nVolkel, (B80)\nHolland\nOctober 1944\n\nOps have decided that any sweeps over enemy territory should comprise no less than eight Tempests.  This acknowledges the fact that the Jagdwaffe are by no means a spent force. They can still put up considerable fighter formations and they still have some good pilots to lead them.\nWe are flying another sweep over the bremen area to check out the enemy airfields there for signs of activity. There are a couple of squadrons of Me109s operating out of Wunsdorf so we'll have to keep our fingers out.  Flak isn't the only killer of Tempest pilots at this stage of the war.\nYou know the score, eyes peeled, fingers out and don't relax  'til you're all back here shooting a line in the mess.\n
