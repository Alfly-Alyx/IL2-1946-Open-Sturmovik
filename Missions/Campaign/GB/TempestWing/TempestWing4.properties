Description Newchurch Wing\nRAF Newchurch\nAir Defence of Great Britain\nSeptember 1944\n\nThe Newchurch wing has recieved a lot of praise for its conduct in shooting down the German flying bombs attacking London. There have been some incredible acts of bravery among our pilots and some have run up impressive scores. The attacks however continue and they will go on until the army finally overruns their launch sites on the continent. It is time to take up another pair of Tempests on patrol. Perhaps today you might add more of these 'doodlebugs' as our American cousins call them, to the squadron account.\n
