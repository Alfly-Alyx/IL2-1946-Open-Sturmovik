Name Rat Catching
Short Try to intercept an Me262 as it lands back at its base\n
Description 122 Wing\nVolkel\nHolland\nNovember 1944\n\nOur tactical brains have come up with a possible answer to the problem of the apparently invulnerable German jets. The army have been going purple with rage at the reconnaissance and high speed bombing sorties these new jets have been subjecting them to. They want it stopped. The idea is that a pair of Tempests are on full alert on the runway ready to scramble the moment one of these things are spotted crossing the allied lines. We then head straight for the German jet base and hopefully catch it on its way home, gear and flaps down, lining up for a landing.  These tactics are already showing some promise with a couple of rare successes chalked up for Volkel pilots. On the down side Gerry's already showing signs of stiffening the flak at the jet bases, as if it wasn't hairy enough.\n\nRat scramble, lets go!\n
