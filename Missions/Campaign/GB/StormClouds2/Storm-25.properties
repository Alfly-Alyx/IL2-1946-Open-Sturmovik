Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: April 22, 1945\nTime: 1315 hours\nType: Escort\nMet Report: Light clouds, calm winds\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (2xDroptank)\nMission Altitude: 2000m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nUrgent orders have come to our attention.  There is a new priority target that has been presented to us by group command.  The information is unclear but there appears to be a meeting of frontline commanders in nearby Ottilienstadt.  The Tempests from 33 squadron are preparing to launch the attack.  We suspect that there may be a significant number of Luftwaffe fighters covering this meeting so we're scrambling other wings along the front.\n\nAlthough 3 squadron is not officially part of this operation we've been granted the green light by HQ to meet the Tempests and sweep the target area providing 33 squadron extra cover while a group of Mustangs from the Polish squadrons provide cover at higher altitudes.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Escort the Tempests to the target\n- Destroy any Luftwaffe aircraft sighted\n- Return to base\n
