Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: April 19, 1945\nTime: 1700 hours\nType: Tactical Recon\nMet Report: Medium clouds, light winds, haze\nPreflight: 8xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 3500m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nAllied army units have made good progress over the last few days and its all thanks to a combined effort across the front from the 2nd Tactical Air Force and the American 9th Air Force.  Spitfires from several of our squadrons have successfully destroyed a major rail target and destroyed many vehicles on the roads.\n\nGerman transport crews are increasingly traveling at night due to the harrasement they are experiencing.  Todays mission is intended to send a similar message to the Luftwaffe.\n\nWe're low on available aircraft, however, our crew chiefs have managed to make eight Tempests available for this mission.  The objective is a tactical recon mission to the Hohne area.  You're all probably familiar with the territory now so we're sending 3 squadron in.  We've been blessed with a spate of clearer weather this evening so lets make the best of it.\n\nAny Luftwaffe aircraft that you see in the skies is to be dealt with swiftly.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Tactical recon in the Hohne area\n- Return to base\n
