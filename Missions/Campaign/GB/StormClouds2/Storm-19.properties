Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: April 10, 1945\nTime: 1045 hours\nType: Attack\nMet Report: Hazy, moderate winds\nPreflight: 8xTempest Mark V (2x1000lb Bombs)\nMission Altitude: 1500m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nPilots from 3 squadron have located an Allied POW camp and a V-2 launch site.  Information regarding both targets has been relayed to HQ.  Their decision is to strike the V-2 site while other operations are prepared to free the POWs.\n\nThe V-2 rockets are a dire threat as they cannot be intercepted by our fighters like the V-1 can.  We've been instructed as a general order by Group and 122 Wing HQ that V-2 sites should be a priority target.\n\nOur Tempest's have been armed with bombs and we'll be hitting the launch sites, rockets, trucks, buildings, and anything else of importance at the site.  Look out for fighters and destroy that launch site.\n\nWe've called in a favour for some extra fighter escort.  They should keep any Luftwaffe fighters at bay.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy the V-2 launch site\n- Return to base\n
