Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: April 27, 1945\nTime: 1130 hours\nType: Combat patrol\nMet Report: Partly cloudy, light winds\nPreflight: 8xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 2000m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nHQ has confirmed our groups sighting of a rare German fighter with a push and pull propeller design.  They tell us this is one of the new Dornier aircraft that has been sighted in a few places across the front.  It's faster than any of our fighters so if another one is sighted, you are to dive on it during the attack like we have been against the 262s. \n\nThe strike at the Hawker Factory has now deeply affected our supply of new Tempests.  Replacements have only trickled down to the front lines and we're low on our precious fighters.  Despite this, we're still operational and will continue as long as we have serviceable aircraft.  We have eight aircraft available for this next mission.\n\nOur new orders from group are to fly a combat patrol over the Messerwerk area.  The Yanks are sending a large strike package from the 9th Air Force to the Messerwerk aerodrome and they have asked for additional fighter cover in the area.\n\nYour goal is not to escort the Americans but provide a blanket search and destroy over the area.  If the enemy is in the air, your objective will be to shoot them down.\n\nA Canadian Mustang has taken photos of the aerodrome and they report at least a few Me 262 jet fighters and a recent delivery of Bf109s.  Be prepared for anything!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Sweep the Messerwerk area for enemy fighters\n- Return to base\n
