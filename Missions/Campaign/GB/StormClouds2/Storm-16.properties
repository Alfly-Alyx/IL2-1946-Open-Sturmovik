Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: April 2, 1945\nTime: 1315 hours\nType: Attack\nMet Report: Partly cloudy\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (2x1000lb Bombs)\nMission Altitude: 1400m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nAmerican Dakota transports have been dropping troops and cargo during the night and early morning as British and American troops continue to push forwards into Germany.  The breakout at the Rhine river continues to expand.\n\nOur orders for today are to attack an artillery emplacement near Bergen.  Allied troops are already in the valley nearby and are calling for assistance from the barrage of artillery and rocket fire landing on their positions.\n\nDue to losses to the Tempest squadrons we can only afford to field a single wing to attack the artillery positions.  Spitfires from another squadron will be supporting us in this mission.\n\nAs with the attack at Rheine airbase we will have to contend with more flak.  Recon Spitfires have not been fired on with any intensity so we may catch a break here.  Cross your fingers lads.  Come back alive!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Attack the artillery position\n- Return to base\n
