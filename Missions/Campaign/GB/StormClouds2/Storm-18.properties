Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description SKIN CHANGE\nCongratulations! You've been transfered to 3 Squadron.  Change the skin of your Tempest to $SC-KRISTORF-TempestVlatewar2.bmp \n\nBRIEFING\n\nDate: April 9, 1945\nTime: 1430 hours\nType: Tactical Recon\nMet Report: Overcast clouds, moderate winds, light rain\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 500m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nWelcome to B.112 pilots.  Some of you are probably already quite familiar with Rheine airbase from the air.  Some of you probably remember what the previous owners did to the place with their flak batteries and their jet fighters.  I assure you that the decor will improve significantly over the next few weeks.\n\nI'd also like to welcome all of the new pilots to 3 squadron from 486 squadron.  Some of you have seen quite a bit of action already and we're happy to have some more seasoned pilots in the squadron.\n\nThis afternoons objective is to fly a sweep into German controlled positions in front of the advancing allied armies.  We're looking for artillery positions, trains, vehicle convoys, bunkers and any new construction.  Of course we're also looking for the Luftwaffe and whoever else is crazy enough to fly in this mess.  The weather is bad so watch your instruments and follow your flight leader.\n\nGood luck!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Sweep the waypoints for enemy activity on the ground and in the air\n- Return to base\n
