Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: April 5, 1945\nTime: 630 hours\nType: Tactical Recon\nMet Report: Fog, scattered clouds\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 4000m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nGood morning chaps.  The Luftwaffe base located near Messerwerk has recently received significant amounts of activity according to reconnaissance photos.  Intel speculates that the base may be a staging ground for further attacks on Amsterdam with air launched 'buzz bombs'.\n\nPriority has been placed to observe this airfield and to this end we will fly a tactical recon mission to scout the area.  Our objectives are to sweep for aircraft already in the air or on landing approach.  Avoid attacking the base directly as the flak screen is likely to be significant and we are not yet prepared to launch an attack on the base.\n\nLosses due to ground based fire are to be minimized whenever possible so do not risk your aircraft without cause.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Fly a sweep of the designated waypoints\n- Destroy any aircraft you encounter\n- Return to base\n
