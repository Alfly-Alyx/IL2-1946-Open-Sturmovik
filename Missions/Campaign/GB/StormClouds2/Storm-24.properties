Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: April 20, 1945\nTime: 0445 hours\nType: Attack\nMet Report: Nearly overcast clouds, moderate winds\nPreflight: 4xTempest Mark V (2x1000lb Bombs)\nMission Altitude: 800m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nGood morning everyone.  We know you're tired and that the back to back missions are a strain.  We're running short on supplies and new Tempests due to the Hawker factory strike. We'll make due with what we can. This is a strain on all of us here and accidents are on the rise.\n\nYour Tempests have been bombed up as we have a priority target.  A German army supply depot loaded with fuel tanks and fuel trucks has been spotted close to our lines near Ottilienstadt.  Four Tempests will attack the target dropping bombs and strafing the target.  It is recommend that you attack only twice before the flak becomes too intense.\n \nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy the fuel depot\n- Return to base\n
