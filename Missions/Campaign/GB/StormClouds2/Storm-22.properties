HQ has passed a message through 122 Wing command to personally thank the Tempest pilot who ran the vital recon mission. \n\nGerman army units are taking advantage of the poor weather to retreat to new holding positions to resist the Allied advance.  They have bargained and lost as the weather is still good enough for our fighter-bomber units to launch a sustained assault on any vehicles or armored units moving in the open.\n\nLightnings and Mosquitos have been scrambled to strike at major targets along the front line. 3 squadron has been asked for support by flying a patrol near Hohne, which is known to be a major Luftwaffe base.  Avoid the aerodrome directly and attack any identified enemy aircraft.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Fly patrol of the Hohne area\n- Return to base\n
