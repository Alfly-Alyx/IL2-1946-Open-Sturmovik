Name Storm Clouds
Short STORM CLOUDS\nBy IceFire\n\nFly for the Royal Air Force in the last weeks and days of World War II as a Tempest pilot.\n
Description BRIEFING\n\nDate: May 2, 1945\nTime: 1530 hours\nType: Attack\nMet Report: Light clouds\nPreflight: 12xTempest Mark V (Default)\nMission Altitude: 1000m\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThere is a real sense amongst the pilots today that the war is almost over.  Already squadrons in the 2nd TAF have stood down and moved back to their bases in England.  The Luftwaffe continues to appear but in smaller numbers. With the Soviets closing the gap from the east we're fighting all that remains of the once mighty Luftwaffe.\n\nThe offensive against Luftwaffe airbases continues.  A photo recon Spitfire has overflown the Luftwaffe base at Sachsenheim for the last few days.  This mornings overflight revealed a great deal of activity and it looks as if the base is being evacuated.\n\nWith widescale reports of Luftwaffe units leaving their forward bases it seems that we may have another evacuation underway. Today we make a strike against one of the few remaining Luftwaffe bases in our sector.\n\nFly to the base and do whatever damage you can.  Any aircraft in the air or on the ground are legitimate targets.  Destroy fuel trucks and supplies.  The Luftwaffes ability to fight must be reduced to nothing. \n\nMaybe we can go home soon.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Attack the Luftwaffe airbase at Sachsenheim\n- Return to base\n
