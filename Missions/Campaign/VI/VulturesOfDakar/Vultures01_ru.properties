Name 01-Patrol
Short Patrol between Oukam and  Mbour.\n
Description 2eme Escadrille, Groupe de Chasse I/4\n\nDakar, Senegal\n\nIt was just three months yesterday from that infamous June capitulation. Many things have happened since that time. \n\nGermans had intended to disband our airforce, but when we were suddenly attacked by the British at Mers El K\u00E9bir they agreed we could retain some power in keeping off the British onslaught in our colonies...\n\nOur unit flew to North Africa just after the Armistice and then we were ordered to move to Dakar, Senegal.\n\nLousy and boring, this piece of 'heaven'....\n\n23 September 1940\n\nWe are sent on a patrol mission between Oukam and Mbour today. What are they expecting us to see? Mosquitos?\n\nPlease select skin $GeneriqueGGc-I-41941-2ereEsc.bmp\n\nSwitch markings off. \n\n
