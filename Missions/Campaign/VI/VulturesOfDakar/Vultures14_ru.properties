Short Patrol over our ships.\n
Description 2eme Escadrille, Groupe de Chasse I/4\n\nDakar, Senegal\n\n28 September 1941\n\nIt was a year ago when he had to face the British and gaullist onslaught...\n\nMany things have happend since then - the gaullist traitors are now in Gabon where our comrades did not put as good fight as we did...\n\nWe have added red and yellow stripes on our planes' fuselages in order not to be confused with the so called "Free French". We might encounter them in the air and not want to shoot down our own boys by accident...\n\nNowadays we have to fly sea patrols - British sea planes pester our ships from time to time, so we have to protect them.\n\nYou will be flying such mission today.\n\n\nPlease NEW select skin AC Feuillat GC 1 4 Dakar-Ouakam 1942.bmp\n\nSwitch markings off. \n\n
