Name Mission 3.
Description Tong airfield, French Indochina, September 23rd, 1940.\n\nStand easy Gentlemen.\n\nYesterday Japanese forces began an advance towards Lang in direct contravention of an agreement reached between our two Governments.  Diplomatic efforts to stop the advance are continuing, but it appears the Japanese are determined to take the railhead at Lang in order to stop supplies from the port at Haiphong getting through to China.  Our Indochinese Colonial troops and the Foreign Legion are in action against the invading forces as I speak, there has also been a Japanese air raid on the airfield near Lang at 10:00 hours today, as yet I have no further details.  You will take a patrol to the area around Lang and if any Japanese aircraft show up feel free to engage.\n\nOn return to the airfield taxi to the control tower.\n\nTake off:  11:00\nConditions:  Good\nClouds:  1000M\n
