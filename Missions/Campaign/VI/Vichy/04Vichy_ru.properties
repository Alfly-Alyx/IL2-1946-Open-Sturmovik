Name Mission 4.
Description Tong airfield, French Indochina, 24th September 1940.\n\nStand easy Gentlemen. \n\nThe Japanese launched five assaults against the airfield at Lang yesterday, unfortunately our fighters were unable to intercept any of them, one Potez was destroyed and another damaged, leaving only two of the four aircraft  that were transfered there usable.  Due to the situation the remaining aircraft have been removed from the airfield.  As of this morning a Potez 631 has been put at our disposal, it arrived at 6:30 this morning and is currently undertaking a recon mission at Loc Dinh-Chi My.  Your task this afternoon is to provide escort to a single Potez 25, it will be observing the action around Lang, and directing artillery if needed.  There have been reports of Japanese fighters in the area, so you may finally get an opportunity to fire your guns in anger, but be very wary their aircraft are extremely agile.\n\nI wish you good luck.  Dismiss.\n\nOn return to the airfield taxi to the Headquarters building.\n\nTake off:  14:00\nConditions:  Hazy\nClouds:  700M\n
