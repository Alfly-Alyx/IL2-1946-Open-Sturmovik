Name Mission 9.
Description Nakorn Bat airfield, French Indochina, December 1st 1940.\n\nGood morning Gentlemen.\n\nThai forces have moved deeper into Batdambang province over the last few days, and it would appear that this is their main thrust into our territory.  The Colonial administration has decided that we need to move fighter aircraft closer to the front and be in a position to defend the airfield at Batdambang if the Thai Army advances any further.  Therefore, it has been decided that your flight will deploy as soon as possible to the area until further notice.  This stretches our rather limited assets further apart than I would like, nonetheless,  go you must.  Once you depart from here proceed to the border and do a sweep along it before setting a heading for a landing at Batdambang.\n\nOn landing park your aircraft near the main hangers.\n\nGood luck Gentlemen. Dismiss.\n\n\n\nTake off: 07:30.\nWeather: Hazy.\nClouds: 600M.\n\n
