Name Mission 4.
Description Batdambang airfield, French Indochina, December 2nd 1940.\n\nGood morning Gentlemen, be seated.\n\nYesterday a raid was conducted by Thai aircraft from the airfield at Chanthaburi against one of our naval vessels, the Beryl.  Thankfully no damage was sustained by the boat or her crew and one of the Thai aircraft was brought down by the vessels gunners.  This is yet another incident in a steadily mounting series of skirmishes between our armed forces.  The Thai offensive on the ground seems to stop and start, but  their Air Force  is very active and continues to mount a number of nuisance raids along the border.  Today you will conduct a patrol around  the main area of Thai operations, hopefully their aircraft  will  make an appearance while you are in the area.  \n\nDismiss.\n\nTake off: 9:30.\nWeather: Good.\nClouds: 800.\n\n\n\n\n
