Name Mission 7.
Description Nakorn Bat airfield, French Indochina, November 21st, 1940.\n\nGood morning Gentlemen, please be seated.\n\nFirst of all I'd like to welcome you to Nakorn Bat, I was in a staff meeting when you arrived yesterday so was unable to greet you then, please accept my appologies. Due to the current diplomatic situation this airfield has now become the headquarters to E.C 2/595.\n\nAs you are aware there has been a general thawing in the relationship between ourselves and the Government of Thailand.   Their  Head of State, Luang Pibun Sangram and other members of the Thai establishment  feel the time may be right to use military force  to seize territory  from us that we have administered since  the turn of the Century, land they consider rightfully theirs.  The situation along our extensive border is fluid, Thai military units appear to be trying to provoke a major incident,  their ground forces have crossed the border at various points and  there have been a number of clashes with our troops.  Artillery exchanges are frequent and bomber aircraft on both sides have been supporting the soldiers in the field.  Events may soon get out of hand and escalate into a major conflict.\n\nThis morning  your aircraft will make a sweep along the border to clear the area prior to two of our bombers making a strike against Thai forces in the area, if any Thai aircraft are in the vicinity of our ground forces, feel free to engage them. \n\nGood luck Gentlemen, dismiss.\n\nTake off: 07:30\nWeather: Clear.\nClouds: 1000M. \n
