Name Mission 13.
Description Bandambang airfield, French Indochina, December 24th 1940.\n\nGood afternoon, at ease.\n\nToday the Government of Thailand officially declared it is in a state of war with the Vichy French colonial authorities here in Indochina.\nIt was decided some days ago that in the event of a declaration of this sort our heavy bombers would need to conduct operations against Thailands major industrial and military infrastructure, including targetting bangkok itself, the very heart of the regime.\n  To be able to successfuly undertake these operations it is necessary to gather up to date intelligence on those possible targets.  This is the reason you have spent the last few days re-familiarising  yourself with the Potez 631.  You were the natural choice, you have many hours on twin aircraft and had been heavily involved with the aircrafts introduction into service here, you have also spent time in Bangkok shuttling the attache around the region.  Your task is straight forward enough, recon the heart of the city and return with the intel.  It is not known if Thai fighters patrol at night but they must be aware we have the capability for night flying, so if you do meet them your best weapon is speed, out-run them, do not try to engage.\n\nThank you Gentlemen, good luck, dismiss.\n\nTake off: 018:15.\nWeather: Clear.\nClouds: 1000M.\n\nSelect skin: Potez 631 Vichy.bmp\n\n\n\n\n
