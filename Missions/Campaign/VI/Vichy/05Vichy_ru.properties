Name Mission 5.
Description Tong airfield, French Indochina, 25th September 1940.\n\nAt ease Gentlemen. \n\nThe Japanese continue to advance on Lang, our forces in the field have been fighting hard to stem the progress of their assault, however, sheer weight of numbers are on the side of our enemy.  Sadly our troops are being forced to mount a fighting withdrawl to the town itself.  We have had two Potez 25's airborne today  helping the gunners range on the advancing troops and keeping field Commanders up to date on the evolving situation.  You Gentlemen will escort a third into the area and provide a much needed fighter presence over the battlefield.\n\nI wish you good luck.  Dismiss.\n\nOn return to the airfield taxi to the Headquarters building.\n\nTake off:  16:00\nConditions:  Good\nClouds:  1000M\n
