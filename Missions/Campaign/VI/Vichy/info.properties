Name Air War Indochina.
Short \n
Description Static Campaign for Vichy French Fighter Pilot.\n\nIt is the year 1940, French Indochina.  On the border with China are Japanese military forces who the French colonial administration has allowed to transit through areas of their territory.  The japanese military, going against all diplomatic protocols have gone beyond the letter of the agrement between the two Governments and established an advanced station over the border in Tonkin, modern day Vietnam.  On the 22nd September 1940 their forces advanced on the French administered town of Lang, provoking what generally became known as the Lang Son incident.  In neighbouring Thailand, the Government, led by the Dictator Luang Pibun Sangram was pressing for the return of territory taken by the French at the turn of the Century that it claimed  as its own. The Vichy  Government in Indochina, isolated from France was forced to somehow retain control of its colonial interests in the area. All around them are military forces far superior in numbers.  The British are in control of Burma, Malaysia and Singapore, the Japanese are exerting their influence over much of the region with their forces already occupying parts of China, and next door a belligerent Thailand.\n\n The Vichy French Air Force has a mottley collection of aircraft at its disposal with which to defend its substantial territory, unable to update or replace the limited numbers of aircraft it has, your task will be to defend your national interests against the forces around you with what little you have.\n\nSelect highest rank.\n\nTurn off no instant success so you can proceed even if mission goals are not achieved.\n\n\Please note that loading times for the campaign and each mission can be fairly lengthy.\n\nPeter Shaw, aka Mission_bug, January 2009.
