Name Mission 16.
Description Batdambang airfield, French Indochina, January 10th 1940.\n\nAt ease Gentlemen.\n\nEarlier today one of our recon aircraft flew over bangkok to confirm the intel gathered from the mission on the 24th.  Tonight the bombers will strike at the heart of the City.  The buildings there are predominantly wooden in construction so the effectivness of our bombing should bring results out of all proportion to the force we are to send.  You Gentlemen will be going along with them in the Potez 631's, not specifically to escort, more to act as roving intruders.  You will leave later than the bomber stream but will be over Bangkok around the same time.  Position yourself near to Don Muang, not too closly mind, and be ready to intercept any aircraft that may rise to intercept the bombers. Hit and run is your task Gentlemen, not to dogfight, use your power and speed to advantage, draw the enemy away from the bombers then extricate yourself as best you can and return home along your own route, the bombers will make their own way home.\n\nGood hunting Gentlemen, and good luck.\n\nTake off: 018:30.\nWeather: Clear.\nClouds: 1500M.\n\nSelect skin:  Potez 631Vichy.bmp\n\n\n\n\n
