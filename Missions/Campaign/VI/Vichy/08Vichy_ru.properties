Name Mission 8.
Description Nakorn Bat airfield, French Indochina, November 1940.\n\nGood afternoon Gentlemen, at ease.\n\nThere isn't much to report on the military situation at the moment, our troops haven't reported any incidents with Thai ground forces during the day and none of our patrols have met their aircraft.  This evening for the last sortie of the day I  want you to take a flight up to the area of the coast marked on the map.  The Navy has been operating in and around Thai waters recently, so the Thai Air Force periodically mounts patrols along the coastal border to try and intercept our amphibians, so it will do you no harm to familiarise yourself with the area just in case we are called on to operate in support of the Navy.  Your return flight path will take you over Batdambang, the principal population centre of the region, and as such the seat of the colonial  Government in the province.\n\nI would think it highly unlikely you will encounter anything this late on, but be on your guard.\n\nThat's all ,dismiss.\n\nTake off: 17:15.\nWeather: Hazy.\nClouds: 1000M.\n\n
