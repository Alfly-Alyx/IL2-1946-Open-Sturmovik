Name Mission 6.
Description Tong airfield, French Indochina, 26th September 1940.\n\nAt ease Gentlemen, please be seated. \n\nI have received conflicting reports today of the situation at the front, the general consensus is that Lang has fallen to Japanese forces and they have now secured their objective, namely the main rail line into China.  I am also led to believe that a ceasfire now exists, although confirmation has not as yet been forthcoming through official channels.  Therfore, business as usual until officialdom chooses to give us the exact details.  \n  Yesterday proved to be quite eventful, we lost a Potez 25 even though a patrol arrived as it was being engaged.  Another Potez 25 had a lucky escape, Moranes again managed to engage the enemy fighters, the outcome being more favourable on this occasion.  finally a Potez 631 on a recon flight was attacked by KI-27's, although  it was able to out run them and return home safely.  \nThe 631 has performed the only flight of the day thus far, uneventful on this occassion, thankfully.  I would like you Gentlemen to perform a sortie up to Lang and back, if it is correct about a ceasfire it should be a stroll, but be on your guard.\n\nDismiss.\n\nOn return to the airfield taxi to the control tower.\n\nTake off:  17:00\nConditions:  Good\nClouds:  1000M\n
