Name Mission 2.
Description Tong airfield, French Indochina, 22nd September 1940.\n\nGood morning Gentlemen, please be seated.\n\nI have recieved a report from the army this morning, it would appear that Japanese units have been making their way towards the advanced station just over our border.  The commander in the field has made a request for air support to aid his intelligence gathering capacity and if need be support his forces in the event of hostilities.  We are not sure of the intentions of the Japanese military forces at this time but we are to despatch two Potez 25's to the airfield near Lang.  You Gentlemen will accompany these aircraft to Lang before returning here.  As of yet there have not been any encounters with Japanese forces, but it will give you the opportunity to familiarise yourselves with the area.\n\nOn return to this airfield park your aircraft near to the control tower on the right of where  you land.\n\nThat's all Gentlemen, dismiss.\n\nSet release chocks for take off as the runway acts like an aircraft carrier.\n\nTake off:  9:30 AM.\nConditions:  Poor.\nClouds:  700M.\n\n\n
