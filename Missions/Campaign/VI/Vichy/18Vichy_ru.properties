Name Mission 18.
Description Nakorn Bat airfield, French Indochina, January 24th 1941.\n\nGood morning Gentlemen, be seated.\n\nIt has been a little quiet here recently, the conflict on the ground has to all intents and purposes reached a stalemate.  Thai forces have been held on the outskirts of Batdambang and the Japanese are pursuing diplomatic initiatives to bring the fighting to an end.  Even though the Thai Air Force has a numerical superiority over us, their aircraft have been fairly inactive during the last week or so, but we must not become complacent, they may be waiting for the right moment to strike.  Therefore, the regular patrols will have to continue for now with whatever aircraft we have available.\n\nTelephone rings, and sirens begin to wail.\n\nDamn they're early, to your aircraft Gentlemen, an enemy formation is reported nearing Siemreap, most probably heading our way.\n\nTake off: 6:30.\nWeather: hazy.\nClouds: 1000M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
