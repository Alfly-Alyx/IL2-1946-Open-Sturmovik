Name Mission 1.
Description Pakse airfield, French Indochina, September 21st 1940.\n\nGood morning Gentlemen, at ease.\n\nWe have a situation developing along the Chinese border.  For a while now our Government has allowed the Japanese forces in China access to territory we administer, however, it would seem elements within the Japanese military have gone against the excepted diplomatic protocols agreed between our two Governments.  A Farman 221 on a routine reconnaissance of the border area has detected what our intelligence staff believe to be a Japanese military settlement in Lang Son Province, within striking distance of the town of Lang.  Japanese intentions are not clear at the moment but our administration has sent word of its displeasure at these events to Tokyo and is awaiting a response.  I have orders to deploy elements of E.C. 2/595 to Tong from where we will await developments.\n\nBe aware the airfield at Tong is fairly rough.  Army engineers have laid a metal strip to aid our operation there, when you land make your way to the headquarters building to your left and park there.  Taxiing needs to done very slowly and carefully or you are likely to break something.\n\nI bid you a safe journey Gentlemen and hope this will not turn out to be anything other than a minor diplomatic rangle.\n\nTake off:  16:30 PM.\nConditions:  Hazy.\nClouds:  1000M.\n\nSelect skin:  Capt Pouyade EC 2 595 Tong 1942.bmp  Use this skin throughout the campaign.\n
