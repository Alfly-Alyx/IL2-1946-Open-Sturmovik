Name Mission 15.
Description Batdambang airfield, French Indochina, January 9th, 1940.\n\nGood morning Gentlemen, stand easy.\n\nThe last few days has seen the onset of a concerted Thai bomber offensive against our Cities and airfields.  They hit our home base at Nakorn Bat yesterday for the first time, there have also been raids on Sisophon, Vientiane and Pakse.  It may be our turn today.  We are aware of a formation of aircraft which has just crossed the border, heading in this general direction, although it may alter course at some stage we will launch a standing patrol around the airfield just in case it is headed our way.\n \nGood luck Gentlemen, dismiss.\n\nTake off: 09:00.\nWeather: Clear.\nClouds: 1000M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
