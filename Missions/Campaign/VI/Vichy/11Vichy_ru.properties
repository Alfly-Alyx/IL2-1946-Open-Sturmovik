Name Mission 11.
Description Batdambang airfield, French Indochina, December 10th 1940.\n\nGood morning Gentlemen, at ease.\n\nNot much to report this morning other than the fact that one of our aircraft has been reported missing somewhere near the coast.  Thai newspapers are reporting that one of their Corsairs brought down a Vichy aircraft yesterday so these events may be linked, although I am not in possession of all the details at the moment.  We seem to be experiencing a growing number of incidents as the days go by. The Navy reports that our Loire seaplanes are finding it increasingly difficult to operate around our coastal waters due to constant harassment by Thai aircraft,  so this morning you wil take a patrol out over the water near one of our normal patrol routes to show the Navy we are taking their problems very seriously.  It will also be good for their moral if they know we are around  and they are not completely alone out there.\n\nGood luck Gentlemen, dismiss.\n\nTake off: 06:30.\nWeather: Hazy.\nClouds: 1000M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
