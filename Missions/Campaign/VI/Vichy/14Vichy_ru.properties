Name Mission 14.
Description Batdambang airfield, French Indochina, January 8th 1941.\n\nGood morning Gentlemen, at ease.\n\nThe Army has become aware of a Thai supply depot in the area here on the map, and has asked us to launch a strike against these provisions at the earliest opportunity.  We have assembled a force of six Potez 25's for the task which we intend to undertake this morning.  Your mission is simple Gentlemen, make sure no harm comes to the strike force.  We hope that the early departure will allow us to the target and back before a Thai patrol reaches the area, but be on your guard, their patrols are very unpredictable.\n\nGood luck.  Dismiss.\n\nTake off: 06:30.\nWeather: hazy.\nClouds: 500M.\n\nSkin: Capt Pouyade EC 2 595 Tong 1942.bmp\n\n\n\n\n\n
