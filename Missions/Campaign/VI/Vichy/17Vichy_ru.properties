Name Mission 17.
Description Nakorn Bat airfield, French Indochina, January 11th 1941.\n\nWelcome home Gentlemen, at ease.\n\nSorry you had to depart Batdambang with such haste and with very little warning, but with Thai forces getting ever nearer to Batdambang it was only a matter of time before the airfield would be within artillery range and become unusable.  As you will have noticed on landing the situation here is also a little desperate.  The Thais seem to have made us their prime target recently, probably because we are covering the main actions from here and have been a considerable nuisance to them over the weeks.  We have already suffered one raid today so thought it prudent to bring you and your aircraft back home as soon as possible.  We feel almost certain the Thais will be coming back, when we don't know, so we will continue to put up standing patrols with what aircraft are still servicable, the last thing I want is for your aircraft to be caught on the ground if they return.\n\nGood look Gentlemen. Dismiss.\n\nTake off: 16:30.\nWeather: hazy.\nClouds: 1000M.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
