Description \nGogland and Kotka\n\nDate: 8th of May, 1944 \nTime: 17:00 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Krasnaia Gorka\n\nThe first week of May saw the beginning of the operation to break through the enemy lines in the Karelian Isthmus held by German and Finnish troops. The operation would push the front line away from Leningrad and take control of Vyborg.\n\nThe Baltic Fleet aviation had a big task: prevention of reinforcement of the entire enemy force in Karelia, by sea. We had to prevent virtually any ships from transferring any men or machines via Kotka and Hamina.\n\nWe launched everything whenever the weather allowed. More broken hulls were littering the bottom; our losses also mounted.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nRecon has discovered another convoy, reported as four transport and two to four escorts. The convoy has a fighter screen in the air. 8th Mine-Torpedo Division has requested an air strike focusing on the transports in the convoy. \n\nYour Target: enemy vessels in the convoy.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:00, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. The route will bring you to target with your back to the sun, thus making the flak gunners' job more difficult. The convoy is currently en route from Gogland to Kotka. Climb to 3000 m, conduct precision dive-bombing.\n\nYou will be escorted by 6 Yak-9Ds of the 21st Navy IAP.\n\n
