Description \nThe boat\n\nDate: 1st of October, 1944 \nTime: 15:00 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Yanishken\n\n "New arrivals, how's it feel up here in the North?" We would kid the Black Sea pilots. "Not quite the exclusive resort you're used to, is it? Get a cold yet?"\n\n"No wonder you guys like the Northern weather so much," they would answer. "It rains so often, you heroes barely get to fly at all!"\n\nThe new guys quickly began to feel at home, and soon enough we were all friends. They were all excellent pilots, and we all had something to learn from each other in the area of tactics. We tried some of their tricks, they learned some of ours, and the entire squadron was soon in even better shape.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nWe were scrambled in the afternoon. The first couple of planes to take off were briefed in the air, and I got my orders while running up the engines. A recon flight noticed a burning U-boat in the water, and a water plane coming in to land next to it. They may be trying to evacuate the personnel, or quite possibly repair the damage and get underway.\n\nWe need to get there as soon as possible and destroy the U-boat and her crews before they disappear. Two other planes will act as a diversion, while I have to bomb the U-boat itself.\n\nYour Target: U-boat in the Riga Bay.\n\nYour Flight: 1 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-500.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 15:00, heading north-east. Climb to 1,000 m. Stay in the cloud cover. Follow the two other Pe-2s, head towards Ventspils in formation, feint an attack on the naval base there. In the Zabeln area, split off and head North-East. Search for the U-boat North-east of Rozhen. After destroying the boat, climb to 1,200 m, hide in the cloud cover, and return home.\n\n\n
