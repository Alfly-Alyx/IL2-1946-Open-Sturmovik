Description \nKunda Bay\n\nDate: 4th of May, 1944 \nTime: 06:00 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Krasnaia Gorka\n\nThe airfields are drying up after the spring rasputitza, and both sides are launching more planes. German "wader boots", the Stuka dive-bombers, are circling over the waters, looking for our ships. Air battles begin to erupt between prowling fighters that chance upon each other. The names of the famous aces again appear in the papers. Golubev, Karpunin, Alpatov, Fedorin, other aces of the 4th Guards, the regiment that watched over us so many times.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nBaltic Fleet Intel reports another convoy out of Kunda. It is currently situated in the Narva bay, heading for the Bolshoi Tiuters island. \n\nYour Target: enemy naval convoy.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:00, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. The route will bring you to your target with your back to the sun, thus making the flak gunners' job more difficult. The convoy is currently half-way between Kunda and Bolshoi Tiuters. Climb to 3000 m, conduct precision dive-bombing.\n\nYou will be escorted by 6 Yak-9Ds of the 21st Navy IAP.\n\n
