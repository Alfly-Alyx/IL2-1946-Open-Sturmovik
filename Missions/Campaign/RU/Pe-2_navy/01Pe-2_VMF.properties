Description \nGogland Island\n\nDate: 28th of April, 1944 \nTime: 07:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Krasnaia Gorka\n\nThe third Spring of the war. By late April the Finnish Gulf began to shed the icy armor it had worn for almost six months, and the blinding white slowly changed into dull shimmering gray. Seagulls began to nest by the shore, the only creatures who'd find the cold shorelines attractive. The forests were turning black, soot-like from the air, endless expanses of naked soil with a thin mess of dark tree trunks. \n\nThe front line had receded a hundred miles South-West, and  nature again looked calm, half-dead. \n\nOur 12th Diving Guards were based at Krasnaia Gorka, the Red Hill, on the Southern shores of the Gulf. As the ice began to weaken last month, the enemy's navy increased its activities, mined the Gulf, patrolled the icy waters, and ferried men and equipment across to Kotka and Hamina. We were out there every day looking for those fat black splotches in the sea of gray.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nRecon flight has discovered a small convoy, four transports and three small escorts. They're heading from Kotka to one of the other Nazi bases in Estonia. \n\nYour Target: enemy naval convoy. \n\nYour Flight: 3 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. The route will bring you to target with your back to the sun, thus making the flak gunners' job more difficult. The convoy is currently between the islands of Bolshoi Tiuters and Gogland. Climb to 3000 m. Carry out precision dive-bombing on your targets. Recommended bomb drop altitude: 1,800 m; dive recovery altitude: 1,500 m.\n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 21st Navy IAP.\n\n
