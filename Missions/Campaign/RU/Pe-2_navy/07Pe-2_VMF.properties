Description \nVainamoinen\n\nDate: 12th of July, 1944 \nTime: 18:45 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Krasnaia Gorka\n\nWe spent most of June getting refitted. The 12th Diving Guards received 18 new flight crews, fresh out of the Levanevsky flight school. We also got 19 shiny new planes.\n\nThe veterans had a lot to do the entire time. The new kids weren't all that bad, much better than the replacements we had gotten the years before, but they were still far from battle-ready. We taught them in the classrooms and in the air, and the bomb range near the base saw a constant stream of simulated bombing runs. Most of the time we were under simulated attacks from the fighters of the 21st IAP.\n\nAnd in the second week of July, just as we began flying real combat, we received orders that would put even the veterans to the test. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAerial recon has discovered the target we've been looking for since 1939. On July 10th, the battleship Vainamoinen was photographed at the Kotka naval base.\n\nThis opportunity was too good to pass up. Two days later the entire 12th Diving Guards were ordered to locate and sink the battleship.\n\nYour Objective: sink the Vainamoinen.\n\nYour Flight: 18 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-500.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:45, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets. Initiate the bombing run from the South-West, out of the sun.\n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 21st Navy IAP.\n\n
