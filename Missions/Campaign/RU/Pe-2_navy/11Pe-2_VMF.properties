Description \nRiga Naval Base\n\nDate: 17th of September, 1944 \nTime: 16:20 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Yanishken\n\nWe made a horrible mistake planning the second strike on Liepaja yesterday. We followed the same course. The Germans knew exactly where to look for us, and the fighters they've scrambled were even deadlier the second time around.\n\nThe 16th of September was one of the darkest days for the Baltic fleet. 24 aircraft, 24 flight crews were lost over the target. For many of the dead, this was only their second combat mission. Even our CO, twice-HSU Rakov, got hit. Fortunately he managed to pilot his wounded bird away from the target, and made a crash-landing on our side of the lines.\n\nThe regiment was shattered. The morale took a near-fatal blow. The crews now considered Liepaja a deathtrap, a one-way mission.\n\nThe 21st Navy Fighter Regiment that escorted us over the Finnish Gulf and Liepaja was also decimated, and immediately sent to the rear to be refitted. For now we would be protected by the 14th Navy IAP. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nOn the 14th of September the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Baltic Fronts began their offensive. The 2nd and the 3rd are moving to retake Riga, while the 1st Front is launching a pincer movement on the right flank, aiming to cut off any Riga from the West and prevent the German Army Group North from retreating to Kurland.\n\nThe left flank of the offensive is facing a large armored force, and is attempting to prevent it from launching a counter-attack against our advancing units. \n\nThe Army Group North is partially supplied by the sea through Riga. We are assisting the offensive by striking the naval base there.\n\nYour Target: fuel storage in the Riga port.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:20, heading north-east. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets. Initiate the bombing run from the West, out of the sun. Your targets are the fuel tanks near the port.\n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 14th Navy IAP.\n\n
