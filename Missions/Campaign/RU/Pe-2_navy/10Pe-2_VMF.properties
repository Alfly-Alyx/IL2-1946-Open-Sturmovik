Description \nBack to Liepaja\n\nDate: 16th of September, 1944 \nTime: 17:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Yanishken\n\nThe losses we suffered this morning were catastrophic: five bombers and seven fighters. The survivors were stunned. We thought we were ready for it, though we knew what we were up against. Heavy flak, Focke-Wulfs, Messerschmitts: didn't we go through this a hundred times over the Finnish Gulf? Why are we taking such losses now?\n\nAt least we did some damage over Liepaja. A few cargo ships and a tanker were sunk.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nHQ believes that an immediate follow-up strike on Liepaja would be very successful due to the element of surprise. All crews are urgently ordered to prepare for the mission.\n\nYour Objective: return to Liepaja.\n\nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 14:30, heading South-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Cross the Baltic Sea South of Liepaja, then head North. Attack from the North-West, conduct dive-bombing on target. Your target is the dry cargo ship anchored at the base.\n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 21st Navy IAP.\n\n
