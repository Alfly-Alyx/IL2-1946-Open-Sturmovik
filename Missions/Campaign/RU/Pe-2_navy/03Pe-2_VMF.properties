Description \nTo Hamina\n\nDate: 7th of May, 1944 \nTime: 11:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Krasnaia Gorka\n\nThe war has its own routine. The squadron received another batch of medals, squadron leader Usenko was promoted to Guards Captain; a few others got their Red Banners. Others got killed. Some cots, some places in the flight line, emptied for a while. It's as expected. What's one plane, one man, in the life of a squadron? What's one squadron in the entire Air Force? What's one Air Force in the course of war?\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nHamina. One of the enemy's main naval bases in the Gulf. Hamina and Kotka supply most of the action in Karelia. It can't be taken out, of course, but regular air raids do peck away at the enemy here and there, keep them on their toes. There must be some effect on the fighting in the Vyborg area.\n\nYour Target: enemy vessels located at Hamina naval base.\n\nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-500.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 11:00, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. The route will bring you to your target with your back to the sun , thus making the flak gunners' job more difficult. Climb to 3000 m, Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets. Each flight will have its own target. Your flight is to attack the dry cargo transport at the center of the base.\n\nYou will be escorted by 8 Yak-9Ds of the 21st Navy IAP.\n\n
