Description \nLiepaja!\n\nDate: 28th of September, 1944 \nTime: 15:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Yanishken\n\nThe regiment received reinforcements in late September. Most of the operations by the Black Sea, way down South, were over, and most of the Black Sea Naval aviation was transferred up North. We were lucky to receive ten whole crews, all of them experienced in combat. This was a great thing for the 12th Diving Guards.\n\nBy the 26th of September, units of the Leningrad Front entered Latvia, and completely dislodged the German Narva Group out of Estonia. The entire mainland territory was ours. Some Germans remained on the islands, but the majority of them retreated to Riga.\n\nUnfortunately the 1st Baltic Front on our right flank was still not making any progress in their advance towards the Riga Bay. Meanwhile our left flank continued to weather the attacks from the enemy's armor.\n\nGermans have erected strong fortifications on the approaches to Riga. The Sigulda defensive line has multiple lines of defense manned by 31 German divisions. Our units have been attempting to break through for several days, but have not managed to achieve any progress.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAerial recon reports new convoys arriving at Liepaja. We are ordered to strike the transports before they are unloaded. \n\nYour Target: Transport vessels anchored at Liepaja.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 15:00, heading south-West. Climb to 3000 m. Cross the Baltic Sea South of Liepaja, then head North. Attack from the South, conduct dive-bombing on target. Your targets are the transports anchored at the base.\n\nYou will be escorted by 6 Yak-9Ds of the 14th Navy IAP.\n\n
