Description \nBad Weather\n\nDate: 12th of February, 1945 \nTime: 11:00 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Memel\n\nFebruary weather is notoriously bad, and we rarely got to fly. Every morning the entire squadron would be out in the cold, shoveling snow, clearing the airstrip, only to be grounded for the rest of the day and watch more snow covering up the base. \n\nThe Kurland group of enemies continued fierce resistance, despite having been surrounded for some time. They received their supplies by sea, through Liepaja and Ventspils. Well aware of our air power, most of the convoys go through at night or in bad weather.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAerial recon reports a new convoy off Liepaja. The weather let them down. It snowed all morning, but suddenly cleared up in the afternoon. Despite the low cloud cover, we are ordered to take off and strike the convoy. \n\nYour Target: enemy transport vessels.\n\nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 11:00, heading South. Climb to 3000 m, attack the target from the South. Estimated target position is marked on your maps.\n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 14th Navy IAP.\n\n
