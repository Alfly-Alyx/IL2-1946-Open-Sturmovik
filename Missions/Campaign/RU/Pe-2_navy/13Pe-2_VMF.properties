Description \nVentspils\n\nDate: 19th of September, 1944 \nTime: 06:30 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Yanishken\n\n"Those damn 'Fokkers', Devil take them!" My gunner Koreshkov got on the intercom as we landed. "Spent all my ammo on them, didn't see a single hit. What is it, black magic or something?"\n\nMy navigator was quiet, still breathing heavily almost an hour after the battle.\n\n"What the hell are you saying?" I said. "Drop that talk immediately! If those Fokkers are magical, then so are we. We didn't get hit either, did we? Besides, your job is not to shoot them down; it's to protect our plane. And you did that very well. You two kept firing the whole time and kept them at bay. We live to fight another day, and the three of us can do much more damage than some measly Focke-Wulf... All right, come on, let's get some rest. Looks like it's going to rain, don't think we'll be flying any more today."\n\nAs we were taking the breather in the rain, the 1st Baltic was still fighting. The 43rd Army tried to take Baldone throughout the day, but managed to enter it only this morning.\n\nWe were advancing in one sector, retreating in the next. Despite more reserves entering the action the offensive wasn't proceeding according to plan. The pincer was falling apart.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe city of Ventspils is located in the North-Western part of the Kurland peninsula, and is used to supply the troops throughout the region.\n\nYour Target: enemy vehicles in the port of Ventspils.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:30, heading North-east. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m, initiate the bombing run from North. Conduct dive-bombing on target. Your main targets are fuel trucks in the Southern part of the port.\n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 14th Navy IAP.\n\n
