Description \nBlack Saturday\n\nDate: 16th of September, 1944 \nTime: 14:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Yanishken\n\nThe action in the Finnish Gulf wound down by the end of August. Finland lost the battle of Karelia, gave up the city of Vyborg, and was by now practically out of the fight. Our regiment was therefore sent up to where there was more action, to the Lithuanian airfields closer to the Baltic Sea and the Riga Bay.\n\nPreparations for another large offensive were under way, this one targeting the Baltic states and Eastern Prussia.\n\nThe 12th Diving Guards, as well as the 1st Guards, 51st Mine-Torpedo, and 21st Navy Fighters were sent to the same airfield in the sector occupied by the 1st Baltic Front.\n\nWe moved in early September, quietly, hiding behind the trees. Each squadron had their own set of waypoints, trying to confuse the enemy and prevent them from recognizing the move. When we arrived, the airfield was already occupied by other regiments, and our hangars and living quarters were well prepared. We fit right in. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nOur main targets at this stage are the naval bases. These are Koenigsberg, Memel, Liepaja, Ventspils, and Riga. Liepaja is strategically the most important, as the Kurland group of Hitler's troops is mainly supplied through there. Therefore Liepaja will be our first target from our new base. \n \nYour Target: ships anchored at the Liepaja naval base.\n\nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 14:30, heading South-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Cross the Baltic Sea South of Liepaja, then head North. Attack from the North-West, conduct dive-bombing on target. Your targets are anchored around the naval base.\n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 21st Navy IAP.\n\n
