Description \nThat damned Liepaja\n\nDate: 27th of February, 1945 \nTime: 11:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Memel\n\nAs the winter of 1945 drew to a close it was becoming clear that Germany was kaput. But they refused to give up, and things were hardly getting any easier. Our ground crews had it the worst. The end of February was viciously cold, and it took inhuman effort to keep the regiment flying.\n\nOur part of the war remained static. The Germans continued to resist our advance. We launched a Kurland offensive almost a month ago, on January 26th, and barely made any progress. No one could have known that the Kurland group would continue fighting all the way until the end of the war, surrendering on May 8th.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThroughout February, we continued to strike the naval bases. The 27th was crisp and clear, and we knew we'd be flying all day, catching up for all of last week. Soon enough, we got the expected orders. Liepaja, two flights of nine.\n\nYour Target: targets of opportunity in Liepaja.\n\nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 11:00, heading South. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Initiate the bombing run from the West, Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets. \n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 14th Navy IAP.\n\n
