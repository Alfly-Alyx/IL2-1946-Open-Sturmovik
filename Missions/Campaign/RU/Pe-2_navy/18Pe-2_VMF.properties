Description \nCold Winter\n\nDate: 5th of February, 1945 \nTime: 14:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Memel\n\nOn the 5th of October, four months ago, as we were heading to Liepaja once again, a group of enemy fighters bounced us. Our Yaks must have been sleeping. They let the Focke-Wulfs make two passes at us unimpeded. The "Green Hearts" rarely miss...\n\nI didn't see them, myself. The plane suddenly jerked to the side as if hit by a giant mallet, an engine roared, and I found myself hanging in my harness, the ground rushing towards me. A battle raged below, burning hell hidden under black smoke from horizon to horizon. Fortunately, we bailed out over our lines. I noticed I was wounded just before the bone-crunching landing... \n\nI spent the next three and a half months at the hospital. The regiment fought on without me. From their new base at Memel, they struck Liepaja, Danzig, Pillau, Gdynia, and Koenigsberg. I couldn't wait to get back to my friends. A few of them were no longer there to meet me when I reported back yesterday evening.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nLiepaja remains an important strategic target to this day. Activity there is increasing, and convoys are constantly coming in and out. We are to disrupt a new convoy that is currently being loaded on transports.\n\nYour Target: warehouses and transport ships at the Liepaja naval base.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 14:00, heading South. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Initiate the bombing run from the West. Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets. Your targets are concentrated around the main pier.\n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 14th Navy IAP.\n\n
