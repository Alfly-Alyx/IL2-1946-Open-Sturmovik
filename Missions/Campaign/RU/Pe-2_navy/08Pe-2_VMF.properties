Description \nBack to Kunda\n\nDate: 25th of July, 1944 \nTime: 17:20 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Krasnaia Gorka\n\nThe first mission to Kotka failed to sink the Vainamoinen. Our commander chastised the survivors and the flight crews' morale began to sag. "Fail me another time, you'll be doing wave-top runs at 200 kph next," he told us. "Vainamoinen has to be sunk at all costs!"\n\nWe tried to analyze the battle, figure out why we failed. The crews spent three days back at the range, dropping dummy bombs on dummy ships. \n\nBy the 16th of July the weather improved, and the mission was repeated. Almost the entire Baltic Fleet Aviation took part, a hundred and fifty planes. The entire 4th GvIAP under the famous Vassily Golubev screened off enemy fighters at their airfield, Sturmoviks of the 47th ShAP hit the flak installations. Peshkas were right behind them, and the battleship was showered with dozens of 250kg bombs. A few direct hits did some damage, but the battleship was still afloat. As we were pulling up, A-20s of the 51st MTP were starting their low-level runs. \n\nWe landed and gathered in the briefing room, awaiting recon results. Few of us talked. When the news finally arrived, the fatigue disappeared, everyone jumped up, screaming. Vainamoinen was at the bottom of the sea, as well as two transport ships anchored nearby.\n\nThe higher ups were satisfied, and were not frugal with awards. Our CO Colonel Rakov got his second Hero of the Soviet Union; regiment navigator Davydov got his first, and the first squadron's leader and navigator Usenko and Kabanov got theirs too.\n\nA while later we found out that the "Vainamoinen" was actually a German cruiser Niobe, but no one cared at that point. It's not like Niobe didn't deserve to take that plunge, after all.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nMeanwhile, we continued to strike the enemy throughout the Finnish Gulf. One of the key targets was the Kunda naval base. On the 25th of June we were sent back to it.\n\nYour Target: vessels anchored at the Kunda naval base.\n\nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:20, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets. Initiate the bombing run from the West, with your back to the sun. Your flight's target is the dry cargo ship anchored at the Western pier.\n\nYou will be escorted by 8 Yak-9Ds of the 21st Navy IAP.\n\n
