Description \nRiga, Again.\n\nDate: 23rd of September, 1944 \nTime: 16:30 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Yanishken\n\nAs soon as we returned from Ventspils we received the orders to grab some 500kb bombs and fly to the Kotly airfield, back by the Finnish Gulf. The Leningrad front has reached Tallinn unexpectedly fast, and the Germans were evacuating by sea. There were plenty of big fat targets slowly floating away, and most of them were ill-defended. German fighters were rarely seen in the area any more. Our time in Tallinn was well spent. We put plenty of bombs on our targets, and began to forget about Black Saturday.\n\nSoon the units of the Leningrad front were engaged in battles in the streets of Tallinn, and by the 22nd of September the entire city was ours. We were going back to Yanishken.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAt Yanishken we still have the same tasks. In preparation of more attacks on naval installations, we will attempt to take a German airfield out of action.\n\nYour Target: Riga airfield, where German fighters are based.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:30, heading south-west. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets. Initiate the bombing run from the West, out of the sun. Concentrate on the parked fighters.\n\nYou will be escorted by 6 Yak-9Ds of the 14th Navy IAP.\n\n
