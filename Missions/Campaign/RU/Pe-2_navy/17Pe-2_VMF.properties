Description \nRiga Bay Convoy\n\nDate: 3rd of October, 1944 \nTime: 09:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Yanishken\n\nIn late September, Stavka decided to cancel the 1st Baltic's advance towards the Riga Bay, and to shift the offensive West towards Memel.\n\nA lot of the adjoining armies also had to shift mid-fight. The 2nd Baltic, continuing to attack Sigulda, had to move its 3rd Shock and 22nd Armies South and relieve the 4th and 51st Armies of the 1st Baltic. The freed-up reserves would be used by the 1st Baltic to prepare the new offensive, planned for early October.\n\nThe plan was once again to cut off the Kurland group of German defenses by striking North towards Memel, and cut them off by the Baltic Sea, preventing retreat to Eastern Prussia.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nMeanwhile, we're continuing to strike enemy naval bases and convoys. Liepaja remains our most difficult target. Last month we've lost 24 aircraft there. Losses like that can only be classified as catastrophic. Weakened and demoralized, on the 3rd we were ordered to attack a convoy that recently left Riga.\n\nYour Target: enemy transport vessels in the Riga Bay.\n\nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250 + 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 09:00, heading North-east. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets.\n\nYou will be escorted by 8 Yak-9Ds of the 14th Navy IAP.\n\n
