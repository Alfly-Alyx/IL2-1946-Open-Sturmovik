Description \nKotka\n\nDate: 11th of May, 1944 \nTime: 05:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Krasnaia Gorka\n\nWe forced the tide to turn, and the air war over the Gulf has drastically changed in our favor. The enemy abandoned large-scale operations and virtually stopped bombing our naval bases. Their tactics are now centered on hit-and-run attacks at night against our vessels at sea.\n\nThis didn't mean we, the bombers, were now on vacation. The Germans and Fins still had plenty of fighters, and when they detected large slow formations in the air, these fighters were scrambled and expertly led to us.\n\nOn my last mission the Yaks completely missed the Focke-Wulfs that pounced on us. It's a miracle more of us didn't get shot down. Most of the planes came home; but many of the men inside were dead. Yaglov, my gunner, was ripped to shreds by the Focke-Wulfs explosive shell. There are chunks of him still left in my plane, no doubt, in the hard-to-reach places. The poor ground crews who had to scrub it clean... \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nToday we've been ordered to hit the ships anchored at Kotka. Air raids against Kotka were always among the hardest. It's protected by intense, accurate flak, plenty of both 88s and small caliber guns, and there are plenty of fighters too. Every time we go to Kotka we lose a plane or two. \n\nYour Target: enemy vessels anchored at Kotka.\n\nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:00, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets. The targets are anchored in the Eastern section of the naval base. Your flight is tasked with the tanker. \n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-9Ds of the 21st Navy IAP.\n\n
