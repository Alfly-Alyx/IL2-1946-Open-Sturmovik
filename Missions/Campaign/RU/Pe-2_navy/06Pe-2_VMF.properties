Description \nSaarenpaa Battery\n\nDate: 29th of May, 1944 \nTime: 18:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Krasnaia Gorka\n\nThe brief Northern summer is almost here. It's reluctant, muted, reserved. For most of us the worst part is the myriad of mosquitoes that hover over the airfield day and night. \n\nWe're all worn out after two months of constant fighting, and the regiment is battered, weakened. We only have eight flight crews left. The Commission of the Navy Admiral Kuznetzov therefore ordered the 12th Guards back to the rear in June, to rest, get refitted and get back to full operating strength. \n\nBut that's still a few days away. For now, we still have some bombs left to drop. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe 23rd Army is busy preparing its offensive along the Korean Isthmus. Navy aircraft are striking enemy targets in-land, destroying the artillery, bunkers, and supply points.\n\nThere is a battery of big navy guns on the Saarenpaa Island, which the enemy is sure to use against out troops, once they break through towards Vygord.\n\nYour Target: Saarenpaa battery.\n\nYour Flight: 3 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nTake-off at 18:30, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3000 m. Conduct precision dive-bombing on your targets. Initiate the bombing run from the West, out of the sun.\n\nNo dedicated escort is provided. The Saarenpaa region is patrolled by 4th GvIAP fighters, which may be called in case of danger.\n\n
