You will escort Sturmoviks to Gostomel sector where they will hit road bridges and transport links.\n\nPurpose of these operations is to isolate Kiev, prior to pincer attack across the Dniepr by 1st UF, launching from our northern and southern bridgeheads.  It is critical to these operations that any attempts by the Germans to reinforce the city, or strike our spearheads from the flanks, are inhibited.\n\nEnsure Assault Aviation's attack progresses without interruption.\n\n
