Description \u0020                           ====30 GvIAP====\n\n--------------------------\nDate: 19 July 1943\n--------------------------\nTime:1135\n--------------------------\nWeather: Poor\n--------------------------\n\nOperation Kutuzov, the offensive to recapture Orel, has begun.  Now the Fascists will regret grinding themselves against our defences.  241 BAD will again bomb Orel sector.  You will escort them.\n\nEnemy air presence has reduced significantly, allowing us to increase intensity of bombing missions.  1 Fliegerdivision has now acknowledged who is the boss in the air.  Make sure the lesson is drummed into them.  If there are no fighters over the target, you may hunt for them.\n
