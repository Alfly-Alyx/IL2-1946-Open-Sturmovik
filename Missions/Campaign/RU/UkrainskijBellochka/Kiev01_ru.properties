Here the Fascists have elected to make a stand.  We shall disabuse them.\n\nYour first mission in this sector will be to escort 221 BAD in attacks against bridges in Irpen sector.  This is critical communications interchange for Kiev defenders.  VVS shall utilise our newly-acquired superiority to sever these links.  Let the Fascists feel the results of our increases in strength and confidence.\n
