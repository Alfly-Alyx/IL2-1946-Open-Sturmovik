Frontal observers have reported enemy bomber formation travelling south from Trosna.  The city of Kursk is possibly their destination.  You will mount barrier patrol at 3000 metres in order to intercept if necessary.  Follow your flight leaders at all times - they have much experience in fighting the enemy.\n\n\n\n\n\n
