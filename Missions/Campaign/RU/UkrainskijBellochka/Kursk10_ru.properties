Description \u0020                               ====30 GvIAP====\n\n--------------------------\nDate: 28 July 1943\n--------------------------\nTime:1910\n--------------------------\nWeather: Rain\n--------------------------\n\nOur forces bay at the gates of Orel.  Already the evacuation of the enemy's salient is in progress.  We cannot allow this foul weather to aid their escape.  You will interdict main roads west of Orel and strafe enemy convoys and armor.  We are on the eve of a great victory, and must look to further advances to recover the precious soil of our Motherland.\n\nDeal the Fascist occupiers one last hand of death before we move to new sectors.\n
