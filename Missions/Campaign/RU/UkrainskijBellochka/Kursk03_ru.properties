Description \u0020                           ====30 GvIAP====\n\n--------------------------\nDate: 5 July 1943\n--------------------------\nTime: 0755\n--------------------------\nWeather: Poor\n--------------------------\n\nThe enemy operation begins!  German spearheads have attacked between Trosna and Maloarchangelsk.  This is the predicted axis of attack, and so it is where our defences are most strong.  Nevetheless, their thrust is powerful, and we cannot be sure to contain them.\n\nYou will escort Sturmoviks of 299 ShAD to aid the first defensive line east of Trosna.  Keep the enemy fighters off their backs.  Reports inform us that enemy attack aircraft are also thick in the air - do not engage them unless you are sure the hunters have been dealt with.\n
