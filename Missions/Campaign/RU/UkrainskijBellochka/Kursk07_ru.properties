Description \u0020                           ====30 GvIAP====\n\n--------------------------\nDate: 9 July 1943\n--------------------------\nTime: 0615\n--------------------------\nWeather: Poor\n--------------------------\n\nThis morning you will escort 241 BAD in tactical bombing of enemy communications and storage facilities in Orel sector.  The slowing rate of advance of German offensive demonstrates not only the effectiveness of our defensive strategy, but also logistical problems that confront them.  We intend to increase these difficulties.\n\nIncompetencies of other fighter regiments in missing their liaisons will not be replicated by ourselves.  Our bomber crews are not impressed with escorts they have been provided with so far.  We shall inspire them with greater confidence.\n\n\n
