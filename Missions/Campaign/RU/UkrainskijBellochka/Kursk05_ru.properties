Description \u0020                           ====30 GvIAP====\n\n--------------------------\nDate: 7 July 1943\n--------------------------\nTime:1915\n--------------------------\nWeather: Good\n--------------------------\n\nIntensity of operations can only increase.  I know this period is difficult, but we must prevail.  You will mount dusk patrol over battlefield.  Enemy air strength seems to have lessened quite noticeably, but we can only guess at the reasons.\n\nFascist penetration of our fronts has become narrower and shallower with each passing day.  This is good.  We must keep up the attrition from the air until they stop completely.\n
