Weakness of their previous efforts indicates that their assault is at last running out of steam.  You will escort Sturmoviks who go to the aid of the defenders.  If this village holds, then the only way the enemy can go is backwards.\n\nThe enemy is also slowing in the Voronezh sector, but not by so much.  If we can stop the northern thrust, it will inspire our brothers in the south to even greater deeds of heroism.\n
