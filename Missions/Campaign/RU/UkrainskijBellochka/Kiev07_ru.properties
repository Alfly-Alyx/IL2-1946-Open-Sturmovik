Personally, I think such alcoholic ribaldry is unbecoming of both Soviet workers and a professional air force.  However, I must occasionally allow you to indulge your basest imperatives.\n\nAxis of assault has now moved towards Fastov.  We need to be nearer to front lines, so we will transfer to scorched fields at Uzin.  You will take as much ammunition as possible with your planes.  You will leave your vodka reserves here.\n
