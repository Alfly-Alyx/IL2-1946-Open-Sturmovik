Description \u0020                           ====30 GvIAP====\n\n--------------------------\nDate: 6 July 1943\n--------------------------\nTime:1020\n--------------------------\nWeather: Hazy\n--------------------------\n\nWe have stalled the enemy offensive on a line west of Ponyri.  This is despite poor performance of 16VA during yesterday's operations.  Our bomber regiments were particularly disappointing in their actions against enemy airfields.  Our boys in the trenches are showing great skill and heroism - it is time for Frontal Aviation to match them.\n\nThis morning you will conduct patrol over battlefield.  Yesterday's actions by Stukas and new twin-engined aircraft proved very effective against both Central and Voronezh fronts.  We must no longer give the Luftwaffe such an easy ride.\n
