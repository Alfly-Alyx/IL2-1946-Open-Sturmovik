VVS shall aid them in their assault.\n\nYou will escort 221 BAD to Korosten for tactical bombing of observed enemy positions.  60th Army spearheads are already on the outskirts of the city ready to begin their investment.  Let us light the way for their success.\n\nFall of Korosten will herald final success of this operation.  Unless the enemy summons significant reserves, the way to Berdichev is clear.  It is sad that you will not see the last few days.  I have orders to return you to 22 ZAP for ferrying and training operations.  May you return from this mission safely.  We need experienced pilots like yourself to bring these excellent planes and their pilots into operation.\n
