The Germans have poured reserves into our front, and are counter-attacking towards Fastov in force.  Fortunately, our brave assault crews are coming to help the defenders of of 7th Guards Tank Corps.\n\nYou will escort the Sturmoviks to the target.  On this occasion, it is equally important to inhibit the enemy's assault planes, so you may engage anything that wears the black cross of the invaders.\n\n\n
