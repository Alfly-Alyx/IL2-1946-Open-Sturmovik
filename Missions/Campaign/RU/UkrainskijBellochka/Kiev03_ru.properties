Your primary duty is to discourage enemy reconnaissance aircraft.  Even with this bad weather we cannot allow them the opportunity to observe our movements.  You will no doubt have noticed the increased activity behind our front.  Although I obviously cannot divulge any details, you can draw your own conclusions as to what is in store.\n
