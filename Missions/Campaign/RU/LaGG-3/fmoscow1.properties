Name Moscow Fighter Mission 1
Description \nType: Patrol\n\nDate: 05 October 1941\n\nTime: 3:00\n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nOn 30 September 1941, the German forces started the Moscow offensive called "Typhoon". Our capital is in danger. From the first days of war it was subject to repeated bombing raids. Bombers, using special nav equipment on the Orsha - Moscow and Smolensk - Moscow routes, have brought devastation with their incendiary and high explosive munitions. Massive daylight raids did not bring the expected results due to the intensive AA and fighter screens of Moscow's anti-aircraft defenses. The Germans turned to night tactics using small groups of bombers. The 6th Aviation Corps' reconnaissance tells us that the next raid is scheduled today. The patrol of the airspace over the Vyazma - Mozhaysk route was set up in your regiment's zone of responsibility.\n\nObjective:\n\nDo not allow the bombers to get past you to Moscow at any cost.\n\nPlayer Aircraft: Mig-3, 1940 model\n\n\n
