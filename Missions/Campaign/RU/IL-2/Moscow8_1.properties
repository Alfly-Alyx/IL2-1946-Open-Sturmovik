Description \n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nDate: 20 January 1942\n\nTime: 6:30\n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\n5th Army headquarters have approved the plan to liberate Mozhaysk. The 20th Tank Brigade and 82nd Motor Rifle Brigade in conjunction with units of the 50th and 108th Rifle Divisions will be participating. Prior to the main offensive by land troops, an aerial assault must be performed to weaken the enemy's defensive potential. A scout which has just landed has provided us with exact data on the disposition of the enemy forces. The 7th Army Corps is in the town. The eastern approaches are well fortified with artillery and AA positions. Some units are preparing for evacuation. The Corps' Headquarters are located in the train station building, heavily defended with flak guns. Vehicles are gathering around the station. The movement of the 20th Army Corps along the Protva River was also noticed. They are moving towards the front-line airfield which is located 15 km to the southwest of Mozhaysk. You are in the first task group to perform an assault on the town. The second group is storming revealed columns and the only bridge over Protva, which is of extreme importance for the retreating 20th Army Corps.\n\nObjective:\n\nPush through the lethal fire of AA batteries and obliterate the train station building and all rolling-stock in the vicinity. If necessary, help out the second task force.\n\nPlayer aircraft: IL-2, 1941 (3 series)\n\nFighter Cover: 6 Mig-3 of the 120th IAP\n\n\n
