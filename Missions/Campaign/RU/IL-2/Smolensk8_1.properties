Name Smolensk Mission 8_1
Description \n\nType: Protect\n\nDate: 16 July 1941\n\nTime: 9:52\n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nLast night, an assault on the 3rd Tank Division's positions to the south of Mogilev was carried out by our Regiment's IL-2s. None have returned. This morning, air surveillance has found lost airplanes which landed in the Gorki - Mostok region without any visible damage. The pilots no doubt lost their way in the night sky and made forced landings having run out of fuel. The landing sites are in the zone of attack of the "Grossdeutschland" Infantry Regiment, which will resume its advancement on Mstislavl in the coming hours. The loss or capture of the airplanes is unacceptable, consequently fuel trucks have been sent there without further delay.\n\nObjective:\n\nPatrol the area above the landing sites until refueling ends and the planes are in the sky. Our foe will try to capture new military gear. Protect planes from ground troop attacks if necessary. If any plane is captured - destroy it.\n\nPlayer Aircraft: IL-2, 1941 (1 series)\n\nFighter Cover: None\n\n\n
