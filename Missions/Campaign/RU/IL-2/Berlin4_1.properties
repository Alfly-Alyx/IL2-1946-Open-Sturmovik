Description \n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nDate: 2 May 1945\n\nTime: 4:46\n\nWeather: Good\n\nDescription:\n\nThe final phase of the Berlin operation is nearing its completion and the war is drawing to its logical conclusion. Scattered and uncoordinated garrisons of Berlin defenders have no power to fend off the storming of the city by the troops of the Red Army, but are resisting desperately. We have just received the message from the 3rd Assault Army headquarters that a group of German tanks escorting two staff columns has penetrated the defenses in the 52nd Guards Rifle Division sector. They are now moving past the northwestern suburbs of Berlin towards the offensive positions of the 2nd American Army of the Allies. There is a possibility that this tank group is evacuating Hitler and High Command staff of the Third Reich from the besieged city.\n\nObjective:\n\nDestroy all of the escaping staff columns and if possible the escorting tanks.\n\nPlayer Aircraft: IL-2 Type 3M, 1943\n\nFighter Cover: 4 La-7 of the 9th Gv.IAP\n\n\n
