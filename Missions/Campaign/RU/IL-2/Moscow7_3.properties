Description \n\nType: Recon\n\nDate: 2 January 1942\n\nTime: 14:25\n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nThe Red Army's counter-offensive which began on 6 December 1941 has left the German Army no chance of conquering Moscow. Between the 11 and 20th December, Istra, Solnechnogorsk, Klin and Volokolamsk were recaptured. Under unstoppable bombardment, the enemy is continuing to retreat with chains of columns stretching out to the west, leaving the ashes of ruins behind. Every wave of Sturmoviks over the enemy columns brings terror into the souls of the German soldiers, who are now calling it "Schwarzer Tod", which means "the Black Death".\nThe liberation of Maloyaroslavets, held by the remnants of the 57th Panzer and 12th Army Corps of the Wehrmacht, has been accomplished by the 53rd and 17th Rifle Divisions with the support of the 26th Tank Brigade of the 43rd Army. By double-enveloping from north and south, they are encircling the city to attack the undefended flanks of the retreating auto columns which are departing to Medyn. The retreat is covered by fighters operating from the airfield to the southwest of Medyn.\n\nObjective:\n\nScout the Medyn airfields, because according to unverified data, reinforcements may be sent to one of them.\n\nPlayer aircraft: IL-2, 1941 (3 series)\n\nFighter Cover: None\n\n\n
