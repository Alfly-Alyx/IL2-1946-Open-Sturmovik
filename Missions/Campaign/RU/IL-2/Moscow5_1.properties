It is protected by the units of the 33rd Army. On 1 December 1941, formations of the enemy's 7th, 20th Army Corps and 57th Panzer Corps struck into the zone of responsibility of the 222nd and 11th Rifle Divisions. In case of a successful offensive by the 4th Army to the north of Naro-Fominsk, the enemy will have the chance to come to the rear of the 33rd Army. Covering the southern approaches to Kubinka, the 32nd Rifle Division have engaged the overwhelming enemy forces which are intended to break through to Golitzyn. Divisional artillery have repelled the first tank wave. If our forces are not supported from the air properly, enemy backup on the Naro-Fominsk - Kubinka road will wipe them out and take the bridgeheads to continue the assault on Moscow.\n\nObjective:\n\nWeaken enemy forces on the road to Kubinka. Do not let them past the 32nd Rifle Division.\n\nPlayer aircraft: IL-2, 1941 (2 series)\n\nFighter Cover: None\n\n\n
