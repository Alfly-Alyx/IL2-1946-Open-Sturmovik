Name Stalingrad mission 5
Description \n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nDate: 30 November 1942\n\nTime: 15:00\n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nOur forces' successful counterstrike on the 19th of November according to the Operation Uranus plan and the subsequent blocking of the German Armies have contributed to the total encirclement of the enemy in Stalingrad. Supplies to the surrounded forces are provided by air-lifts from transport aircraft and bombers which are operating from airfields near the city. Based on data provided by the headquarters of the 228th ShAD, the most valuable is the Pitomnik airfield. It is receiving considerable amounts of food, medical supplies and ammunition daily. For a quick suppression of hostile resistance in the city, we need to eliminate this air-lift.\n\nObjective:\n\nThe main objective is the elimination of transport planes on the ground and readying for take-off. Also destroy any support vehicles if possible.\n\nPlayer Aircraft: IL-2M, 1942 (later series)\n\nFighter Cover: 4 LaGG-3 of the 296th IAP\n\n\n
