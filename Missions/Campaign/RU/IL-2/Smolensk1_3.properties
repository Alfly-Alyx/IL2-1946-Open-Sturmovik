Name Smolensk Mission 1
Description \n\nType: Training\n\nDate: 04 July 1941\n\nTime: 6:00\n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nFor the purposes of flight evaluation and finding the best way to use the new IL-2 planes for combat, you have been assigned to the newly formed 430th Assault Aviation Regiment (ShAP) and dispatched to the front among the 23rd Mixed Air Division of the Western front. There, you will help our 20th, 21st and 22nd armies hold off the onslaught of the German "Center" Army Group whose Operation "Barbarossa" is advancing. Over the last three days, strategically important bridgeheads around the cities of Ulla, Disna, Lepel, Borisov and Bobruysk have fallen to the enemy. Near Rogachev, the 24th Panzer Corps has already reached the Dnepr River. Consequently, conditions were favorable for further offensive attacks by the hostile 2nd and 3rd Panzer Groups in the directions of Vitebsk and Orsha.\nRecently-received planes are to be test-flown, and your qualifications as a Sturmovik pilot are to be confirmed. There is a small firing range with captured vehicles to the south of our airfield. You are to show your piloting skills and bombing accuracy on this new type of plane. There is a possibility of the presence of enemy fighters in the air because of our close proximity to the frontline.\n\nObjective:\n\nDestroy soft-skinned trophy vehicles on testing grounds. If you have enough ammo, you can try out harder targets.\n\nPlayer Aircraft: IL-2, 1941 (1 series)\n\nFighter Cover: 2 I-16 of the 161st IAP (Fighter Aviation Regiment)\n\n\n
