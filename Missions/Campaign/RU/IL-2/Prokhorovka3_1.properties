Name Prokhorovka mission 3
Description \n\nType: Ground Attack\n\nDate: 12 July 1943\n\nTime: 13:40\n\nWeather: Hazy\n\nDescription:\n\nBy noon, it was already clear to German High Command that a frontal assault on the Red Army from Prokhorovka could not be achieved. Having suffered great losses in men and vehicles, the enemy decided to force the Psel River and get to the rear of the 5th Guards Army. For this purpose, 11th Panzer Division and units of the "Toten Kopf" SS Division, which have already moved in the Oboyan direction and penetrated the defenses of the 12th Guards Rifle Division, were brought into battle. One of the possible ways to get over the river is the bridge to the northwest of Prokhorovka. Weakened by previous fighting, the units of the 18th Tank Corps took defenses in front of the bridge. They will not hold off the enemy for long, because hostile formations are being led by the new "Panther" and heavy "Tiger" tanks.\n\nObjective:\n\nStop the heavy tank formations moving towards the Psel River.\n\nPlayer Aircraft: IL-2 Type 3, 1943\n\nFighter Cover: 4 Yak-1B of the 270th IAP\n\n\n
