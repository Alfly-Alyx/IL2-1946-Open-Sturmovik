Having broken through the outer front-line defense perimeter, Mansteins Group forced the Aksai River and is moving towards the 4th mechanized and the 13th Tank Corps, who are taking defensive near Vasilievka settlement. The movement of the German 6th army on the Aksai - Vasilievka road to the northwest was noticed by the reconnaissance of the 13th Tank Corps. The advancement of the enemy is endangering the front-lines in this sector because the 2nd Guards Army, under the command of the General Malinovskiy which is being transferred there, is not on schedule to support the insufficiently defended positions of the 4th and 13th Corps due to the blizzards.\n\nObjective:\n\nSupport the defenses of our forces in the endangered direction.\n\nPlayer Aircraft: IL-2M, 1942 (later series)\n\nFighter Cover: None\n\n\n
