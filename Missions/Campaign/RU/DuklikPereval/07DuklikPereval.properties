Description \nOver the Mountain Passes\n\nDate: 13th of September, 1944 \nTime: 05:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nThe Germans concentrated a large force in the Carpathians. Two Soviet Fronts were opposed by two German Armies, the 1st Panzer and the 1st Hungarian. They consisted of 10 German and 8 Hungarian divisions of 4 to 10 thousand men each; and 2 Hungarian mountain brigades. The entire German force had 300,000 men, 3,250 guns and mortars, up to 100 tanks and SPA, and 450 aircraft.\n\nOn the other side, Stavka dedicated three mixed armies, and two separate infantry, 1 armored and 1 cavalry corps to the fight. They were made up of 34 infantry divisions of 4.5 to 6 thousand men, 3 infantry and 3 armored brigades, and 2 air armies. The Soviet Eastern Carpathian force had 246,000 men, 5,140 guns and mortars, 322 tanks and 1,165 aircraft. Thus, the Red Army had 3.2 times the tanks, 1.5 times the artillery, and 2.5 times the aircraft, while having an overall numerical inferiority.\n\nOn the first day of the offensive, the 38th Army broke through the German defenses along a 12-km wide front, and advanced by as much as 12 km during the first day. However the Germans soon shifted three fresh divisions, including two armored, to counter-attack. The Soviet advance halted.\n\nThe 1st Guards Army, which went on the offensive on the 9th at Sanok, came up against very strong defenses. Within 4 days, it only managed to advance by 15 km along a 30-km front.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\n1st Guards Army units, reinforced by tanks and SPA, are engaged in heavy fighting for every road, for every village. Germans are expertly maneuvering their forces and withdrawing front-line units to prepared defensive positions. HQ received information that a Panzer division is currently moving toward the 1st Guards sector. It is imperative that the move is disrupted, and the German tanks destroyed before they can enter the fight.\n\nAerial reconnaissance has just reported back that a column of enemy tanks, as well as supply vehicles, are moving from Vyidran through Radoshice towards Bukovsko.\n\nYour Objective: locate and destroy the German armored column.\n\nYour Flight: 4 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: 96 PTAB-2.5 + 4BRS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:30, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. HQ also requested that the flight pass over Bukovsko to increase the morale of our troops. Stay at 1,300-1,500 m. The mountains are currently covered with low-level fog that may obscure your targets. Flying along the Vyidran - Radoshice road, stay at 300 - 500 m.\n\nYour cover will be a zveno of La-5FN of 113th GvIAP.\n\n\n
