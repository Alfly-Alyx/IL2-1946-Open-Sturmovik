Description \nRealistic Training\n\nDate: 31st of August, 1944 \nTime: 07:00 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nWorking over the mountains has its specifics. In the early morning, ground visibility is low due to fog. Locating and positively identifying targets may be almost impossible in these conditions. Even during the day, targets just a few hundred meters above sea level may be obscured by clouds. There, air mass over the mountains is also more treacherous than elsewhere. Rapid air currents cause almost constant turbulence, often severe, and thus staying at lower altitudes is much more dangerous. Therefore Sturmoviks have to fly at higher altitudes and airspeeds than normal, and their accuracy is often reduced.\n\nIt is, therefore, crucial to become familiar with these conditions. We are fortunate to have a lull in the fighting, which allows us to train in realistic weather conditions. We are continuing to gather captured and abandoned German vehicles, and set them up as targets at the Chudec range. This time the targets will also include flak guns.\n\nYour Objective: conduct gunnery, bombing and rocket firing practice.\n\nYour Flight: 2 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-50 + 4 RS-82\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Recommended altitude is 1200 m. Your targets will be concentrated around the central circle. Make the first pass with bombs, aiming to put them all within the circle. Fire rockets and on-board armament on your second pass. \n\n
