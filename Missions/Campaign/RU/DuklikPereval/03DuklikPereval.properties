Description \nExtra Reconnaissance\n\nDate: 2nd of September, 1944 \nTime: 10:20 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nStavka assigned Czechoslovakia as the target of three large army groups, the 1st, 2nd and 4th Ukrainian Fronts. During their offensive operations, the 2nd Ukrainian managed to contact the Carpathian group of German units from the rear. Thus a possibility opened to strike into Czech territory without having to wade over the Carpathian mountains. On the 26th of August, Stavka ordered the 4th Ukrainian to halt its advance, and to dig in at the currently occupied positions.\n\nHowever, the plans soon had to be changed. On the 30th of August several Czech defectors reported a large-scale rebellion against occupying Germans. One of the defectors was a senior officer of the Czech air force, the commander of the East Slovakian Air Corps colonel Talski. He reported that, in the case of a Soviet advance towards Krosno, the 1st and 2nd Slovakian divisions would join the fight on our side.\n\nOn the 31st of August, the Czech embassy in Moscow, represented by the Consul General Firlinger and military attach\u00E9 Pika, formally requested Soviet military help with their rebellion. Stavka decided to urgently review their plans and assist the Czech forces before their rebellion was crushed.\n\nAn offensive on Eastern Carpathians rapidly began to take shape.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nHQ requests urgent information on enemy positions. They require updated positions of enemy units, the state of the fixed defenses, as well as locations of warehouses and supply depots.\n\nYour Objective: conduct additional reconnaissance.\n\nYour Flight: 2 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 RS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:20, heading South-East.
