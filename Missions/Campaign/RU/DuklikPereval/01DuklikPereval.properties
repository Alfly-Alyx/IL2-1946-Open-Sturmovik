Description \nTarget Practice\n\nDate: 30th of August, 1944 \nTime: 07:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nThe Lvov - Sandomir Operation was completed in the summer of 1944. In the process, the 1st Ukrainian Front defeated German units in the Ukraine and liberated Western Ukraine and South-Western Poland. On the 29th of August, Stavka ordered the 1st Ukrainian to halt its advance and dig in. Germans saw this as an opportunity to retake some of the lost territory and began amassing reinforcements behind the new frontline. \n\nA month earlier, in July of 1944, Stavka had detached several units from the 1st Ukrainian, creating a new 4th Ukrainian Front. The 4th Ukrainian was given a new objective, the Carpathians. Throughout August, the 4th Ukrainian Front was engaged in heavy fighting, slowly advancing towards the mountains. German fortifications were well organized, and they expertly conducted defensive operations and rapidly shifted their units along the frontline to hold back the Red Army. The Carpathian region was an important stronghold, and they were willing to hold it at all costs. However, they were grossly outnumbered, and despite all efforts were forced to continue their retreat. The Red Army, tattered in the fight, ground to a halt in some sectors by mid-August, and began to draw in reinforcements, hoping to continue the offensive soon.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nOur 525th Sturmoviks rebased to Bzhozuv last week, near Krosno. We were a part of the 227th Sturmovik Division, 8th Air Army.\n\nPreparations are currently underway for a South-West offensive, towards Czechoslovakia. Our main task is to prepare for operations over mountainous terrain, and to gather Intel data on enemy positions.\n\nFor the past four days we've been conducting training missions at a nearby Chudec range, attacking derelict German vehicles. This is as close to the real thing as we ever had.\n\n \nYour Objective: conduct gunnery training using on-board armament.\n\nYour Flight: 1 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:30, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Recommended altitude is 1200 m. Learn to attack from that altitude, as 1,200-1,500 m is, in our experience, the most common at the front. Your targets will be abandoned German vehicles.\n\n
