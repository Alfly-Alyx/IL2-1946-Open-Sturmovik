Description \nBack for Seconds\n\nDate: 11th of September, 1944 \nTime: 13:25 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nAfter our morning strike, the tanks finally made it through to Dluge. With infantry support, they tried to take the village head-on, but were met with withering fire from artillery guns and stationary tanks camouflaged within the buildings. The commanders on the ground decided to continue the advance around Dluge, and deal with the surrounded German units by air strikes and artillery.\n\nYour Objective: neutralize German defenders at Dluge.\n\nYour Flight: 4 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-100 + 4 BRS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 13:25 heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Recommended altitude is 1,100-1,300 m. Currently the visibility over Dluge is limited, due to ground smoke and fog. Target recognition may be difficult and sometimes impossible. Therefore, you are not cleared to engage targets outside the immediate borders of the town. Areas outside of town may contain friendly troops.\n\n
