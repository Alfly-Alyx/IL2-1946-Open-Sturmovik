Description \nThe Offensive Begins\n\nDate: 11th of September, 1944 \nTime: 11:25 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nThe 1st and 2nd Ukrainian Fronts fought continuously throughout the summer, and by late August were understrengh, exhausted and low on supply and morale. The men needed to rest. However the rapidly developing situation in Slovakia demanded immediate action, and Stavka was relentless.\n\nThe 1st and 4th Ukrainian Fronts completed their planning by the first week of September. The 1st Ukrainian would aim to break through at Krosno with a powerful strike made up of the 38th Army, the 25th tank corps, 1st Guards Cavalry Corps and the 1st Czech Army Corp, as well as engineer and artillery units. The entire strike would be concentrated on an 8 km-wide stretch of the front.\n\nThe 38th army would strike along the Krosno - Duklia road, which was the shortest paved route to Slovakia. The operation was planned to take 5 days and advance by 90 to 95 km. On the third day of the advance the 1st and 2nd divisions of the Eastern Slovakian corps would strike out towards the 38th army, and aim to link up by the 5th day.\n\nThe Commander of the 4th Ukrainian Front, General Petrov, issued a directive which assigned the 1st Guards Army to strike along a 4-km front near Sanok, and continue advancing towards Komancha.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe 4th Ukrainian went on the offensive on the 9th of September. The first two days, the bad weather kept all Sturmoviks grounded. Only this morning did the sky begin to clear up, and the Sturmovik regiments finally began to take to the air. The 525th ShAP is ordered to support the 1st Guards Army advance in the Sanok region. The heaviest fighting is currently near the village of Dluge.\n\nOur infantry units have just been counter-attacked by enemy armor near Dluge. Infantry was forced to retreat to the left bank of the Dluge River. A formation of T-34-85s is unable to assist them, as the bridge it needs to cross to reach them is in direct line of enemy artillery fire. The offensive is temporarily halted, until the artillery is dealt with. Several sorties from the 525th have already been sent to the area.\n\nYour Target: enemy artillery.\n\nYour Flight: 4 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-50 + 4 RS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 11:25, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Stay at 1,100 - 1,200 m. \nThe conditions near Dluge are difficult, and are exacerbated by turbulence and fog. Artillery positions known to us are marked on your maps. It is possible additional targets are spread across the area, likely within Dluge itself. \n\n
