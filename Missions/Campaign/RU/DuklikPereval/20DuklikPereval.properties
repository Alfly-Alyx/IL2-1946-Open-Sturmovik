Description \nOver the Russki Gorge\n\nDate: 26th of September, 1944 \nTime: 07:30 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, the 1st Guards Army began advancing towards Eastern Carpathian mountains. The breakthrough and rapid advance along the outlying plains are imminent.\n\nGermans have prepared strong defenses in the region, supported by plenty of artillery, assault guns, tanks and other armored vehicles. Heavy fighting is expected.\n\nThe weather has worsened in the past several days, and fog and rain is almost a constant factor. This makes re-supply of our units more difficult, and slows down their advance.\n\nDespite the bad weather, you are ordered to continue supporting our advancing units.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nAfter a brief artillery barrage brought on by the shortage of shells, our tanks and SPAs began moving toward the Russki ridge. The enemy met them with a hurricane of fire. HQ demands air strikes on enemy guns along the front line.\n\nThe warehouse is out of BZT-37 shells for the NS-37 cannon, therefore IL-2 Type 3M is temporarily grounded.\n\nYour Target: enemy defenses near the Russki ridge.\n\nYour Flight: 12 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-100 + 4 BRS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:30, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Recommended altitude is 1,200 m. It is imperative that you destroy as many enemy guns as possible. Concentrate on targets that are currently firing at our units. Enemy positions are expected to be well defended against an air attack. \nThe mission will be made even more difficult by the adverse weather. Good Luck!\n\n
