Description \nTanks in the Forest\n\nDate: 23rd of September, 1944 \nTime: 14:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nIn the two weeks since the offensive started, the 113th GvIAP suffered heavy losses in both aircraft and pilots. More planes were lost to weather-related accidents and flak than to air-to-air combat. Therefore, fighter cover may be unavailable during the next few days.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nDespite a series of air strikes, the enemy managed to concentrate their armor near Olka. HQ orders more air strikes on their positions, aiming to destroy the armor before it can engage our forces.\n\nThe 1st Guards Army ground observers report some of the tanks to be located near the forest West of Olka.\n\nYour Objective: locate and destroy enemy armor.\n\nYour Flight: 2 Il-2 Type 3\u041C.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-100 + 4 BRS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 14:30, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Recommended altitude is 1100-1300 m. After arriving over Olka, make several circles over the area, mapping out troop concentrations. Upon finding the most attractive target, commence your attack. \n\n
