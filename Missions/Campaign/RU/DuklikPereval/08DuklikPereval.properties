Description \nBattle of Bukovsko\n\nDate: 14th of September, 1944 \nTime: 18:00 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nThe initial plans for a five-day advance did not come to fruition. German defenders were much more determined than we expected. The offensive was subsequently divided into two, the Carpathian-Duklino, and Carpathian-Uzhgorod.\n\nThe 38th Army, which was advancing towards Duklino, continued to throw itself against the German defenses, but was only able to break through after the 10th of September when the 1st Ukrainian Front reinforced it with the 4th Guards Tank Corps.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nBy the 14th of September the 1st Guards Army was finally able to reach Bukovsko. However taking the town was a different manner. Bukovsko was well-defended with artillery, tanks and machine guns.\n\nHQ requests air strikes on German positions.\n\nYour Target: Bukovsko.\n\nYour Flight: 8 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-50 + 4 RS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:00, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Recommended altitude is 1,000-1200 m.\n\nOn approach to target, split off the second flight for attack on enemy flak guns.\n\nSearch for targets visually; the main priority is armored vehicles and artillery. Our tanks are currently attempting to encircle Bukovsko, so do not fire on any vehicles outside of town without positively identifying them first.\n\nYou will be escorted by 6 La-5FN of 113th GvIAP.\n\n
