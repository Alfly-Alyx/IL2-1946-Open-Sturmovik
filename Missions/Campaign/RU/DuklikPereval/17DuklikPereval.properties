Description \nThe Kashkovtse Affair\n\nDate: 23rd of September, 1944 \nTime: 07:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nThe intensity of fighting is currently decreasing in the sector controlled by the 1st Guards Army. The right flank is regrouping in the direction of Vyidran, amassing reserves at Gumenne. However moving troops and supplies is complicated due to poor road conditions as well as adverse weather.\n\nOn the left flank, our troops have the approaches to the Russki ridge. Taking this strategically important location will allow to outflank Germans at Gumenne, and enter European plains where an armored offensive is much easier.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThe enemy's supply situation is equally complex in the rear, and even more difficult due to our unchallenged air superiority. We have the opportunity to completely neutralize German attempts to reinforce and re-supply their front line at Gumenne.\n\nThe regiment has received only four Il-2 3M, armed with 37mm cannon. Your squadron is the most experienced and, therefore, you are entrusted with this new weapon. State trials declare that a NS-37 shell, as mounted in the IL-2, can destroy armored vehicles such as StuG 40, StuG IV Pz. III Ausf L/M and Pz. IV Ausf G/H, with up to 30mm of armor at a distance of 500 m, and a dive angle of 5 to 10 degrees at 100 meters of altitude. The attack should be conducted from the rear or from the side, and cannon should be fired in short bursts of 3 shells maximum at the tank's rear.\n\nThe first sortie for the new planes is scheduled for today. Intel reports new formations of enemy tanks moving from Gumenne towards Olka. The column's current projected location is in the village of Kashkovtse.\n\nYour Target: enemy armored column at Kashkovtse.\n\nYour Flight: 2 Il-2 Type 3\u041C.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:30, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Recommended altitude is 1,100-1,300 m. Concentrate on enemy tanks. Fire in a shallow dive, dropping combat flaps, and aiming at the tank's aft quarter at close distances.\n\nYour fighter cover will be provided by 6 La-5FN of 113th GvIAP.\n\n
