Description \nRadoshice HQ\n\nDate: 17th of September, 1944 \nTime: 19:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nFlight leaders of the 113th GvIAP have been court-martialed for leaving their package and chasing a pair of German fighters on 15th of September. Their negligence caused more than merely the loss of Sturmoviks; it also disrupted overall Stavka plans for the entire sector.\n\nAll pilots there are asked to watch out for the following German tactic: a pair of fighters will distract the escort, and a larger group will then hit-and-run the bombers. The 8th Air Army orders all remaining pilots to maintain discipline in the air, to stay vigilant, and to concentrate on their objectives at all times.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThe 4th Ukrainian Front orders the 1st Guards Army to go on the offensive immediately, take control of Radoshice and cross into Czechoslovakian territory. Sturmoviks are ordered to increase the number of sorties, and conduct more strikes on enemy roadways and defensive positions up to 50 km behind the front line.\n\nIntel suggests that the headquarters of a German division is located in the church on the Eastern outskirts of Radoshice. The 525th ShAP is given the objective.\n\nYour Target: German division HQ in Radoshice.\n\nYour Flight: 4 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: 6 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 19:00, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Recommended altitude is 1,100-1,300 m. Begin your attack run after passing the Yasliska road. Descend to 500 m, and approach Radoshice behind the mountain range. This will give your attack an element of surprise. Destroy the church.\n\n
