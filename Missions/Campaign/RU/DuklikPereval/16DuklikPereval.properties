Description \nBridge over Laborec\n\nDate: 22nd of September, 1944 \nTime: 18:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Bzhozuv\n\nDuklia was taken on the 20th of September by the forward units of the 38th Army, under General Moskalenko and the tanks of the 4th Guards Tank Corps. Our forces are regrouping, preparing a renewed offensive toward the Duklia ridge.\n\nOn the 21st of September, the 1st Guards Army took Vyidran. Its offensive will continue along the Czech territory, towards the Russki ridge.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nHitler's High Command fully understands the gravity of the situation, and tries desperately to halt the 1st Guards' advance into Czechoslovakia. Intel reports suggest that two fresh German divisions are moving towards the Russki ridge. The town of Gumenne is an important junction along their route. In order to halt their arrival, HQ ordered a strike on the bridge over the Laborec River near Gumenne. \n\nSeveral sorties have already been undertaken by Sturmoviks and medium bombers, but the bridge remains intact. The task is made more difficult by the target's distance from the front line, a large concentration of flak guns in the area, and fighters from a nearby German airfield.\n\nYour Objective: destroy the Laborec bridge.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Il-2 Type 3.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:00, heading South-East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Recommended altitude is 1200 m. Stay below 330 kph, and let the second flight overtake you, then let them make at least one pass at enemy flak before approaching. Commence attack runs from the direction of the sun. After attacking the bridge, return home at full speed. Keep your eyes peeled for enemy fighters.\n\n
