Description \nThe Eve of Battle\n\nDate: 29th of June, 1943 \nTime: 18:40 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nAll three of us, Govorov, Zaichenkov and myself, were recommended for an award after we bagged those 109s. We knew the recommendation might take a while to turn around. We were in the middle of a huge fight.\n\nIn early June we ran into more unexpected problems. As we began flying more ground attack missions, some planes would return home with inexplicable damage to the wings. After a while, we found out it was a manufacturing defect. Wing panels weren't holding on to the wing struts, and would shear off at high speeds or during extreme maneuvers. The news spread like wildfire, and led to a near-catastrophic situation. Across the entire front, pilots were afraid to fly their Yaks, and when we did, we were reluctant to take the planes to their limit. \n\nThe news quickly reached Stalin himself, and the results were immediate. An investigation concluded the problem was in the primer used on all Yak plants. It was made of inferior materials, and under adverse weather conditions, would crack and weaken the metal. A few heads rolled, and rapid response repair teams were created all along the front, which quickly remedied the problem.\n\nBy the end of June, enemy activity began to wind down. Air battles became rarer. Most of the German planes we saw now flew in small groups.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nZolotuhino airfield is expecting a Li-2 transport plane tonight, bringing in inspectors from the Front HQ. The transport is protected by La-5s of the 176th IAP. The escort was supposed to be a routine, a formality. Enemy planes were rarely seen that far behind our lines. However, after passing Maloarchangelsk, the escort leader reported being under attack. Due to inexperience or bad luck, the La-5s committed themselves to those FW-190s and let their Li-2 out of their sight. The FW-190s left the engagement, but the Li-2 with its VIP passengers was completely defenseless.\n\nYour Objective: Take off immediately, meet the Li-2 and escort it to Zolotuhino.\n\nYour Flight: 4 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake off at 18:40, heading North-West. Proceed at full throttle towards Olkhovatka. Locate the Li-2 and escort it back to Zolotuhino.\n\n
