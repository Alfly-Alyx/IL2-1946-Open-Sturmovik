Description \nThe duel\n\nDate: 29th of May, 1943 \nTime: 03:45 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nWe received a new set of operating instructions from the 16th Air Army. Each squadron would have planes in varying states of readiness; and two planes and pilots should remain at Readiness Level One at any given time. Readiness Level One meant a take-off within 60 seconds of our HQ receiving the order. Thus, all our pilots took shifts sitting in cockpits for four hours at a time, 24 hours a day, regardless of weather conditions or any other factors.\n\nOn the 29th of May, I had the 2 am - 6 am shift with Captain Kostrov.\n\nKostrov outranked me, had almost 6,000 hours under his belt, but had little combat experience. He had been a flight instructor until April of this year, when his application was finally accepted, and he was sent to the front. He didn't quite fit in. He was a good pilot, that's for sure, but he was too old, too inflexible. He still flew like it was 1939, and instead of learning from our first-hand experience, he would get into long arguments trying to prove that the old ways were better. The CO had somehow gotten wind of it, and for the past few days, Kostrov was assigned to fly my wing. Neither of us liked it, but we had little choice. I had a feeling I'd be the one protecting his six in a fight, instead of the other way around.\n\nDawn was creeping up as I began to doze off...\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nScramble, scramble! Observers near Kursk report a high-altitude single aircraft over the city. It is assumed to be an enemy recon plane. Take off, locate, and visually identify the target. If it is hostile, shoot it down.\n\nYour Objective: intercept the unidentified target over Kursk.\n\nYour Flight: 2 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 03:45, heading North-West. Continue to climb after take-off, proceed to J7, then turn South to J4, climbing to 4,000 m. Locate the target visually. Interception of a possible recon is of highest priority; several strategic convoys are being offloaded at Kursk railway station, and their discovery should be avoided at all costs.\n\n
