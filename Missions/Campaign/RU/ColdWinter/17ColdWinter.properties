Description \nStriking Trosna\n\nDate: 3rd of May, 1943 \nTime: 16:20 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nThe Intel we gathered was rapidly sent up all the way to Rokossovski himself. It was clear that the Germans were concentrating significant armored forces in an around Trosna. Tanks, SPA, APCs, fuel, ammunition, support vehicles - there was plenty of everything there. This was too good of a target to pass up.\n\nThe importance of the Kursk Salient was indisputable for both sides. For the Germans, encircling our troops in salients like that was a favorite tactic. They would concentrate their forces on the two flanks, then simultaneously strike towards each other and cut off our forces inside the salient. Our Central Front had the dubious honor of being the salient, the main target of expected German onslaught. Weakening the Germans before the offensive was, therefore of crucial importance.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nArmy HQ is ordering an immediate strike on enemy armor at Trosna. A flight of Sturmoviks is taking off. 519th and 176th IAPs will escort them to target.\n\nYour Objective: join a pair of Yak-1Bs of the 176th IAP in escorting Il-2s to their target and back. \n\nYour Flight: 2 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:20, heading North-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Continue to climb after take-off, proceed to Stanovoe. Head towards Ponyri, where you'll rendezvous with your package. Follow the hunchbacks, watch the airspace. Immediate cover will be provided by Yak-1Bs of the 176th IAP. Your task is to cover them from a German bounce, as well as protect the package itself.\n\n
