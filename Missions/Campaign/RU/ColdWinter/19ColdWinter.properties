Description \nIntercepting the bombers.\n\nDate: 17th of May, 1943 \nTime: 07:00 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nBy the second half of May, our tasks became even more complicated. Especially confusing were aerial recon missions. The enemy seemed to have disappeared. All those tanks, all those trucks and men, they were suddenly nowhere to be found. I even began to think the whole German thing was a feint designed to draw our forces away from the real German offensive.\n\nThe rumor was that the real offensive was happening near Kharkov. German phone lines in our sector were quiet, but around Kharkov, they were bursting with voices. A few defectors came over to us, all reporting that Kharkov would be the main German target. \n\nI took Govorov out a few more times. He was learning fast, and our mutual trust increased after every fight. Other officers didn't approve; they thought I was taking too much of a risk entrusting my six to a rookie. But I had more faith in Alexei than in any of them. He had lightning-fast reactions, incredible situation awareness, could handle Gs better than me. Just a little more experience, and I'd have the best wingman in the air force.\n\nOur CO, Deryagin, flew with us every now and then. He had seven kills to his credit, and I suppose he wanted more. Or maybe he was just trying to escape from the Commissar for a few hours a day. The atmosphere in their dugout was becoming staler each time I walked in there.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nObservers along the front line are reporting an enemy bomber formation heading for Kursk. They are estimated at 10 to 12 bombers, and 4 escorts. Air Army HQ is sending Aircobras of the 129th IAP to intercept the escorts, and Yak-1Bs of the 519th to hit the bombers. Their most likely target is the Kursk railway station where large quantities of fuel and ammunition are warehoused. Its destruction would be devastating. \n\nYour Objective: prevent enemy bombers from striking Kursk.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00, heading North-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. After take-off, head towards Stanovoe, then turn to Olkhovatka, climbing to 4,000 m. Visually search for bombers.\n\n
