Description \nWeakness\n\nDate: 30th of May, 1943 \nTime: 05:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nVictory in war is achieved on many levels. The most basic and the most essential one is supplies. If the supplies aren't there, no amount of planning or personal bravery can prevail. Thus, it is crucial that supplies arrive on time; and when it has to happen on a giant scale like at Kursk, it's no small feat. Dozens of trains, hundreds of cars, thousands of items arrive to dozens of stations every hour, and they all need to be met, offloaded, and then the supplies loaded in trucks and diverted to correct destinations. This would be a challenging undertaking even if there were no enemy planes in the air, trying to disrupt the carefully laid out plans with bombs.\n\nKursk was the central junction in the entire undertaking. This is where most of the armor, infantry, fuel, ammunition and food passed through. The station was a giant thorn in the German's side.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nObservers along the front line are reporting a large formation of twin-engine aircraft, and another of single-engines above it, proceeding on course towards Kursk. Their most likely target is the Kursk railway station. \n\nYour Objective: intercept the enemy formation. Prevent any bombs from falling on the Kursk railway station.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Yak-1B of the 519th IAP and 4 La-5F, 165th IAP, 286th IAD. \n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nLa-5Fs assigned to your mission took off at 04:50. They will engage and isolate German escorts. Your Yak-1Bs will take-off at 05:00, heading North-West, then proceed towards Fatezh. Then, climbing to 4,000 m, proceed to quadrant G4. Your Yaks must prevent enemy bombers from reaching their target. \n\n
