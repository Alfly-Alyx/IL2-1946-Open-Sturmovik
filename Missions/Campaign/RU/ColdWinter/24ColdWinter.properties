Description \nOver the burning roadways\n\nDate: 2nd of June, 1943 \nTime: 05:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nThank God for the clouds! Our entire IAP could have been court-martialed, myself included, if those clouds hadn't prevented those Germans from aiming accurately. As it was, most of the bombs fell on the outskirts of town, and little damage was done to the railway station. We got away with only a reprimand.\n\nThere were three more German air raids that day, but HQ took up eight entire regiments, and no more bombers reached Kursk.\n\nWe had a candid discussion with the CO, while the Commissar was on the phone apologizing to his superiors. We had to think of something. We were still at a disadvantage. We had no radar; observer reports hardly gave us enough warning against distant targets. The German tactic of sending an umbrella of fighters over our airfields before their bombers came through was effective and virtually guaranteed success. The only way to beat it was to eat away at their numbers, prevent them from being able to launch so many planes at will. And how could we do that with worn out planes and inexperienced pilots? Victory seemed more impossible every day.\n\nWe continued to be given new objectives. In addition to recon and escort, we were also given a whole frontline sector to defend, in addition to a large network of roads and railways. Once again, we were being spread too thin.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAdditional transport columns and armor are continually arriving to the sector in order to reinforce the layered defenses in the Kursk Salient. Our 283rd Division is responsible for the defense of one of the most important roadways in the sector: the road North of Rzhava leading to the front line. This road is seeing an increased amount of enemy air activity and, therefore, requires more constant protection. As scrambling on observer reports is proving insufficient, HQ demands a constant air umbrella over the roadway. Orders to the 519th demand that "not a single bomb must fall on our vehicles."\n\nYour Objective: patrol the strategic Rzhava road.\n\nYour Flight: 4 Yak-1B of the 519th IAP and 2 La-5F, 165th IAP, 286th IAD. \n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:00, heading North-West. Climbing to 1,000 m, proceed to Rzhava. You will be joined by La-5s of the 165th IAP. Your task is to patrol the roadway; the La-5s will protect you from prowling fighters. Patrol the roadway for 30 minutes. \n\n
