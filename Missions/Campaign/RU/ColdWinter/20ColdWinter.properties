Description \nOver the front line\n\nDate: 25th of May, 1943 \nTime: 08:15 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nAs the month of May drew to a close, we had to compile statistics of our squadron's performance. After two years of war, we still had much to learn.\n\nOne of the biggest successes this month was the air raid on the 6th of May. It was one of the first large-scale operations in our sector, and we caught the Germans by surprise. Over 200 aircraft, Pe-2s and Il-2s covered by plenty of fighters, struck German airfields throughout the region. The official score was a few dozen aircraft destroyed on the ground, 15 vehicles, 5 warehouses, and nine flak guns  one of the best single-day results in our history. Unfortunately the success came at a price. The mission cost us thirty Sturmoviks and ten fighters. Even though the mission was a surprise to the enemy, in hindsight, it was a mistake to do it in the afternoon (14:30). The Germans were at their stations, and were able to scramble to some planes, and put up a wall of flak. Fighters of the 1st Guards Division were late, and failed to block the outlying Luftwaffe airfields, and thus more German fighters harassed us on the way back. The squadrons' egress was sloppy; planes fell out of formation, making it ever easier for individual aircraft to be singled out for attack. And since over half of the fighter pilots on hand that day were rookies with little combat experience, our fighters did not do enough to defend the bombers.\n\nThe 519th continued to run into the same old problems. Early this month we lost two young pilots to accidents. Our planes were old, and the mechanics overworked. Old wrecks given to inexperienced pilots made in-flight emergencies twice as likely, and two 18-year-olds paid for engine failures with their lives.\n\nSergeant Govorov continued to improve as a pilot. He saved my life at least once. Four days ago, as I was making a pass at a "wader boot", a FW-190 got on my tail. A second before the German could fire, Govorov fired a burst from extremely close range and literally sawed the Fokker in half. The burning wreck impacted the Earth near our artillery positions. This was Alexei's second confirmed kill.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nDue to our growing control of the air, we are increasing the use of airborne artillery spotters. A Su-2 spotter will be working with our 105mm howitzers in the J10 quadrant. The 519th IAP is to escort the Su-2 throughout its mission.\n\nYour Objective: protect the Su-2 artillery spotter. \n\nYour Flight: 2 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 08:15, proceed to Stanovoe. Rendezvous with the Su-2 and escort it to J10. After it completes its mission, escort it back to Fatezh, then return home to Zolotuhino.\n\n
