Description \nBlinding Sun\n\nDate: 8th of June, 1943 \nTime: 16:50 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nThe entire regiment was lined up by the runway late last night. Staff Officer Semenov and Commissar Skakun spoke from the makeshift podium. They announced the start of a major German offensive. They were trying to avenge us for Stalingrad. A powerful advance is plowing through our defenses in the direction of Orel. The intensity of air battles is expected to significantly increase. We must utilize every ounce of our knowledge and bravery, and increase the cooperation with other squadrons in the region. The Party, the Soviet People demand our utmost dedication to the Ultimate Victory.\n\nSkakun reported that on the 24th of May, the Central Committee issued a new decree, entitled "On Structural Reorganization of Party and Comsomol Organization of the Red Army, and Strengthening The Role of Front-Line Newspapers". The decree called for creation of immediate, so-called "primary" party cells without each squadron, given the task of increasing the political awareness of the armed forces.\n\nSkakun came up to me after the meeting was over. Looking over my shoulder in his usual manner, he breathed heavily. I could tell he did not like me.\n\n"Listen up. You're the squadron commander. Whether you like it or not, you have to step up the pace. Your entire squadron is a disgrace politically. Out of ten pilots, only three are party members. The rest never even applied! Your Govorov is asking for a firing squad! He hasn't been to a Comsomol meeting in months. Studying fighter tactics is not an excuse."\n\n"Fighter tactics will save his life!" I exclaimed. "Being a party member won't. There are battles out there every day, heavy battles. We put our lives on the line all the time, and you, who sit in a dugout all day, are going to question our patriotism?"\n\nSkakun's eye became narrow slits.\n\n"Ah! Well, I may just stop withholding this report then. I hear Kostrov wasn't the only one shooting down friendly planes. I got a report from him that he saw more tracers than his own. Maybe he's right, eh, Lieutenant? Maybe you or your friend Govorov were the ones who actually shot that one down?"\n\n"Ask the CO. We couldn't have done that even if we wanted to. We took off 15 minutes after Kostrov, it's in the log. We couldn't have made it over there in time."\n\n"We'll see about that. Your CO could very well be covering for you. Certainly wouldn't be out of character for him... You just watch yourself Lieutenant. You know one of my responsibilities is to report my political suspicions back to the Party Bureau. They'd be very interested to know that you don't believe communist thinking is important to our victory. You understand me?"\n\n"Crystal clear, Major."\n\n"Great! Just great..."\n\nHe patted me on the shoulder, then smiled and extended his hand for a handshake. I turned around and walked away. I didn't get a second of sleep that night.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThe Luftwaffe is continuously striking our front-line units, attempting to disrupt our defenses and lower our morale. Central Front HQ demands constant air umbrella over our defending troops. \n\nYour Objective: Patrol the H10 and I10 quadrants. In case of an enemy strike, disrupt their attack and prevent targeted bombing of our units. \n\nYour Flight: 8 Yak-1B. \n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:50, heading North-West. Climb to 1500 m, proceed to Fatezh. Turn North and continue to climb to 2000 - 2500 m towards the front line at I10. Patrol quadrants I10 and H10 for 30 minutes. \n\nPairs 1 and 2 will provide immediate cover; pairs 3 and 4 will act as a strike group staying 500 m above 1 and 2. If bombers attack, immediate cover will attack the bombers, and the strike group will distract the fighters.\n\n
