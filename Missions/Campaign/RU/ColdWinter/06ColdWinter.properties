Description \nHiding in the clouds\n\nDate: 7th of January, 1942 \nTime: 08:30 \nWeather: Snow\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\nOur regiment was trying to make itself at home in Ostashevo. The accommodations were Spartan: no lights and no heat in the barracks, not even a desk for our staff officers at HQ. If a few of our pilots hadn't brought along food in their cockpits, we wouldn't have had anything to eat since our arrival. Artillery rumbled in the distance. We were just a few kilometers from the front.\n\nOur regiment... Regiment, what a misleading word. We were just a handful of hungry pilots in a gaggle of rickety planes. By this time, our air force had gone through considerable reorganization, switching from the pre-war large regiments with 62 planes to smaller, more flexible 20-plane regiments. And ours didn't have 20 planes, even on paper. The least experienced, or the unluckiest pilots got killed in accidents soon after arriving; others were shot out of the skies by the Germans on their first missions. The regiment was thinning out every day, with each sortie. By now we had 10 aircraft on paper, six of them airworthy. Our entire division could put no more than 40 planes in the air - that is, if we could get enough fuel, spare parts, and ammunition. And we were all that the new offensive had behind it. \n\nBy the 6th of January, my squadron had all of three aircraft: half of the regiment. Our CO, Nazarov, rarely flew any more; the old man's health was rapidly deteriorating. First squadron's leader, Captain Skvortzov, a veteran of the Spanish Civil war, was wounded on the 4th of January and was still in a hospital somewhere. He was replaced by Lt Sechkin, one of our most experienced pilots, who had only two kills since September of 1941.\n\nWe spent all day yesterday getting briefed by the division navigator, learning the landmarks, pouring over the maps. The small town of Shakhovskaya was to be our main target. The Germans were using it as a staging point.\n\nThe next few days would not be easy. We barely knew the area, and had no idea what the enemy would throw at us; and we'd be expected to perform large, complex tasks with insufficient numbers. The rumor was, fighter pilots would be asked to fly ground attack during their escort missions, to watch over the bombers as we dove alongside them.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\n20th Army demands updated information on enemy movements. Experienced pilots are ordered to fly continuous recon over the Shakhovskaya region.\n \nYour Objective: reconnoiter the Shakhovskaya region. Avoid air combat; do not attack ground targets, however attractive. Your main objective is to come back alive with the Intel.\n\nYour Flight: 1 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7mm BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 08:30, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. The waypoints are laid out to confuse enemy observers and to make it difficult to track your position. Fly at low altitude, no more than 500-600 m, hiding in the cloud cover as needed. Cross the front line in the L13 quadrant, heading South-West, disguising the true direction of your flight. Reconnoiter the following objectives: Karmanovo - Shakhovskaya highway; the bridge on that highway; the Pogoreloye Gorodische - Shakhovskaya highway; the Shakhovskaya - Lotoshino highway. \n\n
