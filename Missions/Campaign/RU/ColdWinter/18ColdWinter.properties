Description \nTraining Gloves\n\nDate: 10th of May, 1943 \nTime: 09:20 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nWe are expecting a German offensive any day. German reinforcements are continuing to arrive. New types of Panzer are everywhere. Tigers, Panthers. It looks like our T-34s finally have their match.\n\nThe German army group Center is moving its 9th Army under Generaloberst Model, closer to our positions. His forces are made up of three armored corps, and six Panzer, two motorized and seven infantry divisions. In the air, we are facing the 6th Luftflotte. All those forces are concentrated in a small area, so we are expecting a narrow strike, no more than 50 km wide. The Germans are up against our Central Front, which consists of five mixed armies, second armored and 16th Air armies, and 9th and 19th separate armored corps. Considering the severity of the situation, a second echelon was recently transferred to our sector, and the 2nd tank army and 9th and 19th armored corps are dug in behind our backs, as well as multiple artillery and flak regiments.\n\nAir battles rage on every day from dawn to dusk. Both sides are trying to prevent the other from moving up their units, from digging in, from amassing fuel and supplies near the frontline. Large formations of bombers pass each other over the front and bomb railway junctions, supply depots, and fixed defenses.\n\nOur 519th IAP is becoming weaker every day, taking continuous losses in air engagements with the Germans. Our losses still outnumber our victories, but our victories are increasing, and the Germans' are waning. We can almost see the day when we'll finally wrestle air control to our side.\n\nMore often than not, the young pilots stay on the ground. We are short of planes, and sometimes even the veterans have nothing to fly. The rookies are eager to join the fight, and when we received six new Yaks yesterday, they finally got their chance. The veterans quickly claimed the new planes, and six of the old ones would be available to the replacements. \n\nToday I decided to take my new friend Sgt. Govorov to a mock dogfight over our field. Govorov was circling around his new Yak, watching the mechanic pick apart its innards.\n\n"Getting ready, Govorov?" I asked him. "Take it easy, you're not being graded. We're going to concentrate on evasive maneuvers. I'll be attacking you from your six. Don't worry, I won't fire. I just want to see what you've got."\n\n"Yes, sir! I've been waiting for this a long time, trust me, I won't let you down. And don't worry; I won't fire on you either... Well, maybe just a few tracers over your head."\n\nWe both grinned at each other.\n \n"I'd like to see you try."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nGovorov took off at 16:10. He quickly gained altitude at tree-top height, and headed back to the airfield gaining altitude.\n\n"Daisy One, this is Daisy Five, holding at 500, ready for the engagement!" I heard his voice on the radio, checked my instruments one last time, then requested take-off clearance. "Daisy One, yeah, take-off already, we're all watching you. I grinned and advanced the throttle."\n\nA crackling voice suddenly came through my headphones.\n\n"This is Wasp One, this is Wasp One, I am under attack. Can anyone hear me? I repeat, we're under attack by enemy fighters!"\n\nDamn, where'd that come from on my frequency? I looked around and saw tracers flash through the air low over the horizon. We were too far away.\n\n"Wasp One, this is Daisy Five, I read you. I'll be there in a few, hold on. Turn towards me, heading, eeh..."\n\nDamn you, Govorov! Where are you going alone? He was already banking over the field. I thought of ordering him to turn back, but my mind was already made up.\n\nYour Objective: protect Govorov; defend the Wasp flight. \n\nYour Flight: 1 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nAct according to the situation. Mind your fuel: the Yak didn't fill up for the training flight.\n\n
