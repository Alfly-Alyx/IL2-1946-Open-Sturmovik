Description \nPreemptive Action\n\nDate: 6th of June, 1943 \nTime: 07:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe Intel I gathered immediately went up the line. The reaction was soon to follow. Within the hour we were ordered to strike, and our staff planners began to prepare the operations as the crews were already readying their planes. We got our orders in our cockpits. Six Il-2s were being sent up, and the most experienced veterans of the 519th would watch over them. \n\nYour Objective: escort the Il-2s.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00, heading North-West. Climb to 1,000 m, proceed to Fatezh, where you'll rendezvous with six Il-2s of the 2nd Guards ShAP. Cross the front line over H10, then head to G13. Lead the Sturmoviks to the targets you found earlier, then escort them back to Fatezh. \n\n
