Description \nReinforcements\n\nDate: 21st of January, 1942 \nTime: 10:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\n"Yes General, Sir, we got 'em. Yes Sir, both of the bastards... Yes, Sir, based on my plan, my idea... Yes, General, Sir. Thank you, Sir, just doing my duty!"\n\nChernov hung up the phone, all sweaty and red in the face. He yanked off his cap, wiped the sweat off with his forearm, and plunged to the nearest chair. He took a deep breath and then smiled at us.\n\n"Well, lads, that was fine, very fine! The General thanked you personally, and I think there may be some medals in your future. Go get some rest now, get some rest, take the rest of the day off."\n\nThe next day Hmelnov and I got letters of commendation from the front commander. Chernov got the Order of the Red Banner. He was so happy, he gave us an entire week off. \n\nAs we were celebrating, the Kalinin Front continued its advance towards Sychevka. A fight of incredible intensity raged on the outskirts, but the city remained in enemy hands. Germans still controlled the important Vyazma - Sychevka - Rzhev railway, allowing them to rapidly re-deploy their units from one hotspot to another. Sychevka received considerable reinforcements in the SS Division, Das Reich, two Panzer divisions, and a few other units. Our 39th Army could no longer advance.\n\nOn the Western Front, Germans began a gradual retreat on the 16th of January, and fell back to the defensive line along the Yuknov - Rzhev highway. The highway was also of extreme strategic importance, and the German High Command would not give it up easily.\n\nOur 20th Army liberated Lotoshino on the 16th, and Shakhovskaya the next day. These battles cost us many casualties, and after the liberation of Mozhaisk three days later, the 20th was barely capable of battle. On the same day, Stalin issued an order to commit the 1st Shock Army from the reserves and send it against the Germans alongside the 20th. The 1st was making good progress bringing up the flank, but the 20th was barely able to hold its current position.\n\nThe aviation attached to the 20th Army was taking on tasks of increased importance, and our resources were spread dangerously thin. We could only afford to strike the targets of the highest importance. \n\nOn the early morning of the 21st of January, Major Nazarov called me on the phone from the nearby airfield. He would be arriving later that day with five new planes and pilots. My days in command were over. I was back to just being a flight leader.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe Luftwaffe enjoys complete air superiority over our area. Colonel Chernov orders us to take all our remaining MiGs to the air and meet the arriving reinforcements, ensuring a safe passage.\n\nYour Objective: meet and escort the replacements back to Ostashevo.\n\nYour Flight: 3 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7mm BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:30, heading East. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 1,000 m and head East to the Istra River where you'll meet the five MiGs and escort them back to your field. \n\nNote: in the Aircraft Customization menu, please select the MiG-3ud_519_IAP.bmp paintscheme.\n\n
