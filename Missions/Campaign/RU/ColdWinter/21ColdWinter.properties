Description \nSturmoviks over Kromy\n\nDate: 27th of May, 1943 \nTime: 07:00 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\n"Great job, Govorov! Congratulations on your third kill. Keep this up, just two more left and you're an ace!"\n\nGovorov's face was glowing, his hands clutching the flying helmet. One day, this kid will be in the papers, I thought, certainly before I'll even make it there. Govorov looked like the type you'd see on a front-page photo: weathered face, big smile, blond hair fluttering in the wind. \n\n"Thank you, sir! Just don't transfer me anywhere, please, let me keep flying with you!"\n\n"I'm not planning to do that, Govorov, don't worry. Sometimes it's not my choice. Say the CO wants to fly with me whenever he goes out; but in other cases you're certainly my man."\n\nIn the evening, we received a bus full of actors and musicians, straight out of Moscow. We set up a makeshift stage right by the airstrip, and they gave us a hell of a show. A pianist played Chopin, and then a pretty girl began singing front-line songs, such as Katyusha and the Blue Handkerchief. \n\nAs she began A Friend Flying to Distant Lands, one of the new replacements gave us a whole different kind of show. Returning from high-speed recon, he decided to buzz the field; and as he realized the concert was already in process, he fired a short burst over air heads - accidentally, he claimed. Everyone hit the ground, the entertainment got scared out of their wits, and one ballet dancer got her tutu all dirty. It was a miracle our Commissar didn't shoot the joker when he landed. Major Skakun was clutching his holster as he showered the kid with verbal abuse. The young Sergeant was reprimanded and transferred out of the squadron that very night. Skakun didn't realize until the morning that he never even got the kid's recon report.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nKromy remains one of the most important targets in our sector. Long-range bombers hit Germans there during the night, and several follow-up strikes are scheduled for early this morning. Germans continue to concentrate infantry and armored vehicles in the vicinity, so there should be plenty of targets, and plenty of opposition.\n\nThe 519th will cover Il-2s of the 2nd Guards Division, as their regular escort, the 283rd IAP, is under strength and unavailable.\n\nYour Objective: cover Il-2s during their strike on Kromy.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00, heading North-West. Due to poor weather conditions proceed to rendezvous point at low altitude, below the cloud cover. Il-2s will be waiting for you over Fatezh. Follow the hunchbacks through their maneuvers to target. They will be changing directions in order to confuse enemy observers. After the strike on Kromy, escort the Il-2s back to Fatezh, then head home. \n\nStay out of the clouds throughout the flight. Maintain visual contact with the Il-2s. \n\n
