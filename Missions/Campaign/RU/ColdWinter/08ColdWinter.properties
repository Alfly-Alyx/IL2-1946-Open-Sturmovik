Description \nEarly Morning\n\nDate: 8th of January, 1942 \nTime: 06:45 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\nAs I shut off the engine, I barely had the strength to undo the latch on my safety harness. The cold air as I opened the canopy woke me up a bit. My flight suit was soaked, and I knew I had to change it fast before I got pneumonia. I crawled over the side and staggered off to the barracks. I felt weak and light-headed, my hands shook, and I was still seeing burning tracers over my head. There was still a loud humming in my ears from all the maneuvers, and I didnt even hear Sgt. Cherednechenko talking to me until he tapped me on my shoulder.\n\n"Comrade Lieutenant, excuse me, sir! How are you? I had engine trouble, I'm sorry, just couldn't keep up with you, it was overheating like a mother, I just couldn't stay there with you. I'm sorry, Sir, I wish I could have stayed to help!"\n\nI just waved at him and continued on to the CP. As I was finishing my report, the bomber crews walked in, looking just as sorry as I did. Winter flight suits, fur boots, sweaty hair clinging to their foreheads, unshaven, lips clenched into thin lines. A few of them patted me on my back, and I walked out.\n\nThe subsequent flights were even worse off. The CO spread us too thin, and by the time the second group was over the target, the Germans were waiting for them. Eight 109s bounced the six Peshkas, and they only had three I-16s to cover them. Just one of each came home. After that the third strike was called off, and Vanushkin had a very hard phone call to make to HQ. We wondered if there'd be a court martial coming.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nAs I was trying to come to my senses over a bowl of hot soup, they summoned me to CP. Colonel Chernov was in foul spirits, drinking his tea. The Division political commissar was sitting next to him, sharpening his pencils.\n\n"Listen here, Lieutenant. Got something for you." The colonel began. "Got a problem, actually. We've got these long-range bombers, they fly without escort, obviously, and they get harassed out there all the time. There's this pair of German aces that fly wherever they please, and they give us a lot of grief. Take a couple of MiGs and get your ass over to Lotoshino ASAP. We've lost three Il-4s there in the last two days, all to that same crew. I gotta report to HQ, and I'd like to at least have some good news for them."\n\nYour Objective: intercept German aces over Lotoshino.\n\nYour Flight: 2 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7mm BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:45, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climbing to 500 m, head North-West, proceed to Lotoshino. Climb to 5,000 - 5,500 m. Watch the airspace. Destroy German fighters if you find them.\n\n
