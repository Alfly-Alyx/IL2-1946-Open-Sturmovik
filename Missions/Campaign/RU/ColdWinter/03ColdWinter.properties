Description \nSelf-Reliance\n\nDate: 4th of January, 1942 \nTime: 08:00 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Balabanovo\n\nIt began to snow before dawn on the 3rd, the cloud cover almost touched the ground, and all flights were cancelled. The flight crews milled about while the ground crews spent the entire day at their stations. The repair situation was dire. Our MiGs were old, we've gotten the newest ones in the fall, and more than half were grounded. The entire division had only 13 airworthy fighters; our squadron had 6 of them. Most of our pilots were "horseless", and there was no rotation. They'd only get to fly if somebody was wounded or killed, and their plane remained intact. But I had a feeling that if that tank commander wasn't so impressed, Kolesov would have given my plane to somebody else yesterday. I couldn't bear the thought of being forbidden to fly, and I swore to never make any mistakes again.\n\nThe armament specialists made good use of the bad weather. Most of our MiGs received new underwing gondolas with heavy machine-guns. We needed more bite, especially against enemy bombers. If only I had had those a few missions ago, my score could have been one or two higher. As it is, I couldn't even claim those Ju-88s as damaged. That was like throwing peas at a brick wall.\n\nThe 4th of January brought strong winds that scared away the clouds. The January sky was crisp and gray. I felt cold just looking at it. At first light, the engines began revving up along the airstrip, and half an hour later the first flight of Il-2s was taking to the air. Snowy billows spreading behind them, the Sturmoviks circled over the field and headed out.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nWe were scrambled soon after. The 33rd Army staff requested some help with the "window frame", the FW-189 recon plane that's been hovering over their positions all morning, spotting for artillery. Infantry in the trenches needed help fast. This time around, Kolesov actually asked me how many planes I'd need. I figured, against a slow, unprotected window frame, I could even manage by myself. But just to be safe, I said I'd take one wingman with me.\n\nYour Objective: locate and neutralize the FW-189.\n\nYour Flight: 2 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7mm BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 08:00, heading South-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3500 - 4000 m and proceed North-West. Search for the recon plane in quadrants O9 and P10.\n\n
