Description \nHunting the hunters\n\nDate: 15th of January, 1942 \nTime: 7:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\nEven despite its overwhelming numerical superiority, the 20th army's advance is proceeding slowly. Every pilot at our airfield knew why. Each of us flew over horrific examples of our failures at least once. Our infantry with no armor, artillery or air support would advance across snowy planes on German fortifications. Artillery and mortar shells would be exploding amongst those slow black dots, multi-colored tracers from small arms would be cutting into the thinning formations. Sometimes we wondered if our sorties were timed with these advances to give the infantry the thought we'd actually be supporting them. But we always had other, more important targets deeper into the German territory. The infantry was usually enough on its own. The macabre progress was slow but steady. A few thousand men bought us a kilometer or two every day.\n\nOn the Kalinin front, our advance was taking on a precarious nature. The 39th Army was the only one making significant progress, and it had moved so far beyond both its flanks that it almost literally resembled an arrow on the map, with a tip and a shaft. It was in extreme danger of a counter-attack and encirclement.\n\nOn the Western Front, more forces were thrown into the fire. General Rokossovski's 16th and General Govorov's 5th Armies entered the battle on the 14th of January, and immediately made significant advances into enemy-held territory.\n\nOn our front all was relatively quiet. HQ again began to worry about those free hunters that kept shooting down our long-range bombers. We'd lost four more Il-4s in the past few days. Colonel Chernov called me to his office and ordered me to "kill those rotten sons of bitches, damn it". I knew why he was so worried. He could easily be court-martialed for all those lost bombers.\n\nI called my two "aces", all of three kills shared between them, and we thought it over. It was obvious we wouldn't be able to catch them easily. Those weren't some two bit hacks, those guys were as careful as they were experienced. If they saw the three of us, they'd probably just ignore us and go elsewhere. We couldn't chase them down. Our MiGs could fly higher, but the new 109F was faster.\n\nEventually Hmelnov got an idea. We knew where those guys were flying. We knew where they were based. If we couldn't catch them at altitude, maybe we could catch them at their airfield, just as they were taking off or landing. That sounded great, except how could we pass over German territory and not be noticed?\n\nStepanez had a crazy thought. What if we painted some German crosses on our MiGs? We could warn other pilots at our field not to attack us, and then fly low and slow over the German trenches. They'd think we were Messerschmitts. MiGs do look kind of similar.\n\nIt was just crazy enough to work. I ran it by Chernov. He was unsure for a while. This was highly uNorthodox and very dangerous; but the fear of court-martial was stronger. He told me he'd allow it, but if anything went wrong he'd deny any knowledge and hold me personally responsible. I agreed. Now if I could only steal some black paint somewhere...\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nGerman free hunters have been patrolling our long-range bomber sectors lately. German punctuality would be their downfall. By our calculations, they should be landing back at their field around 07:10  07:15 every morning. \n\nYour Objective: flying MiG-3s with German markings, attack and destroy a pair of German aces over their airfield.\n\nYour Flight: 2 MiG-3UD (German markings).\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7 BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Cross the front line at 300 m altitude at the designated area. Our flak gunners there are aware of your flight; other sectors of the front may fire on you. \nProceed South-West at top speed; after crossing the second river, turn South, proceed to the next river. Turn 90 degrees East and proceed to the Uvarovka airfield. \n\nNote: in the Aircraft Customization menu, please select the MiG-3ud_519_IAP_BC.bmp paintscheme, and turn off the "Markings" option. \n\n
