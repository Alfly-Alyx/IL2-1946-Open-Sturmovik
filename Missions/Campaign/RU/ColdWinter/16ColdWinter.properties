Description \nBetween Trosna and Kromy\n\nDate: 3rd of May, 1943 \nTime: 10:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\n"Great job, Sergeant. That was excellent for your first dogfight. You can pull a little harder on the stick in the future, though, that way a Fokker can't follow you at all. But, for now, don't worry about kills. You're just gaining experience for now; the most important thing is to stay alive."\n\n"Yes, thank you, sir." Sergeant Govorov said breathily, his eyes still wild from the fight. "I just tried to stay with you. Man, the things you were doing... They never told us about maneuvers like that at flight school. Oh man, I'm soaked! Ah, but tell me, where did everybody go, why did they leave us alone?"\n\n"That's our SOP for patrols, Sergeant. Near the front line we split off into pairs. That way we cover a much larger area. If something happens we just call for reinforcements. Don't know why it didn't work that well this time, though, that's something I have to discuss with other flight leaders. You did very well, though. Go get some rest. Congratulations on surviving your first dogfight. The rest of the war will be easier... Well, I'm off to the CP."\n\nThe CP had moved recently; now it was a fair distance from the strip, in a well camouflaged dugout. Despite the weather, the interior was always cool and damp. Our CO, Major Deryagin, was the best we've had since the war began; loved by his men, hated by his superiors. He was honest and unpresumptuous, treated his subordinates like his friends, and was always willing to listen. Unfortunately, his counterpart, Political Commissar Major Skakun was a sleazy man with no opinions of his own, and the main goal of his life was to please his superiors. Promotions for him came quickly, and we couldn't wait for him to get the next star on his shoulder and move on out of our lives. I walked past Skakun and saluted Major Deryagin.\n\n"Ah, the hero of the hour!" Deryagin said. "Got your confirmation already, the artillery on the ground called me up. How are the freshies?"\n\n"Don't know about the others, but Sergeant Govorov did very well. Didn't panic, followed orders, stayed on my ass. I'm very happy with him. If I could give him a few lessons he'd become a real asset. The others, though, you'll have to ask their flight leaders."\n\n"How come?" The Commissar interrupted. "It's your responsibility before the Party to know the squadron the Soviet People entrusted you with. We're expecting a journalist from Pravda soon. He'll ask you, "How are the young communists slaughtering the Fascist animals?" What will you tell him? That you don't know?"\n\n"No sir. I'll tell him that they're not slaughtering anybody yet, that they're not ready yet, and that they're too green. You know, yourself; those fellows across the line aren't amateurs. They're professionals, those Molders aces. Our greenhorns for them..."\n\n"Lieutenant! This is very alarming. You grossly misunderstand the most basic Party principles. Are you a communist or what? Don't you remember what the Communist Party Theses of May 1st taught us?"\n\n"Sorry, Sir, didn't have the time to read them." I looked to Deryagin for support. The CO was looking at the wall. "I've been flying a lot these past few days."\n\n"That's even more alarming that a squadron leader worries so little about the political education of his pilots! But fine, I'll remind you, just this once. The Central Committee calls to you, you personally Lieutenant, to continue advancing towards our final victory, to constantly prepare for the battles with the German enslavers, to avenge our villages, towns and cities, raped women, murdered children, the enslaved old men, and to continue killing Hitler's spawn to the last drop of your blood! And here you are, rambling about 'Molder's aces'. Your rhetoric reeks of defeatism, Lieutenant! There are no aces on the other side of the line, no 'fellows'. They're beasts, enslavers, evil monsters devoid of humanity!"\n\nWhat is it with me and Commissars? I just have no luck with them at all. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe stalemate at the front continues. We could all feel the big offensive looming over the horizon. Both sides were bringing significant reinforcement to the Kursk Salient.\n\nAt this point, Intel was of crucial importance. We needed to have constant up-to-date information on enemy strength and movements.\n\nYour Objective: reconnoiter the Kromy - Trosna highway.\n\nYour Flight: 2 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:00, heading North-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Proceed to Rzhava, then turn North-West toward the front line. Cross into German-held territory in quadrant H10. Then proceed to Trosna at 1,000 m of altitude, then follow the highway until Kromy. Note any movement seen along the route, down to every bicycle.\n\nYou are permitted to engage opportune targets along your route, as long as you do not alter your course or linger over the target. You are allowed one firing pass only at each target.\n\nAfter Kromy, turn West, and proceed to G13, then turn South to H8, and return to Zolotuhino.\n\n
