Description \nRuza Bridge\n\nDate: 13th of January, 1942 \nTime: 10:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\n519th IAP's CO, Major Nazarov is on a trip to Central Asia, out to acquire new aircraft and pilots for our squadron. Ops Officer Kolesov hoped to be named the temporary CO, but to my incredible surprise he was passed over. The 519ths temporary commander will be - me! Nazarov must have been really impressed by that dogfight over the front two weeks ago; then I suppose I was indeed the most experienced of the eight pilots we had left. Now I'd be reporting directly to Colonel Chernov; and Kolesov wouldn't be able to haunt me quite as openly.\n \nDeputy CO of the squadron... That would impress Katya the waitress, but the Germans wouldn't share that feeling. As of this morning, the 519th had exactly four airworthy MiG-3s. Out of my eight pilots, only two have any experience, Kolya Stepanez and Vasya Hmelnov. The rest of the pilots have no kills, virtually no experience, with combat sorties in the single digits. They're certainly eager to prove themselves, but to send those kids out to fight German aces... Maybe it was for the better I only had four planes. Some of the kids would live longer.\n\nThe last time we flew to strike Shakhovskaya, I took Sergey Zvetkov, one of the replacements, out with me. It would be his second sortie with the squadron, but he looked more worried than before his first. As it turned out, he'd never dropped a bomb in his life. They didn't even teach them the technique at the flight school; they must have figured a fighter pilot didn't need that kind of knowledge. I felt sick. To take a pilot like that out on a mission was a liability, nothing else. Getting killed would be bad enough, but this one could actually drop bombs on our own troops, do something else to jeopardize the entire mission. I didn't have the time to request another pilot instead of him that time, but now it would me my responsibility to make sure things like that never happened again.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nGermans are continuing to put up fierce resistance all along our line of advance. German reinforcements are continually arriving to the front line from the South, from Gzhatsk. Bridges South of our location have therefore been deemed of vital strategic importance. Your target for this morning is the bridge on the river Ruza, South of Shakhovskaya in the K14 quadrant. The bridge is well protected with 88s and smaller caliber flak; and the quadrant is also constantly patrolled by German fighters.\n\nAttempts to destroy the bridge by Sturmoviks and light bombers have so far not been successful. HQ is willing to try a hit-and-run attack by a small formation of high-speed fighters.\n\nA flight of I-16s will arrive over target just before your strike, in order to distract the enemy and clear the skies of enemy fighters.\n\nYour Target: Ruza bridge. \n\nYour Flight: 3 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:30, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Your top cover flight of I-16s is already en route to target. Follow some distance behind and below them. After they are engaged by fighters, proceed to target. Stay at 700 m or below. Watch the airspace.\n\n
