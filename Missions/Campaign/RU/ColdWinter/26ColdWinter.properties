Description \nRecon\n\nDate: 6th of June, 1943 \nTime: 04:45 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nWho would have thought Kostrov, the self-proclaimed master tactician, would be the one to down our own bomber? "I didn't hear anything!" he claimed after landing. "The radio was acting up." I didn't ask him why, in that case, he immediately knew he had to defend himself.\n\nThe downed bomber with red stars triggered a rapid chain of events. A group of investigators from division staff was at Zolotuhino the same afternoon. We expected an arrest and a court-martial, but they simply questioned Kostrov and released him for "insufficient evidence". The rest of the squadron, however, had to go through mandatory aircraft recognition re-training, and even take a test in low-light conditions. \n\nDuring the last two weeks, we've lost ten more planes, and six more pilots, six of them less than two weeks at the squadron. Few of the veterans cared.\n\nIn early June, we got a few more new planes. That was important. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nCentral Front HQ is receiving uncorroborated reports that several Tiger tank battalions have been sent to the Kursk Salient. They are mounting a large-scale aerial recon operation, aimed to simultaneously cover a large sector. Veterans of the 16th Air Army are assigned to the task. The 519th IAP will be searching the following quadrants: G12, G13, H12, and H13.\n\nYour Objective: reconnoiter G13. All targets must be noted; enemy heavy tanks are of the highest importance. \n\nYour Flight: 1 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 04:45, heading North-West. Proceed to Fatezh. Climb to 900-1,000 m, then stay in the clouds. Cross the front line over F10. Staying in the clouds, head towards G13. Approaching the designated sector, descend to 300  400 m. Enemy vehicles will most likely be camouflaged. \n\n
