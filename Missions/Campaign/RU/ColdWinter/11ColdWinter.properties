Description \nOver the Battlefield\n\nDate: 11th of January, 1942 \nTime: 16:45 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\nThe German fighters seemed to mock us. You could feel it in their razor-sharp tactics, in their maneuvers. They were confident and deadly. Their steady formations, excellent teamwork, and deadly aim were all signs of long combat experience, which we could only hate and envy. Every day our flight line was getting thinner. After every sortie a group of mechanics continued to linger by an empty spot, and finally stumble off home.\n\nUnlike the Germans we continued to fly in Vs of three, unwieldy formations that held us back in maneuvers and prevented us from effectively engaging German pairs. Our teamwork also left much to be desired. Even now, many of the planes had no radios at all, or stations set to receive only and not to transmit. And even if we had the ability, the tactics and the experience in controlling planes in the air just wasn't there. Flight leaders had to shout their simple orders into the throat mikes without knowing if they'd be heard. Many of the older pilots still continued to rely on hand gestures and rocking their wings.\n\nWe were outnumbered, outgunned, and outperformed. It was still hard to believe that the overall war would be lost; but the knowledge that I myself would be shot down and killed was cemented in my mind. I prepared for death every time I strapped myself in; and every time I got to un-strap the safety harness, I marveled at the fact.\n\nThe Kalinin offensive was in its fourth day and the Western offensive in its second. The Kalinin front was making good progress towards Rzhev and Sychevka. Other parts of the front didn't fare quite as well. General Vostrukov's 22nd Army failed to penetrate German defenses on the Kalinin offensive's right flank. On the left flank, the 31st Army under General Yushkevich was doing equally poorly. German 161st and 162nd divisions outnumbered three to one, successfully repealed Yushkevich's entire army made up of six divisions.\n\nAlong our offensive on the Western Front, the 20th Army barely managed to overcome the German line in a single sector, and advanced only a few kilometers deep. Heavy fighting continued all along the frontline. Air support was needed every day, every hour, every minute. Morale in our infantry units was falling. German planes circled over them constantly, while Soviet planes were nowhere to be found.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe enemy is reportedly moving additional units towards Shakhovskaya in order to stop our advance. Long columns of vehicles are jamming the roadways on the approaches to the town.\n\nThe 20th Army demands more air strikes on these reinforcements. It is the top priority for the 47th SAD. Everything we have is taking to the air, including even the most obsolete planes like the I-5 and the R-10.\n\nYour Objective: enemy vehicles between Shakhovskaya and the front line.\n\nYour Flight: 3 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:45, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Cross the front line South of our main advance, head to Shakhovskaya, and proceed along the highway at tree-top height. Bomb and strafe enemy vehicles. Immediately after the attack, head North-West, then return home. \n\n
