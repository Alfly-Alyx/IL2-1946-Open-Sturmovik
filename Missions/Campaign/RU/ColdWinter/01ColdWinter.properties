Description \nOver the Front Line\n\nDate: 2nd of January, 1942 \nTime: 07:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Balabanovo\n\nThe war's first winter seemed to drag on forever. We were defending Moscow from the vultures with swastikas on the wings, and they kept on coming. We just couldn't keep them away. Could we ever win this war? It seemed impossible, insane to even imagine ever pushing the invaders back, and one day flying over their capital like they had flown over ours.\n\nI was a young lieutenant, just now promoted to flight leader. I wasn't good enough for the task, but everyone else was dead. It seemed inevitable that I would join them soon enough. Flight leaders didn't last long in our rag-tag division. The 519th was part of the 47th Mixed Air Division - mixed because it had everything in it, fighters, attack, dive-bombers, light bombers, heavy bombers... Our CO, Colonel Chernov, somehow managed to make sense of this whole thing. \n\nThe 2nd of January began as usual: rise before dawn, powdered eggs, half-track to the airfield. The Western Front continued their counter-attack, and we were supporting them from the air.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nMy flight is ordered to patrol a small village in the O9 quadrant. The front-line village, just barely on our side of the line, was being used as a staging point for a tank brigade. I assumed they'd be used to advance towards Mozhaisk.\n\n"You are personally responsible, Lieutenant, not a single bomb must fall on those tanks!" our operations officer barked, his hand tapping his holster. "Dismissed."\n\nTake-off was at o-seven-hundred. By now we knew most of the German bases in the area, the landmarks, and had a pretty good idea where the bombers might be coming from. We needed to catch them before they could begin they run. Hopefully, our measly three planes would scare them off.\n\nYour Objective: defend our tanks.\n\nYour Flight: 3 MiG-3UD.\n \nYour Loadout: 6 RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00, heading South-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climbing to 500 m, proceed to Borovsk. Continuing to climb to 1500-1700 m, proceed to the front line. Patrol over the designated village on the German side of the lines, attempting to intercept the bombers before they reach our tanks. You will be joined by I-16s of the 627th IAP. \n\nHint: in the Aircraft Customization menu, you can select the historical MiG-3ud_519_IAP.bmp paintscheme.\n\n
