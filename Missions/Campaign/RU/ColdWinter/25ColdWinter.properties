Description \nScramble, scramble!\n\nDate: 5th of June, 1943 \nTime: 03:30 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nAnother 2 am duty for me. I quickly got used to it after discovering I could sleep in the cockpit. If an order came through, 60 seconds was more than enough time to open my eyes and advance the throttle. The CO must have liked me. I always got late-night shifts, which were rarely scrambled. We weren't night fighters after all.\n\nMy plane was parked on the runway. This time there were four of us, two pairs, the other one led by Captain Kostrov, and he was first in line for a scramble. Soft breeze entered my open canopy. I didn't even realize I had fallen asleep. Kostrov was scrambled at 03:15 to intercept a single high-speed target. A few seconds later I was back asleep. The fur liner of my helmet was so comfy... \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nScramble, scramble! A formation of enemy bombers is en route to Maloarchangelsk. The second alert pair is ordered to intercept. \n\nYour Objective: locate and destroy enemy bombers.\n\nYour Flight: 2 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 03:30, heading North-West.
