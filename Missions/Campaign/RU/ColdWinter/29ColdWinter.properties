Description \nAt dusk\n\nDate: 15th of June, 1943 \nTime: 19:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Zolotuhino\n\nA young pilot, who was just beginning to gain the respect of veterans and rack up confirmed kills, lost his life yesterday. This is how Konstantin Verbin died:\n\nLate last night the HQ demanded more air strikes. No bombers were available, so we had to send fighters. Verbin was flying number two position in a flight of four Yaks. Their leader was Captain Kostrov, on his first combat mission after the friendly fire incident. Their target, Trosna, was well defended, and our poorly protected fighters got more than they bargained for. Every plane was hit.\n\nVerbin's plane was showered with the fragments of two near-misses, and his engine took several hits and began to lose power. Trailing thin smoke, he made several more passes at the enemy, and then headed home. Kostrov led his flight back home at full speed, and did not slow down when Verbin began to fall behind. A few minutes later, he was no longer in sight. Kostrov and two others landed back at base; Verbin's plane was missing. \n\nTwo days later, we received a report from an infantry commander, whose soldiers observed a dogfight between Verbin and a pair of Messers. Verbin bagged one, but couldn't beat the other. His score now stood at five planes. He died an ace.\n\nFormally, Kostrov had done nothing wrong. It wasn't the responsibility of a flight leader to watch over his wingman. However, few pilots could forgive him. We stopped shaking his hand or talking to him outside of official duties. Kostrov complained to his friend Skakun, but even our Commissar could see there was little he could do. The situation was too complicated. He advised Kostrov to request a transfer.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nTwo days later Govorov came up to me after breakfast.\n\n"You know, boss, that Messer that got Verbin, I think he still comes around that sector."\n\n"Why do you think so?"\n\n"I looked into it. Our division lost a whole bunch of stragglers in that same sector the past few weeks, and we continue to lose them now, still to a pair of 109s. I figure that fellow got himself a new wingman, and is back to his old tricks."\n\n"You can't be sure it's the same guy!"\n\n"But why not? Nobody else is using those tactics. There aren't that many 109s left in this area, and they usually do high-altitude patrols on their own side of the line. In our entire area, we only get something like this happening in one place, and always to a pair of 109s."\n\n"You know what? You may be right. Let me run this by the CO."\n\nChernov was immediately taken up by the idea. A pair of roaming free hunters in our rear was not a good thing, and he needed to deal with it before the news went up the line. Before somebody like Skakun found the connection to our losses, Chernov decided to send up a decoy flight.\n\nThere'd be three of us. I picked Govorov and Zaichenkov to go with me, both excellent pilots and my personal friends. Govorov already had seven kills, and Zaichenkov had 14. They wouldn't let me down.\n\nI would act as a decoy, a sitting duck. My life depended on them.\n\nYour Flight: 3 Yak-1B. \n\nYour Loadout: one of the planes is carrying two FAB-100s.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 19:00, heading North-West. Climb to 900 m in the direction of Fatezh. Turn North and proceed to Trosna. Zaichenkov and Govorov pass Trosna at high speed and turn West. You are to bomb a target of opportunity there, minimizing your time over target as much as possible, and then follow the lead pair. Imitate being shot up. Over our lines, began to drift back. Aim to lose visual contact with the lead pair over G9. Once over that quadrant, began to circle, imitating loss of orientation. Stay at 1,000 - 1,500 m. In the meantime Zaichenkov and Govorov will circle back and climb to a position above and to the East of you.\n\nIf attacked, call Zaichenkov on the radio, and immediately initiate a high-speed dive to the East. Do not engage the free hunters. Lead them under the Zaichenkov-Govorov pair. \n\n
