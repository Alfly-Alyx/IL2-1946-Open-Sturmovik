Description \nMozhaisk\n\nDate: 2nd of January, 1942 \nTime: 14:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Balabanovo\n\nAll the way back to base I was in a foul mood, and it was growing worse by the minute. I marched off to the CP, already imagining Major Kolesov's rage. It's been weeks since I've seen our Operations Officer smile; besides, by now he was without a doubt under the influence. \n\nThere was also, of course, the matter of Katya the waitress. Today Kolesov finally had his excuse. \n\n"Hello, Lieutenant," he scowled, "whats the story? I hear you disobeyed a direct order?"\n\n"But Sir! We did everything we could!"\n\n"Oh? You know I could have you court-martialed within the hour? Or was I misinformed, and our tanks weren't bombed?"\n\n"Sir! But we only..."\n\n"Didn't you receive a direct order, to prevent any - ANY - bombs from falling on those tanks? Didn't you receive and acknowledge that order?"\n\n"Yes Sir, I did. But if you want to court-martial me, they'd also be interested to know why you only launched three planes, and kept the rest on the ground."\n\n"Ah, so it's my fault? Why didn't you bring this up before you flew out? Why didn't you ask me for more planes then?"\n\nThe phone rang. Kolesov was still fuming when he picked up and bellowed "Yes?" into the receiver, and then he turned white as a sheet, stood at attention and apologized. It was none other than our Division CO, Colonel Chernov. The commander of the tank brigade had called to complain about insufficient fighter screen, but at the same time praised the performance of the three of us. He asked for more of the same, just in greater numbers.\n\nKolesov hung up the phone and took a deep breath. He gave me a heavy, unblinking stare and wiped the sweat off his face.\n\n"You're off the hook for now, Lieutenant. I guess you're a real hero as it turns out. Fine, get out of here, and thank your wingmen for their performance up there. Dismissed!"\n\nGreat way to ring in the New Year. I still felt like crap, but my skin was getting thicker with every incident like this. By the second sortie of the day I forgot all about it.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThe Germans are continuing to hold back our offensive. They are dug in and well fortified along the Mozhaisk - Dorohovo highway. All available assets are being sent to attack enemy ground defenses.\n\nYour Objective: search and destroy enemy vehicles along the Mozhaisk highway.\n\nYour Flight: 3 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 6 RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 14:00, heading South-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climbing to 500 m, proceed to Borovsk, then turn North-West. Cross the front line at 800 - 1,000 m in the vicinity of Verei. Do not get into it too much; keep at least a quarter of your ammo for the return trip, in case you encounter enemy fighters.\n\n
