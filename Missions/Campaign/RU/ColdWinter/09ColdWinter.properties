Description \nAchtung, jaeger!\n\nDate: 10th of January, 1942 \nTime: 06:45 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\nWe had to postpone the intercept after the air raid, and it was moved to the next morning. I was taking Sgt. Zaitzev this time. As usual, something went wrong, and when we got to our planes my mechanic was crumpling his fur hat into a ball, looking very upset. The division gave all of the fuel to the Sturmoviks that were taking off that morning, and we barely got any for our MiGs. He had to pump fuel out of our other fighters, and still couldn't give us anywhere near a full tank.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe offensive was continuing on the Kalinin front, now in its third day. The plan was to send Maslennikov's 39th Army through the enemy's hasty defenses and retake Rzhev. After that the main strength of the Kalinin front would strike for Sychevka and Vyazma, destroying German communications, and then, in conjunction with the Western Front, to completely surround and destroy the entire Rzhev-Vyazma region.\n\nOn the 8th, the 39th Army did manage to advance 15 km into the German-held territory; however the armies on both its flanks failed to make the same progress and were barely moving ahead, leaving the 39th dangerously exposed.\n\nOur Western Front had to continue pressing the advance it had started over two months ago, in December of 1941, and move forward toward Vyazma, aiming to destroy the entire German Army Group Center.\n\nOur front's right flank, where Ostashevo was situated, was preparing a pincer movement into the surrounding German units. The attack would come from the positions between the Lama and Ruza rivers, spearheaded by General Vlasov's 20th Army. Our 47th SAD, a part of the 20th Army, would be supporting the pincer from the air.\n\nDue to logistical differences, the attack was postponed by one day, to the afternoon of 10th of January.\n\nYour Objective: intercept German aces over Lotoshino.\n\nYour Flight: 2 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7mm BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:45, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climbing to 500 m head North-West, proceed to Lotoshino. Climb to 5,000 - 5,500 m. Watch the airspace. Destroy German fighters if you find them. Watch your fuel!\n\n
