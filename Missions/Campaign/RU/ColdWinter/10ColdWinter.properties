Description \nThe offensive begins!\n\nDate: 11th of January, 1942 \nTime: 07:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\nColonel Chernov was not pleased that we missed those 109s. He had little to report upstairs. Fortunately, he didn't have the time to scold us; the staff phone was ringing off the hook. The Shakhovskaya offensive had begun, and our division was constantly receiving updated orders. At  dawn, things began to look gloomier, as the low clouds gathered over the area and it soon began to snow. It didn't look like we'd be able to lend the offensive any support. \n\nStill, the 20th Army was adamant. The morale of the troops wasn't high, and advancing in these conditions would be difficult. The HQ demanded planes over the infantry, and was threatening a court-martial. Chernov requested a written order to be forwarded to him, and then called two dive-bomber pilots to his office. The orders were simple: take-off, buzz the advancing infantry a few times, and get right back home. \n\nA pair of Pe-2s slowly sped down the runway and disappeared into the white. We never saw them again.\n\nThe weather began to improve after midnight, and by dawn the planning was already completed for the early morning support sorties. The Shakhovskaya advance was proceeding along a very narrow corridor, less than 20 km wide, and the breakthrough itself was only 8 km wide. This tiny area saw a significant concentration of troops: two infantry divisions, two infantry brigades, and two independent tank battalions. Two groups of Guards under Generals Remizov and Katukov attacked with a guard brigade, one infantry and two tank brigades, a tank battalion, and a cavalry division.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nEarly in the morning a flight of Il-2s will attack German artillery batteries along their second line of defense. German guns threaten both our infantry and our tanks, and thus are of crucial importance to the battle. Two flights from two squadrons will be escorting the Sturmoviks. Your three MiG-3s will fly immediate cover, while a strike group of Yak-1s will fly above you and protect both your MiGs and the Sturmoviks from the attack.\n\nYour Objective: protect the IL-2s.\n\nYour Flight: 3 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7mm BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:30, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Stay close to the Il-2s at all times. Don't get involved in dogfights.\n\n
