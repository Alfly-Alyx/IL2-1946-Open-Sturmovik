Description \nWe need help!\n\nDate: 4th of January, 1942 \nTime: 14:00 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Balabanovo\n\nWhat was I thinking? And I wondered why Kolesov smiled like that when I asked for two planes. I should have taken all four, and then two of us could have covered the other two while they attacked the window frame. Four planes would have been completely justified  and taking two was folly, suicide, dereliction of duty! Thankfully, we managed to complete our objective; otherwise Kolesov would finally have his reason to get rid of me.\n\nWhen Kostrov, my wingman, and I got to the CP, Kolesov wasn't even there. Instead we were met by the CO himself, Major Nazarov. He had just gotten off the phone with the 33rd army, with the staff officer who personally witnessed our battle with the 109s.\n\n"Ah, hello there, hello!" Nazarov smiled and shook our hands. "Wonderful job lads, wonderful! We need more pilots like you, to go out there and shoot down Goering's vultures in full view of our troops! That'd raise their morale! Oh, I should put you up for an award, Lieutenant!"\n\nWe left the CP grinning from ear to ear. I ate my entire chocolate bar in one gulp, and we went to our barracks discussing the air battle, making hand planes. It was a beautiful day, no wind, no snow, just plenty of sunshine and deep blue skies. For a few hours I forgot all about the war.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nRight after lunch I was summoned back to CP. The CO was all wound up. A squadron of hunchbacks went out on a mission a while ago. They had an escort of three I-16s from the 627th, and their lead, Ishak, developed engine trouble and had to turn back. Now the Il-2s had only two Greenhorns above them, and if the Germans bounced, they were all toast. \n\n"Lieutenant, scramble your MiGs and get your ass over there as fast as you can! We can't afford to lose any hunchbacks. They're the most precious thing we have. Besides, heads will roll at the 627th if the Il-2s they were defending are lost. Come on, come on, go!"\n\nYour Objective: escort the Il-2s back to the airfield.\n\nYour Flight: 3 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7 BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 14:00, heading South-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 700 m and fly along the Balabanovo - Dorohovo highway. Fly as fast as possible, those Sturmoviks need help! \n\n
