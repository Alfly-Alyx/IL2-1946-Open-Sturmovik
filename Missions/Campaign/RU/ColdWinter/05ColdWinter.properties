Description \nRebasing\n\nDate: 5th of January, 1942 \nTime: 16:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Balabanovo\n\nIn the past few days, our neighbors, the 627th, IAP fared worst of all. They failed to prevent the losses of their Il-2s yesterday, and had already lost 14 of their 15 I-16s, since being activated only five days prior. The 627th was practically annihilated. \n\nThey had obsolete aircraft, obsolete tactics. Most of the fighters they were flying were old worn-out planes of the Moscow flying club, and their engines were equally ancient, in dire need of overhauls. Some of those engines had been used to train student mechanics for years. And these barely airworthy machines, obsolete for years, have been given to fresh graduates of the Kachin air school, rushed through the training as the war started. Out of the 14 planes lost, only five were lost in combat. The other nine were lost to various accidents, usually taking their 18-year-old Junior Lieutenants with them.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nOur 47th Mixed Air Division has been transferred under direct control of Colonel Vanushkins 20th VVS Army. His first orders were to move us to the Ostashevo airfield, where a planned offensive towards Gzhatsk was in dire need of air support. We'd be moving in small groups, most of the fighters following pathfinder planes flown by more experienced navigators.\n\nSeveral of the 519th planes are already en route to the new airfield.\n\nYour Objective: Take off with your three MiG-3UDs and follow the pathfinder Pe-3 to Ostashevo.\n\nYour Flight: 3 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7mm BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:00, heading South-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Follow the Pe-3 at an altitude of 2,000 m.\n\n
