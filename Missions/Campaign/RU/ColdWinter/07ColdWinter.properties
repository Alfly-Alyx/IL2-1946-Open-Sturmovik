Description \nEscorting Pe-2s\n\nDate: 7th of January, 1942 \nTime: 11:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\nAs I was flying recon, Sechkin got killed. An Hs-126, a German artillery spotter, came over our field. Usually these "crutches" as we called them, hung over the front lines and it was unusual to see them so far into our territory. The pilot was flying slowly and erratically, making weird turns. Maybe the German was wounded or lost? Sechkin was just getting ready for his recon, so he gunned the engine and went for the crutch. Maybe he'd be able to force him to land at our field, and take the pilot and the plane prisoner.\n\nAs soon as he got off the ground, the Henschel went into the low clouds, and a pair of Messerschmitts popped out. Sechkin didn't even get to raise his landing gear. A short burst, and he crashed and burned just off the runway threshold.\n\nA few seconds later the Messerschmitts disappeared into the clouds behind the Henschel.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThis mornings recon data was received by the 20th Army HQ, and General Vlasov immediately ordered the entire 47th SAD to strike Shakhovskaya. Division CO, Vanushkin, is committing all our Pe-2 bombers to the task, and our IAP will be flying cover. Instead of a single large-scale raid, we're mounting several smaller ones, to avoid detection.\n\nYour Objective: escort the Pe-2s the entire way to target and then back again.\n\nYour Flight: 2 MiG-3UD.\n\nYour Loadout: 2x12.7mm BK machine-guns.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 11:30, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Stay above the bombers, watch the airspace around them. The bombers will be most vulnerable during their bombing runs. \n\n
