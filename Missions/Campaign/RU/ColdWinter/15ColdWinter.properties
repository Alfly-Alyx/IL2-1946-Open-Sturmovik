Description \nA year later\n\nDate: 2nd of May, 1943 \nTime: 05:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Zolotuhino \n\nA year has passed. On that day last winter, the German air raid caught us off guard. Usually we got at least some advance warning of incoming enemy bombers. Infantry in the trenches would spot them, patrolling aircraft would radio back to base or, at the very worst, our own ground crews and observers would spot the black dots on the horizon. But those "wader boots" seemed to materialize right over our heads. It's not surprising that the results were so devastating. We lost pilots, planes, ground crew, two flak gunners. Twelve men lost their lives in the course of a few minutes.\n\nTwo of the new MiGs collided while trying to land simultaneously. One of the pilots was still alive when he was pulled out of the burning wreckage. Below his waste, the flight suit burned completely off, and a few buttons and a metal bracket remained embedded in his flesh. His face was calm, and he looked at us inquisitively for a couple of minutes before his eyes stopped moving. \n\nThat affected me more than anything else in this entire war. When I was told that Major Nazarov had also been killed, I barely paid attention. I had thought I was ready to die in battle; for the last ten missions or so I felt no more fear. But now, after seeing that poor bastard, my heart sank just thinking of airplanes. I knew I had to fly as soon as possible, before the fear began to set in. I needed to take the replacements out too. They were affected even worse than me. I scheduled a familiarization flight right away. We took off over the smoldering wreckage of that MiG, with the ambulance still parked next to it. By the time we landed, the runway was cleared. The memory was beginning to fade.\n\nWe had to make a lot of changes after the air raid. Our Political Commissar, Smirnov, was one of the 12 men killed. The next day we got a new one, Captain Skakun, a recent political school graduate. \n\nMajor Kolesov was wounded and, in the hospital, he immediately requested a transfer to a different regiment. A few days later it was granted. Few lamented our Operations Officer's departure.\n\nA week after the air raid, we received five more MiGs and pilots from the reserves. We continued to support the 20th Army's offensive without much success. The offensive broke down at the Yuknov - Rzhev defensive line and was soon called off.\n\nBy the summer of 1941 we were transferred to the 1st Air Army and we defended our retreating troops during the new German Summer Offensive. By the end of October, we barely had any strength left, and the squadron was deactivated and moved to Siberia where we'd be reinforced to full strength and trained on a new plane type, the Yakovlev Yak-1. The pilots liked the new fighter immediately. Light and responsive, the "little hawk" inspired confidence. We finally felt that we could meet the Germans on equal terms. We trained for four months, and then spent a few more weeks deployed to the strategic reserve, wondering where we'd be sent next.\n\nOn April 1st, 1943, the orders came through. The 519th was attached to the 283rd Fighter Division, 16th Air army, Central Front. \n\nThe Central Front had been in existence since February, made up of the units of the former Don Front. Fighting in the Orel region, the Central Front went on defensive in late March, forming the Northern flank of the Kursk Salient. The Front was commanded by the famous General Konstantin Rokossovski.\n\nWe returned to Zolotuhino, the same airfield we'd occupied since the summer of 1942. The 519th had the following strategic objectives: to defend the Central Front units and the Kursk railway junction; and to escort Sturmoviks wherever they had to go. By this time the make-up of fighter squadrons was once again modified, and we had three squadrons instead of two. Our pilots were better trained, our aircraft on a par with the enemy's. The German air superiority was waning. Still, we suffered heavy casualties. In the first three weeks we lost 12 planes and 10 pilots. By now, reinforcements arrived almost immediately, and we were rarely under strength. Unfortunately, the rookies rarely lasted long. They faced aces of the famous Molders squadron, and didn't stand much of a chance. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nNew replacements have arrived fresh out of flight school. CO orders a familiarization flight for all the replacements. Each will fly the wing of an experienced veteran. \n\nYour Objective: fly to the front line, get familiar with the theater of operations.\n\nYour Flight: 2 Yak-1B.\n\nYour Loadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:00, heading North-west. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 500 m, turn to Ponyri and ascend to 2,500 m. After Ponyri head North-West and proceed to Tagino. Do not cross the front line. Turn to Glazunovka, then Maloarchangelsk. Return home.\nDo not waste fuel in flight; do not make complicated maneuvers, make sure the wingmen can stay with you at all times. Do not cross the front line. In case of an enemy attack, withdraw deeper into our territory. \n\nNote: in the Aircraft Customization menu, please select the Yak-1b_519_IAP.bmp paintscheme, and turn off the "Markings" option.\n\n
