Description \nFrankfurt an der Oder\n\nDate: 19th of April, 1945 \nTime: 09:00 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Debno\n\nCommissar Sivtzev got some new propaganda posters from army HQ, and spent the entire evening plastering all ten of them around the mess hall and the briefing room.\n\nIn the early morning, as I was coming back from my briefing, I found most of my squadron gathered in the corner, talking, and bursting into laughter. They saw me, and one after another the boys turned around and stood at attention, but most of them couldn't keep the smiles off their faces. The more they tried, the more they failed, and when Lieutenant Matrenichev finally chortled with laughter, most of the others just couldn't hold it in.\n\n"Well, heroes, Stalin's falcons, what's so funny? Do I amuse you?"\n\nApparently I didn't. The boys were laughing at the poster. Apparently some pencil-pusher up above messed up, and sent us posters intended for fighter pilots. "Pilot! Don't chase that jet!" and "Sure Aim in Dogfight is Key to Victory" were all over our walls. \n\nMatrenichev offered to gather all the pilots and lead them on the search of those pesky Me-262s.\n\n"Great idea" I said. "Why don't you go tell Sivtzev, and maybe mention that somebody at HQ made a mistake. I'm sure he'll be rolling on the floor laughing."\n\nThe squadron lost their smiles right away. Even mentioning Hitler's name wouldn't have gotten such a result.\n\n"All right, squadron." I said, "Saddle up. We've got work to do."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAdvance units have advanced deep into the enemy defenses. However well behind our advance, a fierce battle is continuing in the town of Frankfurt an der Oder. So far our troops have been unable to take the town. We are ordered to strike targets within Frankfurt, and due to difficult weather conditions we are only launching single planes.\n\nYour Target: troop concentration in downtown Frankfurt / Oder.\n\nYour Flight: 1 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-500 + 2 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 09:00, heading North-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 1,000 m, and drop bombs from level flight. Your targets will be concentrated around the Northern part of the town, near the Oder River bridge. Multiple small-caliber flak positions are reported in the area. \n\n
