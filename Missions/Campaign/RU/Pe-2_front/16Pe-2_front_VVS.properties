Description \nSeelow Heights\n\nDate: 16th of April, 1945 \nTime: 16:45 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Debno\n\nThis early morning the 1st Byelorussian Front finally launched an attack on Berlin. So many of my comrades didn't make it to see this day, so many good people... Shot, bombed, burned, tortured, their mangled bodies lay near Rzhev, Kursk, Orsha, Vitebsk. The war dragged through my land in one direction and then the other, leaving a horrific trail of cadavers. My comrades are lost among untold millions of lives crushed by the past four years. \n\nWe knew there would be more. One last batch. Our enemy had nothing to lose. The entire Berlin area was a gigantic fortified stronghold, with three solid lines of defense, one after another. We expected no easy victory in the air, with thousands of guns below us, and advanced new jet fighters hiding in the sun and behind the clouds.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nThis morning, as the offensive started, our regiment bombed enemy strongholds with all 27 of our planes. By the afternoon our troops were approaching Seelow Heights, which the enemy fiercely defended. Heavy fighting continues throughout the region. We are ordered to bomb German artillery at Seelow Heights. Due to worsening Weather we are flying in smaller groups. \n\nYour Target: enemy artillery at Seelow Heights.\n\nYour Flight: 3 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 6 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:45, heading north-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Due to cloud cover, stay at 1,000 m or lower. Conduct the bombing run from the North-West. Your targets will be concentrated around the Northern section of Seelow Heights. Drop bombs from level flight.\n\n
