Description \nIn the Clouds\n\nDate: 11th of July, 1943 \nTime: 06:00\nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Ognevka\n\nThe Weather front we'd been told about finally hit us by the afternoon of the 10th. The previous days were filled with stagnant heat, and now Mother Nature went all out to undo the effects. Rolling thunder muted the artillery; walls of rain rinsed the dust off our planes. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe sun peeked through the clouds a few times right before it disappeared into the horizon. The cloud cover remained thick. I was ordered to the CP at around 6.\n\n"Have a seat," Major Morozov pointed me to the shell crate, "I've got something for you."\n\nI readied my map and my chewed-up pencil.\n\n"I'm getting killed over here by the division CO, and the division CO is getting murdered by the army HQ. And over there, I hear, they're all getting it big time from Zhukov himself. They keep trying to hit this thing way behind the German lines, but just can't do it. There's this bridge on the Orel - Kromy highway, the one over the Oka River. It's the only bridge in that area for many miles."\n\nMorozov took a sip of tea from his prized crystal glass in an ornamental glass holder, and let the steam wash over his face for a few seconds. \n\n"Gotta get that bridge." He said. "Cut that supply line for even a day, that might turn this whole battle around. But to send another squadron, or even another flight there seems almost useless now. A big fat flight just can't get through all the flak around that bridge... You see what I'm trying to say?"\n\n"Oh, crystal clear, Comrade Major." I moved up to the map. "Can't wait to hear more."\n\nThe Major began poking the map with his dirty yellow fingernail, drawing lines and circles, poking this spot or the next. I barely heard him.\n\n"You know," I finally said, "maybe something else might work."\n\n"Hmm?" the major gave me a heavy stare. "Fine, let's hear it."\n\n"Look outside. These clouds are so thick you could move the whole VVS through them, no one will see it. I figure, if it's still like this at dawn, I could get my flight up into it, head straight for the bridge between the layers, then poke through the clouds right above the bridge, drop the eggs, get back into the clouds and swagger on back home."\n\nThe Major took a few more sips of his tea.\n\n"Fine." He said. "If you want to play around the clouds, fine. Fine. But I can't let you take your flight. You're going alone. Dismissed."\n\nI spent the rest of the evening planning the flight with my navigator. Kaidarin marked a few landmarks along the route, wrote down all the headings and distances. Hopefully we'd only need to come out of the clouds for a few seconds at a time to get our bearings. \n\nWe went to sleep in the wet grass right beneath our Peshka.\n\nYour Target: Oka bridge on the Orel  Kromy highway. \n\nYour Flight: 1 Pe-2 / 110.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:00, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Proceed in formation at 1,000 meters towards Somovo. Climb to 1,300 or above over Somovo, stay in the cloud cover, stay on the marked course. Check your bearings over the river bend in the O13 quadrant. Turn West on heading 275, locate the bridge and destroy it. Head back into clouds, don't ease off the throttles all the way home. \n\n
