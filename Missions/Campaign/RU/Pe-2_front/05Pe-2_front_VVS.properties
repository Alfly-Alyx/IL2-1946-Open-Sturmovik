Description \nAt Dusk\n\nDate: 9th of July, 1943 \nTime: 18:45\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ognevka\n\nThe Germans kept widening the breach in our lines all through the 7th and the 8th. We could smell the smoke even at our base. By 10:00 on July the 7th the Fascists broke through the 307th Infantry Division and finally entered Ponyri from the North-West. Street fighting followed. A hasty counter-attack slowed the Germans down, but they soon recovered and forced the second line of defense to crumble and retreat towards the Southern outskirts.\n\nBy the 8th, the 307th CO General, Ershov, managed to string together another counter-attack, and his infantry somehow managed to push the Germans back out of town. We were exhausted, but the Germans looked like they could barely hold on as well. The 307th hoped this would be it. \n\nOn the same day, our regiment got a welcome present: ten new Pe-2 / 110s. A transport brought some replacement crews, as well: new pilots, navigators, gunners, fresh out of flight school. By the end of the day, all of them were assigned to their squadrons. All of them would fly out early the next morning.\n \nMission Briefing: \n\nAerial recon suggests that the enemy is sending fresh infantry, tanks and APCs towards the fight. The main supply artery for this is the Trosna - Rzhava highway. We are ordered to attack enemy columns along the highway.\n \nYour Objective: Search and destroy enemy vehicles.\n \nYour Flight: 3 Pe-2 / 84.\n \nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-500.\n \nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:45, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Proceed in formation at 1,000 meters towards Verhnesmorodino. Search and destroy enemy vehicles North-West of the village.\n\n
