Description \nBombing the Airfield\n\nDate: 25th of April, 1945 \nTime: 15:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Debno\n\n"Hey, Palochkin, see how Berlin looks now?"\n\nI sat next to him in the grass, and got out my cigarette case.\n\n"Yeah. Nothing special, just a giant field of rubble. If I didn't know it was Berlin, I'd never guess." Palochkin yawned. "Oh man, I'm so sleepy, you wouldn't believe it. A miracle I haven't fallen asleep on a mission yet."\n\n"You're telling me... This'll be over very soon, though."\n\n"Oh, I wish. We'll see what happens."\n\n"I keep wondering about after the war. What are we going to do? I love bombing. God, how will I ever live without it? Oh, seeing those little piggies explode below, boom-boom-boom, that string of flashes, all that smoke, I love it... Must be completely out of my mind."\n\n"That's because you've got nothing else to look at. All you ever see is planes and bombs and gauges. Get back to civilian life, man. Oh man, girls, restaurants, music. You won't even remember this damn war after you're back in the world."\n\n"Ha! I hope you're right."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nWe are ordered to bomb one of the airfields in the vicinity of Berlin.
