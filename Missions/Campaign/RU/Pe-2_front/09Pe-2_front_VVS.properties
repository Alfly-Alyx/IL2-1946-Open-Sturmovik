Description \nSmell of the Offensive\n\nDate: 13th of July, 1943 \nTime: 05:20 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Somovo\n\nThe defensive part of battle is over. The enemy never made the break-through they were hoping for, and now they had lost steam and were sitting there catching their breath, ready for the picking. On the 12th of July, the Western and Bryansk fronts sprang the Kursk Salient trap.\n\nGeneral Sokolovsky commands the Western Front. His Front is mounting a Southward pincer on enemy defenses. The plan is to link up with the Bryansk Front, surrounding and destroying the Germans around Bolkhov. The Western Front's strike will be spearheaded by General Bagramyan's 11th Guards Army.\n\nGeneral Popov's Bryansk Front is meanwhile plowing Westward and in the direction of Orel. During this movement they've also been given the task of taking over the Orel-Kursk railway and liberating the town.\n\nThe attack on the 11th was a surprise to the enemy. The initial phase, intended only to probe and map out German defenses, broke through and took hold within the German's own trenches. However the counter-attack soon came and the Germans were back to their positions. On the 12th of July, we carried out our main strike. We softened them up with artillery and close support aircraft for a few hours, and then the human wave poured forth. \n\nWe heard all this on the radio. Our part of the front was relatively quiet. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nCentral Front is planning an offensive in a northerly direction, towards Kromy.
