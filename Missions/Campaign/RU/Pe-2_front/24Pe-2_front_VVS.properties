Description \nOver the Reichstag\n\nDate: 28th of April, 1945 \nTime: 17:30 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Debno\n\nI knew it as I taxied back past the empty spot. I stopped my plane, turned everything off, thanked my crew and climbed out of the cockpit. I looked at Evgenich, he nodded heavily, and I walked past him and went to my cot. \n\nWe'd lost six more planes that day, and Palochkin's was one of them. No one saw it go down. The chances weren't very high, but I still had hope. And I hated myself for it. That hope was the worst feeling in the world. Could he still be out there somewhere, crawling in the dark?\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe fighting has now reached downtown Berlin. We are approaching the Reichs Chancellery. The Germans have turned the Tiergarten Park into a formidable stronghold. If we take it, most of the Berlin government buildings will be in our direct line of fire. Our tanks tried to take Tiergarten this afternoon, but heavy fire forced them back. We need to make sure that won't be the case tomorrow.\n\nYour Target: heavy tanks along Tiergarten, in the Reichstag district.\n\nYour Flight: 3 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:30, heading North-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 600 m, stay under the cloud cover. Your targets are marked on your maps.\n\n
