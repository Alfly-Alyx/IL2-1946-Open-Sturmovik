Description \nNew Base\n\nDate: 11th of July, 1943 \nTime: 19:30 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Ognevka\n\nA couple of hours after we landed, a recon flight confirmed it. We got the bridge. A traffic jam all the way to Kromy had already formed, and it would only get worse. A couple of Sturmovik squadrons with full fighter cover were on the way. They say, in an Il-2 you can see everything: tracers reaching for that truck, the explosion lifting it up, little running men thrust off the ground, losing chunks, disappearing into the smoke...\n\n"Congratulations! Yeah! I knew you wouldn't let me down!" Morozov was trying to sprain my wrist.\n\nI wanted to say "I didn't do it for you, Morozov," but just faked a smile instead.\n\n"You little devil!" He was beaming. "What you think, officers? Recommend this one for the Star?"\n\n"Comrade Major," I said, I didn't earn an award, my navigator did. Without Kaidarin I'd never have made it."\n\n"Ah, Kaidarin, yes! I'll recommend him too! Come on, somebody get me two blank commendations! Kuklya!"\n\nI had a feeling Morozov was also expecting somebody to fill them out for him.\n\nThe phone rang.\n\n"Comrade Major, for you... Commander of the Army!"\n\n"Yes, Morozov on the telephone! That's right, sir, we got that bridge for you! Yes, sir... Yes, under my command, Senior Lieutenant... Oh... Yes, sir, no longer a Senior Lt... Oh, thank you. Yes, sir.... Good bye sir!"\n\nMorozov hung up, beaming, and sat on his stool. \n\n"General Rudenko, right there on the phone with me, thanked us for this success! You, my friend, have just been promoted to Captain,  so quit looking at me like that. Go on, go get us some 'fuel' from the warehouse, tell them it's for me. We'll celebrate! Come on, come on!\n\nNew orders came through before we had a chance to celebrate.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nWe're ordered to re-base to the Somovo airfield, closer to the new front line.
