Description \nThe Darkness\n\nDate: 5th of July, 1943\nTime: 10:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ognevka\n\nTwo days ago, on July third, our regiment was ordered to the Ognevka airfield in the Kursk Salient. We've barely had any time to gather our things, but since we barely had any things to begin with, it wasn't so bad. We flew over at dusk, one plane at a time, at tree-top height. The last couple of planes had to land in complete darkness. This way the enemy was less likely to notice our move. \n\nWe hurriedly camouflaged our crates and gathered by the new HQ. The pilots smoked quietly. We wanted to know where we would spend the night. Major Kuklya came out of the dugout and said, coughing, that we'd have to sleep by our planes. We could get orders early in the morning. Besides, the BAO officer who was sent here earlier never got around to arranging accommodations for us at the nearby village; that would be remedied by tomorrow.\n\nWell, what could we do? After two years at war, most of us were used to things like that. At least it was July, not December. The crews wandered off and slapped together whatever they could - winter coats, rucksacks, parachutes. Some slept by their planes, and some slept in their cockpits. We couldn't start any fires, of course, and with all the mosquitoes, hardly anyone got a good night's sleep. At dawn the mechanics were already warming up the engines. Scruffy, grumpy, sleepy. This was our regiment. Business as usual.\n\nThe breakfast was late, so we had our morning drill on an empty stomach. It isn't easy to stand at attention and listen to the CO while your stomach is devouring you from inside. Thankfully Kuklya was brief, as usual. \n\n"Comrades!" He said, "We have a big task, an important task. We're expecting a big German offensive literally any minute. Once it hits, we have to stop it. We'll be bombing their advancing regiments, and their supply lines, and their supply depots, all along the front, and deep into it. All personnel are to remain by their planes throughout the day. Thank you."\n\nWe spent the entire day sitting out the July heat in the shade of our airplanes. The order never came through. The offensive hadn't hit just yet.\n\nI took a couple of naps, smoked almost my entire supply of cigarettes, and cracked jokes with my crew. The nicest crew I could ever hope for. Navigator Kaidarin was at the front for over a year, knew his business well, never got me lost. He wasn't a bad shot either, so when things got sour, I didn't have to worry about our rear quarter. Radioman Baichukov, despite his tender age, was a responsible fellow and knew more about radios than I knew about planes.\n\nBy late evening, when we knew we weren't flying out, everyone began gathering together and showing off, taunting the Germans, urging on the big offensive. But as I went to sleep I knew everyone else also secretly hoped that today would also be quiet, that no orders would come.\n\nDistant shelling woke us up in the morning. It was getting closer. The crews barely spoke to each other as they washed, shaved and ate their breakfast. After the meal, everyone staggered off and sat by their planes, their heads turned towards the approaching artillery. \n\nThey were taking their sweet time up at the HQ. Some of the pilots began pacing around their aircraft, smoking, rubbing their hands. The orders were just not coming in.\n\nFinally by 09:30 we were ordered to the HQ. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nIn the early morning of July the Fifth the enemy began a large-scale offensive in the Kursk Salient region. The enemy committed significant numbers of artillery and aircraft. Other details were unknown at the time. \n\nDivision HQ is ordering urgent strikes on the enemy troops engaging our forces. \n\nYour Target: enemy troops at Tagino.\n\nYour Flight: 9 x Pe-2 / 84.\n\nYour Loadout: 6 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:00, heading west. Flight route is marked on your maps. Proceed in formation at 1,000 meters towards Somovo, where you''ll rendezvous with your escort, a flight of Yak-1Bs from the 283rd IAP. Proceed at 2,000 m through Gubkino and Maloarchangelsk towards Nikolskoe. You should cross the front line somewhere around Glazunovka. Conduct level bombing near Tagino from 2,000 m.\n\n
