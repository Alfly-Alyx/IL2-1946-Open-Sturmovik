Description \nArtillery to the North\n\nDate: 26th of April, 1945 \nTime: 13:30 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Debno\n\nNasty morning. Bad weather, and a Yak from the fighter regiment at our field crashed in full view of everyone. For whatever reason, the pilot failed to correct for torque, veered off to the side, and in confusion or shock pressed the trigger, spraying tracers over parked planes. The mechanics readying the aircraft right by the landing strip began scattering off, but the Yak plowed right into them and exploded.\n\nPalochkin was one of the singles bombing Berlin that morning. I got delayed at the CP, and as I ran to the flight line to drag him to lunch, my heart sank. His spot was empty.\n\n"Wasn't he due back at twelve?" I asked his mechanic.\n\n"Yes sir, twenty minutes ago." \n\n"Ah, well, doesn't mean anything. Only twenty minutes, that's pretty normal. Nothing to worry about."\n\nI kept looking at the horizon as I walked to my plane. Halfway there I remembered lunch, but thought I'd rather wait for Palochkin.\n\n"Where are we off to today, sir?" my mechanic asked.\n\n"Bah! Where else? Berlin as usual!"\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe 1st Byelorussian is engaged in heavy fighting in the streets of Berlin. One of the parks on the route of our advance is heavily fortified and has a large concentration of artillery and heavy tanks. \n\nYour Target: enemy defenses in Berlin.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 13:30, heading north-West.
