Description \nLong Awaited Day\n\nDate: 24th of April, 1945 \nTime: 06:30 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Debno\n\nSivtzev had the error corrected the next day. The fighter posters disappeared, and new propaganda for bomber pilots hung in their places.\n\nThe pilots however continued joking about "chasing those jets", and some of the whispers must have reached Sivtzev. He never let anyone know however, and never even acknowledged the incident.\n\nOn the 22nd, the second squadron's navigator, Demidenko, got in trouble. In the evening, as everyone went to bed, he set fire to a large house on the main square of a nearby village. The house burnt to the ground, but fortunately the fire didn't spread, and no one was hurt. The village was deserted; all the Germans had run off before the Red Army got there. Demidenko was dead drunk, and mumbled something about returning the favor. Apparently the Germans had burnt his entire village two years before, looking for partisans.\n\nThey let Demidenko sober up, had a conversation with him, and let him off the hook. No one wanted to punish him further. The HQ just issued a new order, specifically forbidding any damage to property or the populace. The order caused more ruckus than the arson. Few could accept the rapid switch, after four years, from "when you see a German, kill it." \n\nOn the 24th, the squadron finally got the mission it had been waiting for for so long.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nSivtzev made a speech this morning. Today our squadron will have the solemn honor of striking at the heart of Hitler's vile snake pit. The righteous anger of the Soviet people will rise as a string of iron death discharged out of our bomb bays.\n\nThen, our CO, Major Morozov, made a speech. The fight would be nasty, he said. We've got this wounded, bleeding beast cornered. It's got nowhere to go but lunge back at us. Hitler's got plenty of flak in his lair, and Goering's vultures are circling over their capital in their new-fangled jets. \n\nThen we were ordered to support the advance of our troops into the city, and strike the scattered German defenses in the outskirts.\n\nYour Target: German positions on the North-Eastern outskirts of Berlin.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:30, heading North-west. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 2,000 m, drop bombs from level flight. Your targets are vehicles and artillery on the outskirts of the enemy capital. \n\nYour escort will be 4 La-7s of the 1st Guards IAK.\n\n
