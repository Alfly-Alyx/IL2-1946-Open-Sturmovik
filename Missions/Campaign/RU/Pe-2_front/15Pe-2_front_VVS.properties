Description \nBombing Seelow\n\nDate: 14th of April, 1945 \nTime: 07:00 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Debno\n\nAlmost two years have passed. We've seen action over Orel, Bryansk, Sevsk, Gomel and Bobruisk, liberated White Russia, bombed the Germans out of my hometown, and kept moving West. By 1945 I was flying over the enemy's homeland. Our 779th BAP took part in the Vistula - Oder campaign, and in March we helped the 61st Army wipe out the last remains of Hitler's troops on Oders Western bank. \n\nAnd now, in April of 1945, we had almost reached Germany's heart, Berlin.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nPreparations are fully underway for an offensive we've been waiting and hoping for these past four years. Berlin, the lair of the beast, is just an hour away from our field. I can't wait to see it with my own eyes, destroy it with my own bombs. \n\nEveryone's morale is exceedingly high. We can all sense the final victory, now surely only weeks away. \n\nThe 16th Air Army, of which we are a part, is finishing up the last set of tasks connected to the 1st Byelorussian Front's offensive. Throughout April we've conducted photo recon missions over the projected routes of advance, mapped out German defenses and infrastructure. \n\nAnd now we're beginning to show our teeth. As final steps of our preparation, we will begin to attack front-line targets in small flights.\n\nYour Target: the concentration of vehicles at Seelow. \n\nYour Flight: 3 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 6 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00, heading North-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Due to cloud cover, stay at 1,000 m or lower. Conduct the bombing run from the North-West. Your targets will be concentrated around the Northern part of Seelow. Drop bombs from level flight.\n\nSeelow is well defended, so be mindful of flak and small-caliber fire at all times. \n\nDue to the Weather, we are unable to provide fighter escort.\n\n
