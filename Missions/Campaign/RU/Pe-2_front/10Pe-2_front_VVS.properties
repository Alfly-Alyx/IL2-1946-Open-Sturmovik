Description \nNaryshkino\n\nDate: 14th of July, 1943 \nTime: 05:35 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Somovo\n\nThe next day I got up early, as usual. The day before, my #1 engine seemed to be on its last leg barely had any power, and the entire squadron had to slow down to stay in formation with me. I couldn't keep flying like that.\n\nThe mechanic promised to work on it all night, and I ran up to check up on him as soon as I had gotten my cold water shave. \n\n"How are things, Evgenich, figure out my engine yet?" I said.\n\n"No problem, Captain. Looks like  the fuel hose got nipped by a fragment, got that patched up easy enough." He answered. "But that ain't all. Come up here, on the wing, if you don't mind, got something to show ya."\n\nGrunting, Evgenich lurched up over the wing. I followed.\n\n"Lookit." Evgenich pointed at two jagged holes in the side of the canopy. "Pow! Wait till you see your chute. Got both slugs outta your cabin, went clean through your chute, and fell to the floor. A couple of inches to the side, Captain, we wouldn't be here talking..."\n\nI blinked, then put a finger through one of the holes. 12.77mm. Hmm.\n\n"Captain, Sir, youre wanted at the CP," a runner interrupted. "Right now, sir!"\n\nMajor Morozov was standing at attention by the telephone, listening to another General, no doubt. He waved at me and pointed at an ammo crate, then returned to peering at a new shiny piece of metal on his tunic. Red Banner.\n\n"Yes, Sir! Yes, SIR! Thank you, Sir!" Morozov hung up and looked at me. "Got a thing here, Lieu... I mean, Captain. We're a squadron of what? That's right, dive-bombers. So why aren't we doing any dive-bombing? People are wondering. Am I right or what?"\n\n"Yes, of course Major, that's exactly right. We should be dive-bombing."\n\n"So, Captain, why do you think that is? I'll tell you why. The big offensive. They're thinking big up there, organizing non-stop bombardments by a thousand and a half bombers. No time to think about us. Our Peshkas are just one of the cars in this train, the Soviet Express. We're just going along and bombing for psychological effect. Of course, the accuracy suffers, but maybe that's how it's gotta be. Erm."\n\nMorozov picked something out of his teeth, examined it, and continued.\n\n"And 'sides, who here's actually got any experience dive-bombing? You, couple more guys? Every member of our crew's gotta get some dive-bombing experience, and they won't get that by sittin' around. So, the idea is to start working on that. How's that sound?"\n\n"That sounds very good, Major, Sir. It would be great to give our replacements some dive-bombing experience, but frankly even our veterans, myself included, gotta be pretty rusty at this point. Maybe we should gather up the veterans first, send them out there on a refresher mission or two?"\n\n"Oh, great idea Captain, great idea! Why don't you arrange all this then, huh? Gather up, say, five more old-timers, and, let's see here... Over here, Naryshkino, by Orel. See what you can do about that train station there."\n\n"Yes, sir... Ah, could we take the newer planes, the 110s? And also have the mechanics give them a once-over, to check if the dive brakes are actually working?"\n\n"Sure, sure, yeah... Anything else? Dismissed."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe Naryshkino railway junction is an important link between the enemy rear echelon and the front lines and the station is well-protected against threats from the air. However a small precision strike should be able to take it out of commission for at least a day or two, making the supply situation even worse for the Germans.\n\nYour Objective: Dive-bomb the Naryshkino railway station. \n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 110.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-250\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:35, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Locate targets in Naryshkino around the railway junction, concentrating on trains and warehouses. Conduct dive-bombing, beginning the dive from 3,000 meters. Suggested recovery altitude: 1,500 m. \n\nYou will be escorted by four La-5s of the 92nd IAP. \n\n
