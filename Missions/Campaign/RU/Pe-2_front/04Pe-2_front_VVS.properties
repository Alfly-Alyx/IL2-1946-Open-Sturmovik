Description \nOver Tagino\n\nDate: 8th of July, 1943 \nTime: 05:15\nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Ognevka\n\nThe Squad commanders were the first ones up, as usual. Gloomy and tired, they headed towards the CP to get their orders. We had lost 11 planes in three days, most of them with their crews. Few of us looked forward to more fighting.\n\nMajor Morozov barely looked up as we walked in. He was staring at the map, drawing the last bit of smoke out of his cigarette butt. He had probably just gotten off the phone with his higher-ups. \n\n"Morning, Eagles". He said. "We keep fighting like this, in two days we'll have no regiment. I understand, sure, the battle is tough, gotta have losses. But this! We gotta do something. Can't keep this up, just can't..."\n\n"Are you blaming us?" Captain Leshkin jumped in. "What can we do about those Fokkers if we don't have any fighter cover? We can't shoot them down, can't out-run them. We need fighter cover! And not just on paper, we need real fighters watching over us, not just roaming around elsewhere, wasting fuel."\n\n"You're so smart, Leshkin". Major said. "You don't think I know that? You want my job? You want to sit here in this dump, get on the phone with the fighters? You think you'll do better? I'm doing all I can. Can't ask me for more. Ah, enough of this crap, enough. Here's what you got."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nHQ orders us back towards Tagino, where significant enemy forces are concentrating. Fresh infantry are arriving there before proceeding towards the front. There are also repair bases, supply depots, hospitals, and a few regimental headquarters at Tagino, making it one of the most important dots on the map. \n\nYour Target: Tagino.\n \nYour Flight: 5 Pe-2 / 84.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-100 + 2 FAB-250\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:15, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Proceed in formation at 1,000 meters towards Somovo. Fighter escort will be provided along the route. \nAt Somovo climb to 1,300, head towards Gubkino. At Gubkino turn towards the airfield NE of Maloarchangelsk. The airfield is your IP. Conduct bombing W of IP from 1,300 meters, or whatever altitude the cloud cover permits. Conduct level bombing on targets concentrated around downtown Tagino.\n\n
