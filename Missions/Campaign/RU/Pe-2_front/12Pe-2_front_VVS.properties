Description \nOver Orel\n\nDate: 19th of July, 1943 \nTime: 05:30 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Somovo\n\nThe 13th Army, which began the offensive on the 15th, had taken significant casualties in the defensive part of the battle. As a result, their advance has been relatively slow. However the fresh 48th and 70th armies and the 2nd tank army have joined the 13th, and helped move the offensive along. \n\nThe Western Front has fared better. By the evening of the 18th the advance regiments of the 11th Guards under Bagramyan were 70 km into the German-held territory. They began surrounding the Germans near Bolkhov. The 61st Army, which had been moving from the North and the East, has advanced within 10 km of the city, and now Hitler's forces are almost completely surrounded. \n\nOur regiment continued to fly an endless string of missions. Major Morozov began to fly, as well, yearning to join the celebrated group of the "Flying Commanders". However, even he himself admitted he had less first-hand experience than our squadron leaders, so he commanded no more than six planes in the air. "Getting too old here", he would say, "can't handle as much as I could."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nYesterday morning we received orders to bomb the city of Orel. Morozov decided to lead the squadron himself. The assignment was too important.\n\nYour Objective: Conduct level bombing on targets inside the city of Orel.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 110 and 3 Pe-2 / 84.\n\nYour Loadout: 6 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:30, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Major Morozovs flight is already in the air. Form up and follow his flight. Conduct level bombing from 2,500 m. Your targets will be fuel and ammunition dumps by the Oka River. You will be escorted by four La-5s of the 92nd IAP. \n\n
