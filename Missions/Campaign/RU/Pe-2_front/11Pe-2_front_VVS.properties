Description \nOur Offensive Begins\n\nDate: 15th of July, 1943 \nTime: 18:20\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Somovo\n\n"So, Palochkin, how are you making out?"\n\nThe young pilot was sitting in the shade, reading a letter. He looked up at me, jumped up, smiled and saluted.\n\n"Every thing's great, sir! Got a letter from home here. Reading it now..."\n\n"Everyone all right there I hope?"\n\n"Yes, sir, thank you. Everyone's alive... Well, except for my brother that is, my big brother. He was KIA last Fall, you see Sir, at Stalingrad."\n\n"Infantry?"\n\n"Tank gunner, sir. I've been flying for him, paying them back, Sir."\n\n"Ah. That's good."\n\n"And how about you, Sir? Your family all right?"\n\n"No."\n\nPalochkin grew quiet and looked away. I began to walk past, but then stopped and continued.\n\n"I'm from up East, near Minsk, you see? My whole family got killed in an air raid, just as the war started. The bomb shelter took a direct hit. My wife, my daughter... If not for fighting in this war, I don't know how I'd live with myself. But I have a purpose now, a real purpose. Every time I get on a bombing run, I'm burning with rage, inhuman rage. And it only gets worse every mission. I can do so little, and there are so many of them still left out there..."\n\n"I know, Captain, sir. Our own personal war, huh? Me too, when I take off, I worry a little, but I just think of my brother and it all goes away. By the time the target's in sight, I'm good and ready. I don't care if I die. I just want to get those bastards."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nOn the 15th of July the Central Front joined the offensive after holding back a relentless German advance for ten days. Our offensive is directed at Kromy, strategically the most important town in this region. \n\nOur 13th Army has been on the defensive since the 5th and is understandably weakened. Despite this, they are expected to break through the enemy fortifications, which the Germans have been preparing for almost a year. \n\nOne of our advancing regiments is being held back by enemy artillery near Trosna. The artillery is expected to be located somewhere in the forest near the Trosna - Rzhava road junction. \n\nYour Target: enemy artillery\n\nYour Flight: 3 Pe-2 / 110.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:20, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climbing to 1,000 m, head to Kostino, then Nikolskoe. Turn to target after passing Glazunovka. Conduct level bombing on target from 1,000 m. \n\n
