Description \nStriking Trosna\n\nDate: 20th of July, 1943 \nTime: 16:00 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Somovo\n\nThe German offensive is down! On the 16th of July our 3rd and 63rd armies went on the offensive along the entire length of the Bryansk front, and advanced into enemy-held territory by as much as 22 kilometers. Germans mounted desperate attempts to hold us back and the advance slowed down, but the Germans were unable to stop or reverse it. All along our advance on Orel the enemy conducted one counter-attack after another, using concentrated infantry and armor and massively supporting them from the air.\n\nIntel reports suggest that the German command has recently transferred up to four infantry, one motorized, and seven tank divisions into this area. Anticipating this, Stavka has committed our reserves, the 3rd Guards Tank Army, under General Rybalko.\n\nOn the 19th of July, Stavka committed more reserves to the offensive, sending the 3rd Guards Tank Army under General Rybalko to fight with the Bryansk Front. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nBy the 17th of July, German units had retreated back to positions they had occupied prior to beginning their offensive two weeks before. The 13th, 48th, 70th and 2nd tank armies continue their offensive towards their strategic objective, Kromy. \n\nThe path to Kromy is blocked by Trosna, the town which the Germans had extensively fortified in the past year. Heavy fighting on the approach to Trosna temporarily halted our advance. In order to relieve some of the pressure, air units are directed towards Trosna.\n\nYour Objective: Search and destroy enemy defenses near Trosna \n\nYour Flight: 3 Pe-2 / 110.\n\nYour Loadout: 6 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:00, heading West.
