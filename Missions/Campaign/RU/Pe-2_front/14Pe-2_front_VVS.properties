Description \nJuly heat\n\nDate: 23rd of July, 1943 \nTime: 18:25 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Somovo\n\n"So, my friends, how are you feeling?" I was addressing the first flight in the shade of the trees. "Weather getting to you?"\n\n"Yeah, a little bit, Sir, been really hot lately."\n\n"What did you expect? It's the end of July."\n\n"What did I expect? I expect a different kind of heat, like the one in Stalingrad last winter. The heat of battle, not of sitting around in the sun."\n\n"Ha! Well, that won't last for long, I guarantee you. You'll be wishing you were back under these trees soon enough. We should be out there by this evening. So, those of you who were planning to relax a little more - don't even think about it. You understand? No drinking!"\n\n"Of course we understand. Where would we even get liquor, honestly?"\n\n"Don't think I don't know about that moonshine you've been buying in the village. And don't think you'll be able to keep it all for yourself."\n\nOur political Commissar ordered us to work more on troop morale, so hopefully that'd satisfy him. If only I could get more Communist Youth members to join the Party... I hated those talks, but what could I do? I couldn't let that show. At least this time it'd be simple, all I had to do was read the Communist Youth Statement to the member pilots.\n\nCommissar Sivtzev found me reading the Statement.\n\n"Ah, Captain, don't let me prevent you from reading that important document!"\n\nSivtzev sat down in the grass, took out his notebook and began taking notes. Everyone pretended not to notice. He was a secretive man, without any friends. No one had any idea what he thought of anyone. Even Morozov was afraid of the Commissar.\n\nFortunately, a runner from CP interrupted our idyllic gathering. We were being scrambled.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nDespite all their efforts, the 13th Army is unable to advance and is taking increasing casualties from German artillery and air strikes.
