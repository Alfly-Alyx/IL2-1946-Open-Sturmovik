Description \nDeeper into it.\n\nDate: 6th of July, 1943\nTime: 06:45\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ognevka\n\nYesterday the regiment suffered catastrophic casualties. Eight aircraft in a single day. Seven shot down behind enemy lines. One more, flown by Lt. Kolyshkin, managed to make it to our side of the front. Kolyshkin and his navigator returned to the airfield late in the evening. Their gunner, Zaitzev, stayed with the plane and was killed during the air battle.\n\nHundreds of planes from both sides met in the air yesterday. I and many other pilots saw the newest German plane with our own eyes for the first time. The "Fokker" as we called it, the FW-190, had superior airspeed and armament. A Pe-2 didn't have much going for it against such a flying artillery brigade. Another reason why we got it so bad last night was our own commanders. Most of the time there was little coordination between fighters and bombers. Our crates were often left there all alone, at the mercy of those Fokkers. Everyone's eyes scanning the skies, we did little to disrupt enemy movements on the ground.\n\nAt the end of the day our political officer, Sivtzev, made a speech. He told us more about the enemy offensive. After a fierce artillery barrage, at 5:30 in the morning the Fascists struck towards Orel. General Pukhovs 13th Army took the main blow, and Romanenkovs 48th and Galanins 70th Armies got plenty of heat too. The enemy's advance tore a hole 30 miles wide through our lines. The Germans planned to get as far as the village of Olkhovatka by the end of the day. They had nine divisions in the fight, two of them Panzer with almost five hundred tanks. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nCentral Front Command orders the 16th BA to subject the enemy to constant bombardment along the front line, as well as its rear. This will weaken their advance and relieve some of the pressure on the 13th Army. Considering the mistakes of the previous day, the BA command promises that the fighter cover on July the 6th will be coordinated better. The regiment is ordered, firstly, to the Kromy village, where the enemy is reported to have stores of ammunition and fuel.\n\nYour Target: Kromy fuel dump.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 84.\n \nYour Loadout: 6 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:45, heading west. Flight route is marked on your maps. Proceed in formation at 1,000 meters towards Somovo, where you'll rendezvous with your escort. Proceed at 2,000 m through Gubkino and Maloarchangelsk towards Nikolskoe. Your IP is in the L12 quadrant. Conduct level bombing on primary target.\n\n
