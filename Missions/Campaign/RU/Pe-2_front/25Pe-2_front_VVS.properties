Description \nThe Beginning.\n\nDate: 1st of May, 1945 \nTime: 05:30 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Debno\n\nOn the 30th of April, 1945, Red Army soldiers flew the red flag of victory over the Reichstag. Our squadron got the news even before it was announced on the radio. Matrenichev saw it from the air. He buzzed the flight line, landed, taxiing at insane speeds. He opened the cockpit window, stuck his head out, and yelled "We won! We won! Victory!"\n\nThe airfield exploded. People screamed, laughed, danced, and fired in the air. I was also in there somewhere, my mind completely lost in the moment.\n\nThe planes scheduled for a mission stopped, the crews poured out, and the planes that landed never even taxied to their spots. The airfield was in chaos. Commissar Sivtzev ran out, tried to restore order, and fired warning shots in the air. No one noticed him. Sivtzev took a deep breath, threw down his cap, and merged into the crowd. I'm pretty sure he kissed me.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nOnly isolated pockets of sporadic defense remain in Berlin. We are ordered to bomb one of them downtown, near the junction of the Spree River and Landwehr canal. \n\nYour Target: concentration of infantry and vehicles in downtown Berlin.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:30, heading north-West. Flight route and targets are marked on your maps. Climb to 3,000 m. Carry out precision dive-bombing on target.\n\n
