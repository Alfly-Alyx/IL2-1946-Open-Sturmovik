Description \nThe Bridge\n\nDate: 26th of April, 1945 \nTime: 07:30 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Debno\n\nThe 25th of April was a big day in the Berlin offensive. The 1st Byelorussian and 1st Ukrainian fronts linked up that day near Potsdam, completely surrounding the enemy capital. Meanwhile house-to-house fighting in Berlin intensified. Germans fought for every street corner, for every house, for every floor. There's plenty of friendly fire from both sides, and the rumor is, some of our planes have been bombing our own tanks.\n\nElsewhere in the Battle, our assault units have completely cleared the Tegel Forest of German units. And West of Berlin, on the river Elbe, our 58th infantry division linked up with the US 69th infantry. The end is getting ever closer.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nDue to intense close combat in Berlin, the ever-changing situation, and low visibility because of  ground smoke, only the most experienced crews will be allowed over Berlin. \n\nA flight of our most experienced veterans is ordered to bomb the Spree river bridge in the North-Western part of Berlin.\n\nYour Target: Spree river bridge.\n\nYour Flight: 3 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:30. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 500 m. Do not exceed this altitude. Drop bombs from level flight.\n\n
