Description \nRailway Crossing\n\nDate: 7th of July, 1943 \nTime: 08:00\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Ognevka\n\nI barely knew what I was doing as I was coming in to land. My eyes were seeing rainbows as my arms and legs were doing their dance. Thankfully, my navigator caught the look in my eyes, glanced ahead, and screamed in my ear.\n\n"What are you, nuts? Look what you're doing! You're landing across the runway!"\n\nA drawn-out curse followed and brought me back down to Earth.\n\nWe landed all right, and I was fast asleep the second I taxied to our spot and applied the brakes. I dreamt of the burning planes I had just seen, plummeting down helplessly, smudged crosses zooming above the flaming debris. Our escort never got off the ground, attacked at their airfield by a German welcoming party. We attacked naked. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nMeanwhile on July 5th and 6th heavy fighting continued near Olkhovatka. Germans broke through Pukov's 13th and advanced eight kilometers in. Central Front command tried to mount a counter-attack with 13th Army's reserves, the 2nd Tank army and the 19th Tank Brigade. But the counter-attack choked on German heavy tanks and recoiled. The counter-attack was not, however, completely ineffective. Seeing that they were not invulnerable, the Germans regrouped and ceased the advance towards Olkovka. Instead they shifted their push towards Ponyri. \n\nThat's where they got stuck in the early morning of July the 6th, and that's where they met their match. A strong group of our defenses repealed all three of their attacks that day. The Germans never reached Ponyri.\n\nToday, our regiment has the most complex task. We are to bomb the German supply lines, attempting to disrupt their ability to continue their advance.\n\nYour Target: railway crossing in the I13 quadrant.\n \nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 84.\n \nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 08:00, heading west. Flight route is marked on your maps. Proceed in formation at 1,000 meters towards Somovo, where you'll rendezvous with your escort. Proceed towards the M13 quadrant at 2,000 m. Conduct level bombing on primary target.\n\n
