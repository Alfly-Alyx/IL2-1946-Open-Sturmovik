Description \nKing Tigers\n\nDate: 18th of April, 1945 \nTime: 09:00 \nWeather: Foggy\nLocation: Debno\n\nTwo days into the offensive, and I'm already exhausted. Two, three missions a day is hard to sustain, and yesterday some had to do four. We've already lost five planes, with full crews. No-one saw any parachutes, and even if they had, what chance would those guys have, bailing out over those desperate Germans below?\n\nIt's hard to comprehend the extent of physical and nervous exhaustion during days like these. You don't even fully grasp it yourself, you're too tired to think, and by the time it's over, you hardly remember a thing. All your strength is spent trying to keep that crate flying, trying to put those bombs on target. The things you do disappear from memory as soon as they're done.\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nGermans are hurriedly concentrating their reserves around their third line of defense, the last one intact on the path of the 1st Byelorussians advance on Berlin. They commit everything - obsolete tanks and guns, incompetent old men and children, flying bombs. Germans mine everything they can as they retreat, and blow up the rest of it. \n\nWe are ordered to strike the concentration of enemy reserves deep into the enemy defenses. Photo recon just reported that a small village on the Berlin - Frankfurt autobahn is housing a battalion of heavy tanks. Our 779th has been ordered to destroy them.\n \nYour Target: heavy tanks.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 2 FAB-500 + 2 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 09:00, heading north-West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3,000 m. Dive-bomb the target.\n\n
