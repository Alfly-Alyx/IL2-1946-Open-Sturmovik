Description \nThrough the fire\n\nDate: 17th of April, 1945 \nTime: 16:50 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Debno\n\n"Can you feel it, Palochkin? Can you smell the end of this damn thing?''\n\nMy friend, a Senior Lieutenant by now, and I, were walking to our barracks at twilight. Palochkin was the commander of our second flight, a weathered veteran, one of our deadliest. \n\n"I can smell it all right; I just wish I could live long enough to see it. How many fighters do the Germans have here? They said 3,000 on the radio, can this be right? And the flak here! Whole divisions of them in a single town, and these guys know what they're doing."\n\nI sighed. \n\n"Yes, like they say, the final battle is always the hardest."\n\n"Ah, you know, the more you think of death, the closer you get to it. What can we do about it anyway? Just gotta do our part. After all, victory is certain now. Even if we die, what will it matter? So let's concentrate on our mission, huh?"\n\n"Sounds good."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe 1st Byelorussian Front has annihilated the first line of German defense, and is continuing to fight near Seelow Heights.\n\nWe were unable to launch our flight on the morning of the 17th of April because of bad Weather. By the afternoon our troops took Seelow Heights, and broke through the second line of defense. The Weather was getting better, and we were ordered to Neuehardenberg, East of Berlin. \n\nYour Target: German airfield at Neuehardenberg.\n\nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Loadout: 4 FAB-250.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:50, heading North-west. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3,000 m. Dive-bomb the target. Each flight has its target. Your flight has been assigned the transport planes in the South-West sector of the airfield. \n\nYou will be escorted by 4 Yak-3s of the 282nd IAD.\n\n
