Description \nAs the Sun Rises\n\nDate: 10th of July, 1943 \nTime: 05:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ognevka\n\nOn the 9th, the Germans made their last attempt to break through the 307th at Ponyri. More Panzers were committed, and the Germans took the Southern part of town. However they failed to hold on to it. Our reserves counter-attacked with tanks of their own, and the Germans retreated.\n\nFighting was equally fierce on the left flank of the 13th Army at Olkhovatka. A string of attacks and counter-attacks weakened both sides without any significant changes to the front line.\n\nWe woke up early the next day, at 4 am. The flights would be taking off by 5. We lived in an old school house, five minutes away from the field. I didn't even wait for the truck and walked instead. I wasn't hungry. Usually the hunger would hit by dinner time, after all the flying was over.\n\nThe Sun hadn't risen yet. Fresh wind from the North revived me somewhat. There was a cold front there, and we could expect gusty winds and other nice surprises like that. As I neared the airfield I could hear the hum. The mechanics had spent a sleepless night running the engines, patching together our old Peshkas.\n\n"Comrade Sr. Lieutenant, Comrade Sr. Lieutenant!" Somebody called me from the dark.\n\nI looked around and saw Sergeant Palochkin, one of the new replacements.\n\n"Comrade Sr. Lieutenant, may I join you?" He said, catching up. "I can't sleep either. Never thought it'd be so hard to fall asleep after getting tired during the day. After all that flying yesterday, I didn't get any shut-eye at all."\n\n"No worries, Palochkin." I said. "That's normal. Was it your first combat yesterday?"\n\n"Ah, yeah."\n\n"You'll get used to it. I guess your body just needs to adjust,  and soon enough you'll be falling asleep like never before."\n\n"Really, Sir?" He smiled. "That'd be nice."\n\n"Tell me, Palochkin, how was your first combat mission?"\n\nHe frowned.\n\n"Don't remember much. I remember the take-off, remember the jolt as we dropped our eggs. Then the Messers came out of nowhere, everyone was screaming. Barely remember anything after that." He looked at me, as if expecting me to laugh. \n\n"Exactly the same as my first mission." I said. "Don't worry about it. Stay in formation, you'll be fine. Germans don't like to attack formations that much. Stay together, you'll live longer."\n\nWe kept talking all the way to the airfield. Palochkin was a country boy, simple and genuine, spoke his mind. I sent him off to breakfast, and went to the CP to get my orders.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nCommand of the 241st BAD orders more air strikes on enemy supply points in the rear. \n\nYour Target: Tagino.\n \nYour Flight: 9 Pe-2 / 84.\n\nYour Loadout: 6 FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:00, heading West.
