Description \nSouth of Rasin\n\nDate: 10th of August, 1945\nTime: 06:30\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Sukhaya Rechka\n\nOne after another Il-10s touched down at Sukhaya Rechka. Life was quickly becoming routine again. We even kept attacking the same target, time and again. Exhausted after the first ever day of combat, some of the air crews sat at the mess hall digging buckwheat trenches with their forks. Most went straight to their bunks and shut off. \n\nMyself and other squadron commanders stayed at the CP, finalizing our daily reports. Based on follow-up recon missions, our second strike failed to sink any ships, and only damaged one.\n\nMajor Nikolaev, or CO, was in high spirits.\n\n"Great job, falcons! My thanks to all of you! Wonderful results today, wonderful. Our bosses out here are very generous with rewards, so why don't you write up some recommendations, and I'll do a few of my own."\n\nI had a feeling Nikolaev would be one of the first getting a new medal. Of course, after sitting out the war with Germany, the men in the Far East were eager to get some medals for themselves. I stood out like a sore thumb with my three jingling rows; everybody else had one or two peacetime awards at most. I took a deep breath, but I just couldn't control myself.\n\n"Sir, with all due respect, awards for what? We didn't even sink anything. When we fought with Germany..."\n\n"You're not in Germany any more. Times change, Kozlovzev, times change." Nikolaev didn't seem one bit offended. "Life's life. You gotta seize the day. Understood?"\n\n"Understood, sir."\n\n"Great. Don't take this the wrong way. I still want results, and I still want complete dedication. Make me proud... All right, everyone's dismissed. I'll see you guys tomorrow morning. My place."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nI downed my frontline-hundred-grams sitting on the barracks porch. The trick was not to swallow, just to pour it in. I listened to the rain for a few minutes, and then went to my bunk and my eyelids finally closed shut. After what seemed like a second, my eyes opened automatically, and I was wide awake. 5 am, right on the clock, as usual.\n\nThe rain stopped, and the new dawn was beginning to glow in the East. The strong breeze from the bay was chilly, unsummerlike. I flagged down a supply truck, hopped on, and jumped off at the squadron CP. Slowly other pilots began to gather inside. I greeted each one, made sure they slept well. A couple of them didn't sleep through the night, so I grounded them for the day. There were probably more people like them, but after I grounded those two, everybody else reported that they slept like babies. I knew last night was difficult for these guys; in war, airfields are alive 24 hours a day, and it's not easy to get a good night's sleep with trucks roaring by, airplane engines being run up next door, and aircraft weapons being test-firing to check their alignment. \n\nAt 05:30 most of the pilots went to get their breakfast. Getting a frontline ration for the first time in their lives, I knew they wouldn't miss it. I just had a glass of hot water as usual, and went down to the hangars. \n\nMy Il-10 looked huge from outside, a mighty predator basking in the morning sunlight. Gun muzzles stuck out like talons, rockets with red tips under the wings like swords dipped in blood. \n\nThe mechanics were sitting on some crates behind the plane, smoking. They jumped up when they saw me, saluted, and the chief mechanic made his report. I saluted back and did my walk around quietly, deliberately, carefully. The plane was impeccable. I shook the mechanic's hands. \n\nFive minutes later I reported in to get my orders. This time they were simple. Four Il-10s needed to fly out to Rasin, to search along the railroad leading South, and to destroy enemy trains, especially the ones moving into the city. \n\nYour Objective: destroy enemy trains south of Rasin.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:30 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,300 meters.\n\n
