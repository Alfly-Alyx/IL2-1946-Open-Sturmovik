Description \nBusse's Last Hope\n\nDate: 26th of April, 1945\nTime: 06:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\nUnits of the 1st Byelorussian and 1st Ukrainian Fronts finally linked up around Berlin. The encirclement around Third Reich's capital was complete. The ultimate victory was assured. It was just a matter of time. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThere were plenty of other smaller encirclements around Berlin. Many German units were cut off from the city before they could reach it, and now fought desperately to link up, or to break through into their doomed capital. To the South-East, one of the encircled units was General Busse's IX Army with elements of Frankfurt-an-der-Oder garrison. They received news that General Wenck's XII Army to the west of their positions was attempting to fight their way through. Busse made a decision to advance towards Wenck, link up, and to combine forces to try to break through to Berlin. \n\nThe IX Army attacked at down on the 26th, pouring into a weaker spot in the rear guard of the 1st Ukrainian Front. German soldiers frantically clawed at their last chance, knowing full well they'd never get another. \n\nIl-2s had been making their lives miserable for a few days, and after the counter-attack began, the HQ decided to send the IL-10s in as well.\n\nYour Objective: strike enemy vehicles in the counter-attack region.\n\nYour Flight: 2 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 2 x FAB-100 + 4 x BRS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 06:00 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Location of your targets is marked on your map. Your primary targets are enemy vehicles and tanks. \n\n
