Description \nAirfield Strike\n\nDate: 10th of August, 1945\nTime: 19:15\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Sukhaya Rechka\n\nAfter the morning sortie I stuck around by my plane, discussing something with the mechanics. There was something wrong with the back of my seat, and I was asking if they could file off or do something about the rivets that were chewing holes through my shoulder blades. The mechanics look stunned. Suddenly somebody tapped me on my shoulder.\n\n"Captain, may I speak with you sir?"\n\nI turned around and saw Lieutenant Sachkov, a young kid we received a few months ago straight from flight school. \n\n"What is it?"\n\n"I... I need to talk to you, sir."\n\n"Go right ahead."\n\n"Ah... Privately?"\n\nHow saucy. "Sure, Sahckov, no problem."\n\nWe walked through the grass quietly. I lit up a cigarette, offered one to Sachkov. I could see he was nervous. \n\n"Well, what's the matter, lieutenant?"\n\n"Sir, I just can't do it. Can you... I can't shoot up train cars like that. There are people there, defenseless, just sitting with nowhere to go. I'm a combat pilot, I need to go to the battlefield and hit enemy troops... Not this. When you're assigning pilots in future missions, can you just..."\n\nI sighed. "Why don't we go to the political officer, Sachkov."\n\nLieutenant's eyes opened wide.\n\n"Don't worry Sachkov, relax. Gerasimov's a great guy, not one of those... He'll help you out, much better than I ever could."\n\nSachkov nodded, not fully believing me. He seemed resigned to his fate as we went around the airfield looking for Major Gerasimov. We found him in the kitchen, flirting with the truck-sized waitresses. I gave him the gist of things. He took off his officer's hat and wiped the sweat off his bald spot.\n\n"What can I say, Lieutenant Sahckov. I understand you perfectly. Let's all sit down."\n\nWe each grabbed an aluminum stool with a wooden top, and sat down in the corner. Major leisurely unbuckled his map case, thumbed through the contents, and took out a newspaper. Red Soldier, a particular favorite of the lower rank, printed on thin waxy paper perfect for rolling your own cigarettes.\n\nGerasimov unfolded the paper, and spent a few seconds reading through it, looking for something.\n\n"Here's something written just for you, Sachkov. Listen carefully."\n\nMajor read a long article by a front-correspondent Shlyapkin, describing the Chinese village liberated by the 1st Red Banner Army. All the Japanese in the village were shot in the process, of course, and then the Chinese poured out, waving red flags. They were happy beyond belief. As they said, the Japanese had arrived five years prior, evicted all the Chinese from their homes, and forbade any non-Japanese to enter the village, under the penalty of death. This was followed by a long list of other crimes committed by the Japanese in the village.\n\n"You see, Lieutenant, you're not fighting people. You're fighting animals, rabid beasts. Creatures like that don't deserve our pity. They deserve death, and nothing but, in whichever shape it comes. They burned, robbed, and raped the inhabitants of a peaceful village, poor peasants who didn't have anyone to stand up for them. But now, the workers' and peasants' Red Army is here. We're liberating the working class from vile oppressors. And you seriously think those oppressors deserve your pity?"\n\nSkachkov's face was changing as if by magic. His eyes were burning, lips pressed tightly together, and his fists were clenched. I felt dirty for brining the poor kid to Gerasimov, but what else could I do? Really select his missions for him? We'd both get court-martialed. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nIn the evening, as usual, squadron commanders gathered at the CP to get their orders. In my case, I was to send three zvenos to Kwangok-Tong, a Japanese airfield located between Rasin and Yuki. \n\nI planned the mission to ingress over the sea, and to use terrain features to hide from the flak gunners as long as possible. \n\nYour Objective: strike the airfield at Kwangok-Tong.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 19:15 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Your strike targets are marked on your maps. Your zveno's targets are enemy planes parked along the Southern side of the field.\n\n
