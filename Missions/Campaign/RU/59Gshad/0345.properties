Description \nTanks are breaking through\n\nDate: 16th of April, 1945\nTime: 18:45\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Sulechow\n\nI met the two perpetrators at the CP after the mission. Lieutenants Aleksandrov and Znamenski didn't look too upset that they abandoned me and Kuzmin to attack German positions by ourselves. Both saluted me and Aleksandrov reported that, as soon as he took off, his oil pressure dropped and the engine began to lose power. He reported this on his radio, turned around towards the airfield, and then the engine sneezed and cut off. Thankfully, he had enough altitude to make it back to the runway.\n\nZnamenski heard nothing but static in his earphones, couldn't get anybody to answer him, so he assumed that the mission was cancelled and followed his leader back to the field, overtaking his plane in the process and thinking nothing of it, then cheerfully landing and taxiing to his parking space without looking back.\n\nAleksandrov groundlooped his plane, but got away with just a few nicks and bruises. The only positive outcome was that the commission from the people's commissars of aviation industry was there to witness the entire incident. By the time I returned from my mission, they had already investigated the wreck, found the faulty engine rod, and made a note of the flaw in their official report. \n\n\nMeanwhile the slaughter continued on the approaches to Seelow Heights. Despite the downpour of artillery fire, the German defense looked fully intact, and our infantry units bogged down trying to advance on their positions. Oder's flood plain was a very difficult terrain for ground units. They advanced slowly along the swampy ground, receiving constant fire from the heights, and taking heavy losses without inflicting any on the enemy. 1st Byelorussian Front's headquarters were completely overwhelmed. Encrypted reports were coming in from the frontline units in an endless stream, and the few decipherers at the HQ were utterly unable to decipher them and then encrypt the responses in time to provide any kind of meaningful control. Within a few hours after the offensive started, it descended into chaos. Most units had to act on their own initiative, unable to get any direction from above. Artillery units continued to fire on German positions for hours after Soviet units had taken them, and losses to friendly fire were approaching thousands. Berlin no longer seemed so close.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nBy the mid-afternoon it became clear to everyone that the initial plan had failed, and Berlin would not be in our hands within five days. Zhukov was becoming nervous and started making rash decisions. Desire to be the first to enter Berlin overwhelmed reason, and he went all out and committed his reserves. \n\nMarshal Katukov's tank guards crossed the river and roared through the mud towards the Heights. \n\nThe front line was in complete disarray. Advancing tanks rolled over their own infantry, passed through the make-shift hospitals, overtook other advancing units. In the colossal uncontrollable mess the units seemed to be moving in every direction; and without any knowledge of the disposition of friendly units around then, advancing rear guard would often fire at the retreating forward units, believing they were a German counter-attack. Mortar and artillery barrages from the Germans seemed almost an afterthought.\n\nKatukov's tanks found some early successes, spurring on the stalled advance and moving even deeper into German-held territory, but then came under murderous fire from German anti-tank guns and also became mired. Our tanks urgently needed air support.\n\nYour Objective: strike enemy defensive positions along the Southern edge of Seelow Heights. \n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 2 x FAB-100 + 4 x BRS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:45 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Your targets, situated on the Seelow Heights, are artillery units, assault guns and panzer units in direct contact with our advancing tanks. \n\nThe area is patrolled by our fighters, so in case of trouble request their assistance.\n\n
