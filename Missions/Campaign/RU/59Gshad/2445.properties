Description \nMudanjiang Train Station\n\nDate: 14th of August, 1945\nTime: 10:40\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Pogranichniy\n\nAll day we kept receiving conflicting reports from our forward units, now a long flight away. The advance was not a continuous wall, but rather a myriad of little probes poking through the fog and looking for the enemy's disjointed defenses. Shock units, made up of a few tanks and some infantry, were moving ahead, bypassing any resistance they found. Enemy positions they located were then cleaned out by larger infantry units to their rear. We keep watching an endless supply column moving by our airfield. Heavy guns, pontoons, rocket artillery, ammunition, all moving at a snail's pace, all that seemed hopelessly behind the advance. Most of the forward units were not getting what they need and had to improvise. I guess this was as expected in mountainous terrain. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe town of Hualing changed hands several times during the 13th of August. As most of the fighting was between infantry units, it was deemed too dangerous to send sturmoviks to the area, and we were switched over to Mudanjiang itself. \n\nOur first sortie on the 14th would be a strike against the railway station inside the city. A large formation, 14 IL-10s, was allocated for the mission. Six of the sturmoviks were dedicated to flak suppression, and the remaining 8 were to hit the railway junction itself. Air recon promised plenty of train cars and vehicles.\n\nYour Objective: strike the railway stations.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:40 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,400 meters. Your targets are marked on your maps. Your formation will be covered by La-7s, although intel believes no enemy fighters remain in the area. \n\n
