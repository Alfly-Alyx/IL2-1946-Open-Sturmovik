Description \nTaking Mudanjiang\n\nDate: 16th of August, 1945\nTime: 07:40\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Pogranichniy\n\nThe weather was lousy on the 15th, and we stayed grounded all day, despite the pleas from the ground units. We enjoyed the breather. After all, the squadron's been engaged in combat non-stop for almost a week, flying multiple sorties every day. The aircrews were exhausted, but the mechanics fared even worse, most of them getting no more than three hours of sleep a day since the war began. \n\nDuring the lull I got a phone call from my old CO, Major Nikolaev. He was still at Sukhaya Rechka, commanding the remaining squadrons of the regiment. They haven't flown any combat missions since I left.\n\n"I've got great news from you, Kozlovzev." Nikolaev said. "Just got the papers. The Military Academy's waiting for you. You are to report there on September 1st. So why don't you wrap up your war, and get a transport down here to pick up your orders."\n\n"Yes, sir."\n\n"What do you mean, yes sir? Aren't you happy?"\n\n"Oh, I am, sir. Overwhelmed... I do have one request though."\n\n"Shoot."\n\n"One more sortie. W'eve been working towards this goal for a week, and tomorrow our troops will finally try to take this city, Mudankiang. Can I fly over there and say goodbye to our gracious hosts the Japanese?"\n\n"All right. You got it. But just one more sortie and that's it, all right?"\n\n"Yes sir. Thank you."\n\n"Be home by lunch tomorrow, you hear?"\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nQuite the end to my career. I've been flying Ilyushin sturmoviks for four years, with only two breaks - once in '41 after being wounded by Guderian's flak guns, and then just last week, between the two wars. After going across Europe twice, first back and then forward, and then switching over to a completely different war on a different continent, I was almost glad it was over this way. The Soviet Union had no more enemies left. I've had enough war for my lifetime. \n\nEarly in the morning our forward units entered Mudanjuang. The town was surrounded, and it didn't look like the Japanese were going to surrender. \n\nOur tanks were moving in from the south, but well-camouflaged anti-tank artillery stopped their advance. An urgent air strike was needed. This would be my final mission. Could be better, but I had to be at Sukhaia Rechka by lunch. \n\nYour Objective: destroy enemy guns at Mudanjiang.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:40 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,400 meters. Your targets, shown on your maps, are enemy anti-tank guns on the Southern side of town. You will be escorted by Yak-3s.\n\n
