Description \nSecond Rasin Strike\n\nDate: 9th of August, 1945\nTime: 17:30\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Sukhaya Rechka\n\nIt was incredible how quickly one got used to peacetime. The absence of danger for three months made my first combat of the new war seem like my first combat ever. I was scared out of my mind. Take-off in poor visibility, wheels sinking into the rain-soaked runway, raindrops streaming along the canopy being the only thing visible during the ingress, and then sudden flak bursts all around, all these things no longer seemed routine and made me want to throw up. I wondered how it must have felt for the others, after 15 years of peacetime flying. At the very least, they flew formation in poor visibility like Gods. I made a mental note to never, ever fly in any position with these guys but the flight leader. \n\nWe suffered our first casualty, too. Again, this was much more painful to handle than I expected. I didn't even know the guy. Sr Lieutenant Kravtzov got a direct hit just as he was pulling up after a firing pass. His engine started billowing smoke and he ran to the side, deeper into the Japanese territory. He didn't respond to my radio calls. A few hours after landing we received reports of a smoking sturmovik that crashed into a hillside ways to the north. It was probably Kravtzov, wounded and disoriented. There were no other sturmoviks missing in the region. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAfter we landed, the pilots wandered off to the mess hall, exhausted by the long flight and the difficult battle. The mechanics scurried about the planes. The greenhorns didnt recognize the signs, but I did. One of the first things the mechanics did was to load up new bombs. \n\nAfter lunch, squadron commanders were called to HQ, and we received our new orders. \n\nWe were going right back to Rasin. It seemed to be somebody's favorite target. Our airfield was jammed with bombers and sturmoviks, going back and forth to that unfortunate little port. \n\nOur Il-10s were to take-off at 17:30. We decided to change our route, and to make a wider curve around the city in order to surprise the flak gunners. This time, we'd dedicate two zvenos to flak suppression, and only one for the actual strike.\n\nYour Objective: strike enemy transport vessels moored around the port of Rasin. \n\nYour Flight: 8 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:30 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,300 meters. Your targets are large enemy transports.\n\n
