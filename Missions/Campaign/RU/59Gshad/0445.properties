Description \nBusse's Final Reserves\n\nDate: 18th of April, 1945\nTime: 15:00\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Sulechow\n\nAfter my landing an entire crew of mechanics had to liberate me from my cockpit. It took four men and a few good whacks with a hammer to pry the canopy open. If this had happened after a forced landing, or worse yet in the air in a burning plane, the results could have been much more serious. This was yet another defect in our new plane. I couldn't hold back a few choice words in my report to the people's commissars commission. \n\nThere was plenty of other stuff, too. Every sturmovik pilot who had previously flown the Il-2 was very unhappy with Il-10s visibility. The rear quarter was especially bad: it was completely obscured. In the Il-2 the pilot could at least get some idea of what was happening behind him, but in the Il-10 one couldn't even turn around and see the results of his attack. We made a request to the commission to add to their report that the plane needed the same kind of an armored seat back as the Il-2, with glass cut-outs on the sides.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThroughout the 17th of April we stayed grounded. After one day of combat, all of us had gotten plenty of impressions, and a much better idea of the kind of plane the Il-10 was. The commission interviewed us all, and made notes of everything. The mechanics were also busy the whole day. Many planes came back with battle damage that needed to be patched up; and plenty of others were breaking down on their own. We even had a few control lines that snapped in mid-air. \n\nThe battle continued at Seelow Heights. Katukov's tanks tried to break straight through, but suffered tremendous casualties from anti-tank artillery and Volkssturm units with their panzerfausts and panzerschrecks.  The entire area was covered with hulls of T-34s and IS-2s emitting thick greasy smoke. However our numerical superiority was so great, there was only direction for this battle to go. By the end of the second day, Seelow Heights were ours. German defenses were broken, and we were mopping them up on the Western side of the hills.  \n\nIn the morning of the 18th of April, the weather was non-flying, so we just sat at the CP and waited. Winds came after lunch, and I was called up to regiment to receive my orders.\n\nAccording to reports from the front, our forward units north of the Seelow Heights broke through to Reichsstrasse 1, the highway to Berlin. In a desperate attempt to stop their advance the enemy counterattacked with their last reserves. HQ ordered an urgent sturmovik strike on the reinforcements approaching the Reichsstrasse from the West. \n\nYour Objective: search and destroy German columns approaching Reichsstrasse 1. \n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 15:00 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Initiate the attack run from the South. Your primary targets are enemy vehicles and tanks approaching the front line along the autobahn. \n\n
