Description \nTraffic Jam\n\nDate: 18th of April, 1945\nTime: 19:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Sulechow\n\nThe late afternoon was the busiest in some months. Things were happening faster than we could process them. The 2nd squadron's Il-10s, led by Captain Krainov, annihilated a small German village after they observed large numbers of infantry and a few tanks moving through there. On Krainov's map the village looked so deep inside German-held territory he didn't even bother to check, and calmly ordered his flight to flatten that village ten ways to Sunday. As his Il-10s were coming in to land, a SMERSH unit was waiting for them by the hangars. Apparently, the infantry they strafed was friendly. Thankfully, the SMERSH wasn't too serious about this. All involved pilots were held in one of the hangars while Krainov was driven up to the HQ of the unit he attacked to apologize.\n\nKrainov was back the next morning, wearing a tanker's helmet and reeking of moonshine. Apparently, while the infantry Krainov hit was friendly, the tanks were German after all. Krainov attacked just as a German counter-attack was retaking the village, and the Il-10s put a stop to it and kept the village in our hands. The losses suffered in taking it, both to enemy and friendly fire, were well within the norm. Infantry general gave Krainov a big hug and the traditional three kisses. Thanks to the Sturmoviks, the village was still in his hands.\n\nAs this was happening, we at the airfield watched an endless column of German POWs staggering by. Most of them were middle-aged unshaved men wearing filthy field-gray overcoats with red arm bands. There were also many defiant teenagers wearing black. Some were broken down, some held their heads up high, some were covered in bandages, some in blood. A few of our younger pilots started screaming "Hitler kaput" and threw rocks at the Germans. The POWs didnt look our way. After a few more tries the trouble-makers looked around and caught the eye of their comrades, and that was the end of their display. The Germans continued on quietly, somehow still managing to keep their interval and march in step.\n\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAs the day was drawing to a close, we received word that the German IX Army under General Busse was breaking down and our tanks were pouring into the fractures in the defensive lines. The situation at Reichsstrasse 1 was the most serious for the Germans. Moving along the nicest highway in Europe, T-34s could pick up speed and break straight through to Berlin. \n\nVolkssturm units and remains of regular infantry were in disorganized retreat, leaving their equipment behind. The roadways in the area were one giant traffic jam, presenting a great target for our sturmoviks. \n\nQuarter to seven I got orders to take four Il-10s to Reichsstrasse 1 and attack the clusters of retreating Germans. \n\nYour Objective: conduct a strike on the concentration of German vehicles and armor along Reichsstrasse 1.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 19:00 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. You are free to choose your own targets in the designated area. Visually identify your targets as hostile before engaging. \n\n
