Description \nMudanjiang Airfield\n\nDate: 12th of August, 1945\nTime: 18:40\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Pogranichniy\n\nOn the 12th, we finally got proper August weather. Sun blazing in the clear sky was heating the airplanes so hot, the pilots couldn't touch the metal, and needed wet towels to climb into their cockpits. Clouds of insects from the swamps took to the air, launching merciless strikes on all airfield personnel, from private to colonel. There was no escaping them. \n\nAfter we returned from Hualing we expected to be done for the day, but the mechanics were already waiting with their bomb dollies. I ate my dinner - beef with potatoes and ersatz coffee - wondering if I'd have to land the squadron after dark. I didn't even want to think about having to navigate home in the moonlight. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nJapanese air force, fully dedicated to defending their home islands from the Americans, had only a token presence in Manchuria. However our units were occasionally struck by IJA planes, mostly hit-and-run attacks by single planes. There have also been reports of suicide pilots exploding into our armored columns. The only airbase they could be coming from was located near the city of Mudanjiang. We were ordered to fly there and to prevent the Japanese from launching any more attacks on our ground units.\n\nYour Objective: strike the enemy airfield at Mudanjiang.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:40 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,400 meters. Your targets are marked on your maps. Watch for flashes when approaching the airfield, note their locations, and suppress enemy flak guns. The second zveno, coming in after you, will attack the parked planes.\nYou will be escorted by a flight of La-7 fighters. \n\n
