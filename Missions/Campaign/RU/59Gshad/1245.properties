Description \nOver Tempelhof\n\nDate: 24th of April, 1945\nTime: 17:45\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\nThe events developed quickly on that April day. By lunch we had exactly four Il-10s in flyable condition. The others, the ones not lost outright, had a plethora of problems ranging from severe battle damage to a plane broken in two in a wheels-up landing. Most of the damaged Il-10s were only useful for spare parts, and would never fly again. \n\nThe people's commissars commission was about to complete its report on the front-line trials of the new sturmovik. Over the past week my own feelings for the plane had changed from apprehension to fondness. Once I stopped expecting it to be just like the old Il-2, my disdain evaporated, and I began to see the peculiarities of the new plane in a different light.  Increased speed was a God-sent, allowing us to hit our targets with less of a notice, and making it more difficult for the flak gunners to track our planes. The plane was fast and maneuverable enough for us to meet enemy fighters on equal terms. And problems with manufacture and certain problematic design decisions were nothing new; as a matter of fact the Il-2s we received early in the war were much more problematic, and often could not fly at all without an extensive overhaul by our mechanics. \n\nUnfortunately, we were thrust into the heat of the world's biggest battle without a chance to get used to our planes first. I was afraid that all the eyes fixed upon us would not understand this, and take our losses as the sign of problems with this plane itself. I hoped my regiment's failure to use the Il-10 properly would not sign the death warrant for this beautiful bird. \n\t\nMission Briefing:\n\nOur howitzers began shelling downtown Berlin on the morning of the 23rd. Soviet shells were exploding within the very buildings where the attack on the Soviet Union was conceived just four years before. At the same time, our infantry was pushing deeper into the city. 8th Guards Army and 5th Shock Army were fighting through the German defenses in the south-east. After crossing the Spree, they were just blocks away from downtown. \n\nAt dawn on the 24th, desperate German High Command launched a hectic counter-attack near Tempelhof. King Tiger tanks and Ferdinand assault guns ran head-first into a formation of T-34s and IS-2s and set many of them on fire at close range. Our ground units converged on the area to crush the counter-attack, with constant assistance from all sturmovik and bomber units in the vicinity of Tempelhof. \n\nYour Objective: strike enemy armored vehicles around the Tempelhof airfield.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 2 x FAB-100 + 4 x BRS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:45 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Initiate your attack from the south. Your targets are enemy armored vehicles at Tempelhof. Priority should be placed on heavy tanks and assault guns. Pay close attention to the targets you attack. You will be working in direct vicinity of our IS-2 tanks.\n\n
