Description \nCounterattack\n\nDate: 19th of April, 1945\nTime: 18:40\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Sulechow\n\nI taxied to the hangars, cut off the engine, and tried to open the canopy. For a second I thought it jammed again, but then realized I simply had no strength left in my arms. Gerasimov, my mechanic, jumped up on the wing and slid the canopy open. Spring air rushed into the cabin, and the windows immediately fogged up from the inside. Gerasimov undid my safety belts, pulled me out, and helped me throw off my chute. \n\nA few minutes later I reported in to Lukyanov. Major was fuming all day, and screamed at anyone he saw since the early morning. Combat losses and operational accidents kept piling up, and the regiment was losing strength. His superiors continued to demand results, deeming the current output insufficient. They were ordering more sorties, and wanted confirmation of more vehicles and men destroyed. With our current strength, their demands were impossible to meet, and in the morning they apparently mentioned the words "court martial".\n\n"Evening Major, sir. May I?"\n\nLukyanov waved at me weakly. "Make your report."\n\n"We just returned from Fuerstenwalde. Over the airfield we were bounced by Messerschmitts, had a bit of a dogfight. Lieutenants Korotkov and Krasnov have not returned to the airfield. Yet."\n\n"What do you mean, yet? What the hell do you mean, yet? Why didn't you regroup after the IP, why didn't you wait for them?"\n\n"Sir, Korotkov and Krasnov did not respond to my commands. I did circle the area while fuel permitted, and continued to hail them. No response. In the heat of battle I just didn't see what happened to them, and there was so much screaming on the radio, I'm afraid..."\n\n"Ah, forget it." Lukyanov sank back into his chair. "What a day... Six Sturmoviks lost in two hours, and now this... Wasn't this supposed to be the end of the war?"\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nMuenchenberg fell, and enemy resistance grew weaker. There were still plenty of defensive lines between our tanks and Berlin however, and the command ordered a halt to our advance, realizing a straight drive to Berlin was out of the question. \n\nThe tanks were instead ordered to expand their gains by enveloping Fuerstenwalde from the south. At 18:20 we were scrambled to Lindenwalde, a village by the bridge south of town. A few heavy panzers were holding the village, and our tanks needed help from above. \n\nYour Objective: strike Lindenwalde, assist our tanks in taking it from German defenders. \n\nYour Flight: 6 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 2 FAB-100 + 4 x BRS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 18:40 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Your targets are enemy tanks defending the village.\n\n
