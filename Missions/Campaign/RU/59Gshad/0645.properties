Description \nFuerstenwalde Airfield\n\nDate: 19th of April, 1945\nTime: 16:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Sulechow\n\nThroughout the 18th of April units of the 1st Byelorussian Front continued to chew through German defenses along Reichsstrasse 1. Our units suffered unprecedented casualties in the process both in personnel and equipment. However our reserves were virtually unlimited, and a constant infusion of fresh blood kept the advance going without skipping a beat. HQ demanded results, pestering frontline commanders incessantly, urging them on, and ordering them to advance even faster, no matter the cost. Zhukov's troops had to be the first in Berlin, ahead of Konev's to the south, and Rokossovsky's to the North. \n\nOur roads leading up to the front were a never-ending stream of freshly painted tanks, self-propelled guns, and trucks loaded with fuel, ammunition, supplies, and troops. Roads to the west of the frontline were very similar  a flood of vehicles slowly moving in the same direction, to Berlin. But in the German retreat more and more civilians were mixing in with the field-gray, and the vehicles, one after another, were being shed away and abandoned by the sides of the roads. I remembered flying over roads just like these in the summer of 1941, and it seemed almost poetic that my revenge on Germany would finally take this shape. As Alexander Nevsky said, one who comes to us with a sword shall die by the sword. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\n1st Byelorussian Front continued to advance throughout the 19th of April. In the morning fresh artillery and tanks continued to amass on the approaches to Muenchenberg, preparing for a noon offensive. Tanks from Katukov's Guards Army, and infantry from Chuikov's 8th Guards were packed into the area tighter than sardines in a can.\n\nA lightning strike that utilized penal units crushed the German resistance and crushed Muenchenberg like an avalanche. The way to Berlin was now open. Katukov's and Chuikov's pincer then split into two wedges, with the main attack continuing on to Berlin, and another thrust veering off to the South, to Fuerstenwalde. Tanks of the 1st Guards ran well ahead of their infantry, and on the approaches to Fuerstenwalde were met with fierce resistance from Volkssturm units and their rocket-propelled grenades. \n\nLuftwaffe airfield at Fuerstenwalde began launching strike missions against our 34s and IS's. Their hit-and-run attacks were not very effective, but did have a debilitating effect on our morale. At this stage of the war, our tank crews were not supposed to worry about what's over their heads, and be fully confident that any plane above them has red stars on its wings. \n\nHQ ordered a constant fighter screen over the area to keep the Luftwaffe down. At 15:50 my squadron received orders to fly to Fuerstenwalde and strike their parked planes.\n\nYour Objective: destroy Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:00 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Your targets are parked aircraft around the airfield. The airfield is heavily defended by AAA. You may dedicate your second zveno to suppressing anti-aircraft guns.\n\n
