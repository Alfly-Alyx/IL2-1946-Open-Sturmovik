Description \nOutskirts of Belrin\n\nDate: 20th of April, 1945\nTime: 17:00\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Sulechow\n\nWe got a little breather after helping Katukov's tanks at Ruedersdorf. A light drizzle decreased the ground visibility to less than 50 meters. As the Il-10 did not have an openable canopy and the pilots could not look over the side to see better, all of us were grounded until the weather improved. Our Il-10s were getting soaked under their masking nets, and the pilots gathered at the CP. Only the 3rd squadron with their old Il-2s continued to fly, pilots' heads sticking out of the open canopies, their planes disappearing into the mist long before the gurgle of their engines was hushed by the rainfall. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe rain did little to stop the advance of Katukov's and Bogdanov's armies. Spurred on by Zhukov's never-ending orders, they continued tearing through the German defenses, taking horrific losses, and advancing. \n\nIt stopped raining in late afternoon, and the clouds began to recede. All Il-10s were urgently scrambled. There were plenty of German anti-tank guns to deal with. \n\nOrders for our squadron were one of the first to arrive. We were to fly to Strausberg, and attack the defenders of the airfield. \n\nYour Objective: strike German infantry and armored vehicles defending Strausberg. \n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:00 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Select your own targets around the airfield, concentrating on any vehicles or guns that can cause problems for our advancing tanks.\n\n
