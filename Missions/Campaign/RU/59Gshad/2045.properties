Description \nThe hunt for the Destroyer.\n\nDate: 11th of August, 1945\nTime: 04:40\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Sukhaya Rechka\n\nA follow-up recon flight confirmed my after-action report. Most of the parked planes were burning, and the runway decorated with clustered craters. The Japanese were hurriedly trying to repair the field. Pacific Fleet HQ was very happy with our results.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nEarly on the 11th of August we got our next orders. According to recon, a Japanese destroyer was seen leaving the Rasin harbor, and going south at full speed. It was assumed that the warship was evacuating something important: equipment, personnel, or maybe documents. The Japanese seemed to know that our amphibious operation was just days away. \n\nOur fleet was unlikely to catch up to the destroyer, so the only way to sink it while it was still in Russian-designated waters was to send sturmoviks on a skip-bombing mission.\n\nYour Objective: sink the enemy destroyer.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 04:40 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 600 meters. Our flying boat is monitoring the warship's movements. So far it continues sailing South through quadrant AF3.\n\n
