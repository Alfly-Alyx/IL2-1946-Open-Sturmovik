Description \nDuel\n\nDate: 20th of April, 1945\nTime: 11:40\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Sulechow\n\nThe Lidenwalde mission showed yet again how easy it was to attack a friendly target. As soon as you become complacent, the moment you drop your guard, your bombs and rockets will be exploding amidst the people you were supposed to protect. The time it takes for the information from the ground to get to your earphones is far too long to permit for any kind of predefined notions to exist in battle. Hills, trenches, villages, entire towns can change hands in the time it takes you to get from the airfield to your designated target.\n\nI was incredibly fortunate to have noticed the familiar silhouettes of the 34s in time. If there was just a bit more flak around me, or worse yet a fighter on my tail, there could have been SMERSH waiting for me at the airfield too. \n\nTheoretically, we were supposed to have direct communication with the "air-directors" on the ground, infantry officers with radio sets tuned to our frequencies. However, it just didn't work that way. In the rare cases when they were ready to talk to us, and actually had the right frequencies, the strength of their transmissions coupled with the general havoc on the radio channel meant that we rarely heard anything through the static but the legendary three-tiered infantry cursing. Besides, it wasn't uncommon for the pilots to just switch off their radios on the approaches to target, especially around Berlin. Radio static here was bad enough to permanently damage your hearing.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\n1st Tank Army's advance in the Fuerstenwalde area was unsuccessful. Separating from their infantry, the 8th Guards, our tanks ran into well-camouflaged Wehrmacht and Volkssturm units, and one after another our tanks were set alight. Receiving constant reports of ever increasing casualties, the HQ finally gave the order to turn the tanks around and wait for the infantry. After regrouping, the tanks were to advance slowly, with infantry support at all times. Their route would once again lead them to Berlin along Reichsstrasse 1.\n\nAt 11:30 on the 20th of April, I was ordered to take four planes to Ruedersdorf, where our tanks were counter-attacked by a Panther battalion and some Pz IVs. Our T-34/85s were a poor match for the Panthers, and we suffered heavy losses in the initial skirmish. We were on the verge of losing momentum, and a previous air strike on the area observed fresh German tanks approaching the battle. More Sturmoviks were needed.\n\nYour Objective: destroy enemy Panzers attempting to join the ongoing battle.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 144 x PTAB-2.5.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 11:40 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Your targets are Panther tanks attempting to reinforce the German counter-attack. Luftwaffe was observed patrolling the area throughout the day, so keep your head on a swivel.\n\n
