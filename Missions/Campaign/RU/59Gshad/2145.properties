Description \nNew Home\n\nDate: 12th of August, 1945\nTime: 07:40\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Pogranichniy\n\nEarly in the afternoon on the 11th, I was ordered to report to the CP. I wondered what was so important. The weather was non-flying, and we usually didn't get our the next day's orders until late night.\n\nAs the CO explained, during our strikes against enemy coastal installations and communication lines, far to the North units of the 1st Red Banner Army continued their advance virtually without air support. Their two pincers were converging on a Japanese citadel, the city of Mudanjiang - the final hurdle before their ultimate goal, Harbin. In only two days, moving across very difficult terrain, our units moved deep into enemy-held territory, and were now within striking distance of their target, the city of Mudanjiang. Commanders on the ground now requested more assistance from the air force. They needed more strikes on enemy defensive positions, warehouses, and transport columns. \n\nThe Pacific Fleet VVS considered our task complete. There were few targets worth the trip that concerned the Navy, since most of the enemy had evacuated from the area, apparently unwilling to face our amphibious assault. So it was decided that our regiment would be moved up north and turned over to the 1st Red Banner Army. Two Il-10 squadrons of the 26nd ShAP would be transferred to Pogranichnyi airfield, and be at the disposal of the local commanders for the remainder of the war.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe move was surprisingly painless, and by the next day we already received our first orders. \n\nLate on the 11th of August our units had taken a key location on their drive to Mudanjiang, the city of Mulin. The Japanese defenders were retreating to Mudanjiang, along the only road in the area. The road was clogged with vehicles and troops. Virtually no flak, save for small arms. This was sturmovik heaven. \n\nYour Objective: take a zveno to Mulin and attack Japanese transport columns.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:40 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,400 meters. Your strike targets are marked on your maps. Your primary targets are enemy armored vehicles and trucks. \n\n
