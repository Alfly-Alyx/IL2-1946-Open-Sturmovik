Description \nHualing Junction\n\nDate: 12th of August, 1945\nTime: 14:30\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Pogranichniy\n\nAfter lunch we got the news. The gigantic amphibious assault was a success, and after a brief skirmish our troops were in control of Yuki and Rasin, our main targets from just two days ago. It was a jarring thought that now somebody would be getting medals for rebuilding the structures we just got the medals for destroying. Meanwhile, our units continued to advance towards the Korean peninsula, meeting virtually no resistance; at least, not the kind of resistance we were used to from the war with Germany.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAt 14:00 we received our next orders. 26th Infantry Corps, advancing on Mudanjiang from the north, was approaching another Japanese-held town, Hualing. Aerial reconnaissance reported a stronger-than-usual concentration of enemy vehicles and artillery in the area, and a string of cargo trains steaming into the railway station. We were scrambled to prevent the Japanese from digging in and putting up a challenge.\n\nYour Objective: destroy enemy cargo trains at Hualing.\n\t\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 14:30 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,400 meters. Your strike targets are marked on your maps. A zveno of Il-10s already in the air will deal with any flak. Your priority targets are enemy cargo trains at the Hualing railway junction.\n\n
