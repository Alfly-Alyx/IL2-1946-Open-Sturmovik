Description \nSlaughter\n\nDate: 21th of April, 1945\nTime: 16:00\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Sulechow\n\n1st Byelorussian and 1st Ukrainian Fronts continued to advance on Berlin despite fierce resistance. They continued to suffer record losses. Germans counter-attacks seemed to wind down after they lost Muenchenberg. Instead, the Wehrmacht pulled back to regroup along the Berlin's eastern outskirts, leaving Volkssturm anti-tank units along the way. While Katukov's and Bogdanov's tanks chewed through the defenders at Reichsstrasse 1, Chuikov's 8th army was ordered to turn south-west, cross the Spree, and enter Berlin from the south-west. \n\nEarly Saturday morning even the Il-2s did not fly due the downpour that kept visibility at less than 20 meters. Most of the regiments pilots stayed at the CP, smoking, and waiting for the weather. \n\nZiberov, the political officer, came by at around 11, his soggy overcoat dripping off a little shower at the doorstep. All of the pilots jumped up and saluted the Major.\n\n"Nice smoke screen you got going in here, falcons..." Ziberov removed his crusher cap and shook the water off. "At ease everyone, sit down."\n\nI moved a liberated armchair forward. "Why don't you sit down too, major. Forgive the smoke screen. We're all preparing for future sorties, studying battle maps, discussing prior missions, sharing experience..."\n\nOblivious to the smirks behind his back, Ziberov reclined in the chair, caressed the blue silk of the arm rest, then began rubbing off the cigarette burns on the cushion. \n\n"Very good, very good. I'm proud of you boys, of course I am. You're an exemplary squadron. Had to do something right to deserve such an honor from the Kremlin, to be the first to get the new sturmoviks. The government won't just trust anybody with that, right?"\n\nI nodded. Ziberov took out a silver cigarette case from his empty holster, flipped it open, and yanked it so just one cigarette popped up. He quickly glanced over at my empty hands, but then pretended to be busy looking for his lighter, and put the cigarette case away.\n\n"By the way," he said, "what day is it tomorrow?"\n\n"Of course we remember, sir!" I was afraid he'd look around and notice the puzzled looks on the faces of other pilots. "It's the April 22nd, the 75th birthday of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin!"\n\n"Very good Kozlovzev, very good. Take heed, everybody. Great political footing, no wonder he's the squadron commander... So, tomorrow, on this momentous day, the command of the 1st Ukrainian Front wants to offer a worthy present to the Soviet Government. Tomorrow, we'll assault the very lair of the fascist beast, the city of Berlin. Everyone is expected to nurture their righteous anger, and to mercilessly punish the hitlerites, without mercy..."\n\nZiberov lost his train of thought, so I seized the opportunity, stood at attention and saluted.\n\n"Crystal clear, sir! We'll make you proud! The fritzes will get no mercy from us, sir!"\n\n"Ah, very good, very good... They got some new portraits of Lenin and Stalin at the warehouse, and the red flags. Go up there, get your share, and decorate this place. Clean it a bit too, this place is a pigsty!"\n\nZiberov stretched, then got up and stuck out his hand for me to shake. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAfter the rain turned to light drizzle in the afternoon, I was called up to regiment to get my orders. By the time I was back at my CP, the rain stopped, and breaks began to appear in the clouds. I gathered three more pilots and briefed them as we walked to our IL-10s. The four of us were to strike retreating Wehrmacht units south of Fuerstenwalde.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10. \n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:00 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Bypassing Fuerstenwalde from the West, initiate an attack on enemy transport columns along the highway to Frankfurt-an-der-Oder. \n\n
