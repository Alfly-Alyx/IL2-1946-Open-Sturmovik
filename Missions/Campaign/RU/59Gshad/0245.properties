Description \nUneasy dawn\n\nDate: 16th of April, 1945\nTime: 05:45\nWeather: Fog\nLocation: Sulechow\n\nYesterday's mission was a good test of the new sturmovik's speed characteristics. At the same time, it uncovered a serious problem. The plane picked up speed much more rapidly in a dive than its predecessor, and that gave us less time to aim and fire. Of course, we knew this already from the passes we made at the test range; but there it didn't seem so bad, but over hostile territory, with flak bursts tracking you, our firing accuracy suffered greatly compared to the slower Il-2s. \n\nThe footage we brought back was not very good, mostly just a blur. The results of our attack could only be guessed at. However, our staff officer Major Spiridonov sent up a cheerful report of "up to twenty vehicles, ten half-tracks, and five Tiger tanks" confirmed destroyed.\n\nThe next day the front-line papers printed an article titled "New Sturmoviks have their way with Tigers". Now, the number of Tigers destroyed was ten, and the area around their burned-out hulls was "littered with bodies of hundreds of hitlerites". We chuckled at it quietly, exchanged some glances, but tried not to make any sweeping remarks in our discussion. The author of the article, one V. Pchelkin, got a few choice words. Of course, each of us saved a copy of the paper - one way or another, this was still recognition of our work. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAt the evening line-up, our political officer Ziberov read the latest dispatch from the Soviet Government to the front-line units. Afterwards everyone wandered off quietly. Few of us talked, knowing full well we all shared the same feeling. No one wanted to die right before the war's end.\n\nLater on, after dusk, squadron commanders got their orders for the 16th of April. Mine were to take off at the crack of dawn and provide direct support to the infantry units advancing in the Seelow Heights area.\n\nOur airfield was just 30 km from Oder, so most of us were awakened very early by the tremors and the horrific roar of artillery. You could feel the air vibrating in your chest, and the entire horizon lit up as if the sun was rising from the West. It begun Somewhere out there, right under the shrieking shells, our infantry men froze in their trenches, clutching their weapons, gathering their strength to jump out and run forward as soon as the barrage ceased. As always on days like these, I imagined myself sitting in a shuddering ditch, clumps of clay tumbling down into puddles of water at my feet, a PPSh in my hands. That it wasn't true, that I made it as a pilot instead and had a quiet bed to sleep in and a warm breakfast to wake up to, the luck was so incredible that it was almost embarrassing. This image was my biggest inspiration to fly and fight. If my shells and rockets could save the life of just one of those guys who wasn't so lucky, who did have to sit in a trench with a PPSh, then maybe there was a reason for me to sleep on clean sheets and eat real eggs.\n\nWe all began gathering at the CP with the barrage still going full strength. Most of us were quiet. Everyone had his own way of suppressing fear in face of such overwhelming ambiance.\n\nA mechanic came in, saluted, reported that the planes were ready. I saluted back, rattled off the standard response, and marched to my new crate. Propeller clean, tire pressure good, pitot tube cover removed, ailerons move fine, flaps OK, tailwheel free, elevator, rudder As I completed my walk-around, I stopped by the wing root, looked up, grabbed the muzzle of the 23mm cannon, and squeezed the steel until my knuckles were white. Somehow that always gave me strength before a mission. \n\nThe entire airfield was covered with fog, painted cherry pink by the new dawn. It didn't look like it was going to lift. We quickly altered our plans, deciding to fly to the objective in smaller groups.\n\nYour Objective: strike enemy defensive positions near Seelow Heights.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 05:45 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Ingress at 800-1,000 meters. In case of poor visibility descend to 500 meters. Your targets are located at the bottom of the Seelow Heights. Your primary target is static and self-propelled artillery.\n\n\n
