Description \nWest of Berlin\n\nDate: 25th of April, 1945\nTime: 17:00\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\nDuring our strike on Tempelhof two more of our planes were hit, leaving only two Il-10s in combat-ready state. Our second squadron at the same time had no airworthy planes left at all. In short, after just ten days of combat operations, we virtually ceased to exist. We did not lose many pilots; we just ran out of planes. \n\nThe only thing our two remaining Il-10s could do was operate over areas of secondary importance with little flak coverage. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nTo the West of Berlin the 47th Army of the 1st Byelorussian Front, and the 4th Tank Army of the 1st Ukrainian Front were fighting their way towards each other. Just a few kilometers of weak defensive lines stood between them, and it was clear to everyone that Berlin would be completely surrounded in a matter of hours. The enemy desperately tried to move supplies and reserve units into Berlin through this corridor while they had the chance. To prevent them from reaching positions within the city, we were ordered to patrol the airspace over the corridor, and to attack anything we saw. \n\nYour Objective: search and destroy enemy vehicles West of Berlin.\n\nYour Flight: 2 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:00 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Initiate your attack from the south. Your targets are located south-east of Faklensee, in the area designated on your maps. \n\n
