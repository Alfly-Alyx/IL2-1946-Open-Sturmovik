Description \nAnother War\n\nDate: 9th of August, 1945\nTime:10:10\nWeather: Fog\nLocation: Sukhaya Rechka\n\nFlying over the little village where I grew up was overwhelming. I knew every path, every brook, every clearing in the forest, every tree. Tiny and insignificant, they all passed under my wing. The entire universe of the first 18 years of my life was just a couple of kilometers across. \n\nI taxied the plane to the hangar, did a flamboyant tire-screeching about face, and shut off the engine. The mechanic tried to help me get out, but I stopped him with a smile. "Thanks, but I'm not wounded. I don't need help." Everyone saluted me as I marched to the regiment CP.\n\n"Comrade colonel, reporting in, sir. Aerial reconnaissance conducted as ordered."\n\n"Get on with it, Kozlovzev."\n\n"Six transport ships at Rasin. Looks like they're being loaded. Lots of fishing boats around them. At Yukin, didn't see any warships, just little civilian vessels. Rasin is defended by two flak batteries, mostly small-caliber. At the airfield between Yuki and Rasin, whatever it's called, up to ten single-engine planes and four large twin-engines, presumably transports."\n\n"Thank you, Captain. Just what we needed. Go get some rest, you and everybody else, just rest up the whole day and don't do nothing. Tomorrow... Tomorrow may be a hard day. That's all I'm going to say."\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAlarms startled everyone awake at exactly 6 in the morning. By 06:10 the regiment was lined up by the HQ. Our chief of staff made a speech. In order to assist our faithful allies United States and Great Britain, this morning the Zabaykal, 1st Far East and 2nd Far East Fronts began an offensive against the Kwantung Army in Manchuria. \n\nDuring the night our level bombers hit Rasin and set several ships and warehouses around the harbor on fire. At 09:30 we got orders to take our Il-10s to Rasin and strike any transport ships still intact. We planned the mission exactly as we trained: four Il-10s would fly ahead and suppress enemy AAA; and then two more zvenos would follow-up and strike the main target.\n\nWe would be escorted by more state-side Navy hot-shots, the Yak-9D's of the 14th IAP, Pacific Fleet.\n\nYour Objective: attack transport ships moored at Rasin.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-100.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:10 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters. Your strike targets are marked on your maps. Your zveno is to strike the single transport vessel in the center of the harbor. Vessels moored at the pier will be hit by the second zveno.\n\n
