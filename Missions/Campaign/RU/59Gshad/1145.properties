Description \nOver Berlin\n\nDate: 24th of April, 1945\nTime: 09:20\nWeather: Rain\nLocation: Fuerstenwalde\n\nEarly on the 22nd of April, we got unexpected orders to rebase. We would be moving up to Fuerstenwalde, the airfield we bombed just a few days before. Our new location would allow for more sorties, and quicker response time for targets within the city of Berlin. As usual, the move was a mess, nothing was organized, and for two days we could not fly at all, waiting for the supply trucks to arrive. Most of the pilots used the opportunity to get plenty of sleep.\n\nI was one of the first to land, and like all the others, I parked my plane quickly, jumped out and ran to check the nearby buildings for "trophies". My find became the envy of the entire squadron. In a nearby hangar I ran into a shiny new BMW motorcycle, without a scratch on it, and fully fueled to boot. I haven't been on a bike in four years, so of course I jumped right on and went for a ride.\n\nThe rural road leading away from the frontline was strangely empty, and after half an hour I must have covered 30 k, if not more. The forest receded and I ran into a deserted village. A few buildings on the outskirts were destroyed, and the roads and some fences were mangled by tanks, but mostly the place looked pristine. Here and there little numbers with arrows were pained on the walls, directions for delayed soldiers to find their units.\n\nAs I slowly drove through the empty streets, I suddenly decided to stop by a large house surrounded by a sea of blue flowers. I kept the BMW's engine idling, and grabbed my PPSh from the sidecar. I took the safety off and slowly approached the door. Three knocks. No answer.\n\nI yanked the door handle, and the door creaked open. The house was as clean inside as it was outside. A pink girl's coat still hung by the door. I checked the rest of the house, but there was no one there. The owners must have evacuated long ago. Finally, I went down to the basement, and immediately saw what I came there for: three rows of wooden barrels on a long rack. It was a shame I couldn't take them all. I whacked the cork on the nearest barrel with the butt of my PPSh, and dark red liquid came out. Such a waste! I didn't even have to taste it, the smell alone was enough. I grabbed the barrel next to it and, one after another, carried four more to the bike. I needed some rope to hold them together, and it even looked like I could take more, but I really needed to get going. I was AWOL, and I had to be back before anyone noticed. I just hoped I wouldn't be stopped on the way by some overzealous MP.\n\nRight outside the village I was flagged down by a passing Willys jeep. NKVD. My heart sank, but the Captain was an OK guy. I got my pardon in exchange for two barrels of wine. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nWe finally got our fuel and ammunition right after midnight on April the 24th, and by the morning we were finally able to fly combat. By now our units had taken the towns of Fuerstenwalde and Frankfurt-an-der-Oder, and enveloped the remains of Busse's IX Army. 1st Byelorussian Front with its 47th Army was circling Berlin from the north, and was only a few dozen kilometers from the tanks of the 1st Ukrainian Front advancing from the south. Chuikov's troops were assaulting the city from the South-East. The ring around Berlin was shrinking. \n\nAt 08:50 my squadron was given its next set of missions. For myself, I selected a seemingly non-glamorous request for a pair of Il-10s to neutralize German artillery on the East side of Berlin. This was our squadrons first, and so far the only mission over Berlin itself. I knew everyone envied me now even more.\n\nYour Flight: 2 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 2 x FAB-100 + 4 x BRS-132.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 09:20 heading North-East. The flight route is marked on your maps. Ingress at 500 meters. Your designated targets are shown on your map.\n\n
