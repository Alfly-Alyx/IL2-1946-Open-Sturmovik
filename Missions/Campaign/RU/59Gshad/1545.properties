Description \nCoastal Reconnaisance\n\nDate: 8th of August, 1945\nTime: 04:45\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Sukhaya Rechka\n\nThe mission to suppress Busse's breakout near Fuerstenwalde was the last my regiment flew over Germany. By the 27th of April the regiment existed only on paper. All of our aircraft were either lost in combat, or written off to other causes. However, both of our squadrons equipped with Il-10s did complete their main task, which was to evaluate the new sturmovik, to discover its strengths and weaknesses, and to compile an evaluation report and recommendations for future use.\n\nNot many of our pilots were happy with the situation. We withdrew from a crucial battle at a crucial point, and it looked like the war would be won without us. Of course, we understood the importance of our tasks. Evaluation of new aircraft was vital to the war effort. However, sitting at a desk and writing out battle reports in our best handwriting was not how we imagined our evaluation of the Il-10. We hoped to make an impact, to see our faces in the papers, to read articles praising our flying ability and our use of the new sturmovik. As it was, we stuck our nose in, and had the door slammed in our face. Between all the calligraphy, we listened to radio broadcasts, and hounded pilots from other regiments to give us updates on the state of the war. \n \nAdolf Hitler commited suicide on April 30th. Germany surrendered to Zhukov on May 9th. The next few days were a haze of drinking and celebrating. By the 12th our commanders finally started trying to get the regiment back together, and to get us to finish our reports. It was the strangest feeling. All that was left of that all-consuming war was a blank piece of paper in front of you; and when that paper was finished, you'd be on that long train home.\n\nMost of us were in complete shock over the thought of a post-war life. Most of our pilots enlisted straight out of high school, and the only job they ever had was flying and fighting. Many contemplated staying in the army, but of course the Soviet Union would not need such a large army in peacetime, and we knew most of us would be discharged. Some of the shrewder pilots used all their spare time to study military textbooks, and sent in applications to military academies. Others discussed stateside life to no end. How does one find a job? What jobs could one get with no experience and no education? Could they get into college at this age? Where would they live? Some of our pilots didn't even know where they would go. Their families, their houses, and often their entire villages and towns were wiped off the face of the Earth by four years of war. Other's families had been evacuated beyond the Urals in 41-42, and most haven't heard from them since. How would they find them in the post-war chaos?\n\nOur report was finally completed a week later, and it was sent up to Kremlin, to be read and signed by Stalin himself. The days after that dragged on in endless wait for discharge papers. Few of us didn't have a certain sense of dread. When a young staff officer came by and told me to report to regiment CP, I knew the time has come.\n\nInside I saw more generals than I had ever seen in my life. General Pyotr Zvonarev, chief of staff of the air army, startled me with a hug.\n\n"Sit down, Captain, very glad to see you! How's the squadron doing on this fine day?"\n\n"Thank you, sir." I grabbed a chair. "We're doing great...  Although things could be better."\n\n"How so?"\n\n"Some of us are overwhelmed. It's difficult to adapt to peacetime. Some of the pilots are still celebrating the victory day, if you know what I mean."\n\n"Yours isn't the only squadron I've visited." General winced. "Everyone needs some time to adjust. They're trying to think of a solution at the highest level. By the way, where are you from?"\n\n"Sir? Don't you have that in my file?"\n\n"A file's a file, but I want to hear it out of the horse's mouth."\n\nThe general had a strange spark in his eyes, and I wondered if I was in some kind of trouble.\n\n"I'm from the Vladivostok region, a little hunter's village near lake Khasan. Why?"\n\n"Ah, so a hunter from Primorsky Krai? Been hunting in the taiga much?"\n\n"Yes sir, me and my father used to go out hunting a lot. The only way to get meat where we lived. Very plentiful around there, game, fowl, berries and mushrooms too..."\n\n"You miss home? Where's the last time you been back?"\n\n"Whew, sir, I haven't been back since October 1937, when I joined the air force."\n\n"In that case I have great news for you."\n\nMy heart sank. The general got up and walked to the large map of USSR hanging on the wal.\n\n"Look here. This is where you're from. It's a pretty troubled region right now. Danger looming, as they say. The Japanese Kwantung Army is amassing on our borders. Over a million men. Our Government is worried that the Japanese aggressors are planning to attack the Soviet Union along the entire border, from the sea to lake Khanko. You know what that would mean."\n\n"Yes, sir." I was astonished. The Japanese wanted to attack us? Right after we beat their chief ally? I tried to gather my thoughts "Wouldn't be easy for them. It's just swamps and hills and little rivers everywhere. Not good for tanks, for artillery, and for sturmoviks too of course."\n\n"Yes, yes, you're right... Keep listening though."\n\nThe general sat back down. Other generals gathered behind his back. \n\n"VVS of the Pacific Fleet just formed a new Il-10 regiment. Plenty of good officers there, 10-15 years in the army, but none ever saw combat. So they're as green as they can be, maybe even worse, after flying over nothing but friendly territory for 15 years... You see what Im leading up to?"\n\nI nodded.\n\n"Attaboy. They need an veteran commanding them, somebody with combat experience and some medals on his chest, somebody who knows how to lead his men in battle... And, if I can be frank, those Navy jerks think they know everything, so they need a land-lubber to set them straight. You up for the job?"\n\nI swallowed hard, and began rubbing my forehead. Now that was some unexpected change... I took a deep breath.\n\n"Sir, that'd be wonderful. I've been dying of boredom out here."\n\n"Wonderful! I'm glad we have your agreement to go with these orders. I really am. Of course you get to go home and visit your family. Here you are, two weeks. And we'll think about getting you into the Academy. You're just the right type... Thank you, Captain. Finish up here at the regiment, pass the reigns, and go catch your train. Your two weeks leave just started."\n\n*****************************\n\nAs I expected, the Navy types at the new regiment didn't like me when I arrived. I could understand that. I immediately asked to fire up an Il-10, took off, and gave the scurvy dogs a little aerial demonstration. I doubt few of them had ever seen any plane, much less a sturmovik, do maneuvers like that. My masterpiece, a wheels-down loop on landing approach with touch-down at the lowest point, sealed the deal. The entire regiment in their unfamiliar blue uniforms gathered around my plane and applauded. The rest would be easy. Soon the entire regiment knew I flew over 500 sorties, personally destroyed hundreds of enemy targets, and instead of being shunned I was looked up to. All senior officers hung around me, trying to make friends. \n\nStill, there were difficult times ahead. I had to teach these pilots how to use their Il-10s in battle. We flew every day, early morning to late afternoon, and then studied in the classroom in the evening. I developed new-found respect for my comrades as well. Most of them were capable, experienced pilots, and many instinctively knew what I was about to teach them. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nBy late July I was seeing a lot of familiar faces around our airfield. The stories were all the same. People of lower ranks didn't get an invitation from a general. They just sat around in Germany waiting to go home, and then were packed into railroad cars, entire divisions at a time. As they passed through Germany, Eastern Europe, Belarus, Western Russia, past Moscow, past the Urals, the soldiers became increasingly more confused. Where were they going? Even most of the officers didn't know. Many weeks later, after crossing an entire continent, they were unloaded in Primorsky Krai, tired and confused. \n\nIt was clear something was going down, but what? We had a neutrality pact with Japan; surely we weren't going to attack first? Was our government worried that Japan would attack on their own? That seemed far-fetched. Japan was losing the war with America, and losing hard. The last thing they needed is another front and another powerful enemy. On July 27th we read the Potsdam Declaration from the Western Allies, calling for Japan to surrender. The end was near. We all hoped that common sense would prevail in Japan, and we would all get to go home.\n\nOn August 7th I was ordered to report to the regiment HQ and received unsettling orders. The next day we were to reconnoiter Japanese-held territory around the ports of Rasin and Yuki, and bring back details of the defensive structures there, and of any warships we saw. If we were reconnoitering enemy defenses, this could only mean one thing. We were preparing to attack.\n\nYour Objective: reconnoiter the designated area with a pair of Il-10s.\n\nYour Flight: 2 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 04:45 heading South-West.
