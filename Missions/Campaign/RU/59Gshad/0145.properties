Description \nThe Eve of Battle\n\nDate: 14th of April, 1945\nTime:\t07:45\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Sulechow\n\nYou could almost taste the victory in the air in the spring of 1945. There was heavy fighting all around us, even more brutal and desperate than I've even seen before, but it didn't feel the same. We were a part of a dagger inching its way towards the heart of the beast. The end was near. Everyone was filled with a strange vibrant elation, and even the deaths of comrades no longer enraged us like before. They just disappointed us, that those guys got so close to making it. \n\nI was recently appointed commander of the 1st squadron of the 59th Guards Sturmovik Air Regiment. Our regiment was the first, and so far the only one along the entire front to be equipped the new Ilyushin Il-10's. Only our 1st and 2nd squadrons received the new planes; the 3rd squadron still retained their trusty old Il-2s. We went through familiarization training back East, and in early April the regiment was ready for combat, and sent into the thick of it, right to Berlin.\n\nBy that time our infantry units advanced to positions along the Western banks of the Oder river. Preparations for the war's final offensive were fully under way. \n\nThrongs of men and equipment slowly moved up the roads to the Oder, and sat there waiting to flood Hitler's ultimate citadel. The weather was not entirely favorable however. All week it's been raining, sometimes even snowing, and the terrain along the entire region turned into gunk impassable for even tanks and halftracks. All of our traffic was concentrated into a few east-west autobahns in the area. The traffic jam was horrendous. Most of our regiment was stuck in those trucks for days, sitting out the rain and cursing at the traffic girls waving their little red flags everywhere with no discernable effect. When my truck got to the airfield we found that not a single mechanic from our regiment had yet arrived. The mechanics of a neighboring fighter squadron had to get a crash course and work triple shifts to maintain our Il-10s too. Everyone took this matter-of-factly after four years of war. \n\nOur mechanics and the rest of the regiment pulled up a few days later, and the next minute everyone forgot all about the episode. The four regiments based at the airfield, two sturmovik, one fighter, and one night bomber, were assigned three service regiments - quite a luxury by frontline standards.\n\nOn the 7th of April we finally flew our new sturmoviks in the combat zone. After a few final touch-and-gos around the field, we flew towards the front line, in small groups of four to six planes. The Luftwaffe almost ceased to exist by that point, so we were able to familiarize even the replacements with the tactics and the area of operations.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nIn the evening of the 13th of April I received orders to report to the CP.\n\nMajor Lukyanov, our CO, saluted me weakly and gestured to join him at the large table strewn with maps.\n\n"Sit down Kozlovzev, make yourself at home. Just don't forget you're at a CP." He smiled and unfolded a map, turned it around so I could see it better. "How are the new planes, how are the boys feeling about them?"\n\n"Everyone says it's a good plane, sir. Mechanics are happy, it's much easier to deal with than the old Il, you can reach anything with a wrench without taking it apart. The planes are made well, all flyable just as they were made at the factory. The only problem is, the engine rods come off. The mechanics have no idea what's going on, seems to happen randomly."\n\n"Pfft..." Lukyanov raised an eyebrow. "Not good. Not good at all. We're breaking through to Berlin, the worst kind of slaughter is about to hit, and the entire front's got faulty engine rods?"\n\n"Let's hope that gets solved before the offensive starts."\n\n"Well, you keep on hoping, and I'll report this up to the division. I'll call Ilyushin himself down here, God damn it, let him get a wrench and fix it! Write all this on your acceptance reports, straight by the book. Check the engines on the ground, test it at different RPM, test Well, you know all this, you've been around the block a few times. You know what I'm saying."\n\nI nodded.\n\n"Now let's talk business." Lukyanov looked up at me. "Guess who's going into combat tomorrow morning. They want to test out the new Sturmovik's combat capabilities."\n\nThe CO picked up a pen and pointed at the area West of Sulechow. \n\n"Look here. Here's the Oder river. Here's Frankfurt-an-der-Oder. Over there we're still not holding the other bank. Mark it on your map, in case you have to ditch somewhere you don't ditch your brand new toy right into the enemy's hands. So, air recon photographed that area five or six times, but they're not requesting hourly updates on enemy troop movements." Lukyanov rolled his eyes ever so slightly. "So tomorrow morning take up a section, and get yourselves over the front line over there. See what's going on, make a note of it. If you see something big, feel free."\n\nIn the morning I gathered the pilots at our squadron CP. I picked out the three I felt most comfortable with, took them aside and briefed them on the details of our mission. Everyone listened quietly. They opened their map cases, sketched out the known enemy flak positions, wrote down the times and the frequencies. We discussed it for a while and then agreed on the best ingress route. We'd think of a way back once we got there.\n\nYour Objective: conduct armed reconnaissance over the frontlines in the Frankfurt-an-der-Oder area.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 x RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:45 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Proceed to Oder at tree-top height. After crossing the river climb to 800 meters, and observe enemy troop movements along the roads. Make a note of the cargo types as well. Specifically pay attention to the roads north-west of the city. \n\nYou are free to engage any targets along your route.\n\nYou will be escorted by a pair of Yak-9Ms. However, the fighters won't stick around for most of your flight over the enemy territory. In case of trouble, use the Il-10s improved high speed to pull back to friendly territory.\n\nNote: In the Customization screen, please select the following camo scheme: Brown-Green.\n\n
