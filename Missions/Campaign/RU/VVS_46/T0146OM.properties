Description The First Flight\n\t\nIn early 1945 the State Defense Committee and the Central Committee of the Communist Party made the decision to rearm and refit the Soviet armed forces, and to create new units and divisions. All available resources were dedicated to this task. The Soviet Army, Navy and Air Force began receiving new weapon prototypes. Emergency mobilization, and a series of amnesties, raised nearly fifty new divisions. The Soviet Union was preparing to face a new imminent threat. \n\nBy the end of the year VVS received their first jet-powered fighters, the LaGG-3RD and the Yak-15. They slowly began to replace the piston-engine fighters. By January of 1946 another fighter, the MiG-9, went into serial production, and Soviet long-range bomber regiments began receiving fearsome new weapons. USAAF' s old Boeing B-29s from the Pacific were sent to Russia through the lend-lease programme, and the Soviet Union began producing their own unlicensed version, the Tupolev Tu-4. The designers from the aviation design bureaus responsible for these new planes were awarded large prizes by Stalin. However the air force units still had a long way to go to get used to their new planes.\n\nDate: 16th of April, 1946\n          1030\nWeather: Hazy \nLocation: Kostino\n\nTwo months after signing of the peace treaty I was transferred to the reorganized 183rd Fighter Regiment of the 294th Air Division. I was promoted to the commander of the 2nd squadron. With my impressive war record I quickly gained the trust and respect of my new squad mates, most of them 18 to 20 years old, kids straight out of flight school. The Soviet VVS, now free of battle attrition, was growing at an exponential rate.\n\nThe first year of peace, 1945, was almost as busy for us as the times of war. We trained and flew constantly. Bad harvest, mobilization, and transportation shortage led to wide-spread famine that affected everyone, but especially so the east White Russia, and left bank of the Ukraine. As front line pilots we got more and better supplies than the people around us. Those of us with families in the worst affected regions tried to send anything we could out there, despite the censors and occasional reprimands from the political officers. \n\nIn early February of 1946 our entire regiment was sent up to Kursk, to the recently opened training center for fighter pilots at Ponyri. We and another regiment (261st) flew in with our Yak-3s, and were to be retrained and refitted with Yak-15s; other regiments that flew in with their La-5s were given LaGG-3RDs. Both the Yak-15 and the LaGG-3RD were considered temporary training planes, given to us to ease the transition to jets. After mastering these we would be converted to the more complex, and more promising MiG-9.\n\nBy mid-April we were finally done with the classroom, and the regiment was allowed to take the jets for the first few flights. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nRegiment and squadron commanders are to be the first to fly the new planes, to be followed by flight leaders, and then the rest of the pilots. Seeing the more experienced pilots fly successfully will give more confidence to the younger ones. \nConsidering the similarities in handling and operations between the Yak-15 and the Yak-3, the familiarization training is expected to be completed quickly. The engines of the new Yak-15s officially have 25 hours of endurance, but in reality no more than 17; so the regiment is expected to become familiar with the plane in less than 15 hours of flying, to allow us to fly the aircraft back to our assigned airfield without requiring engine maintenance.\n\nYour Objective:\t\n\nTake the Yak-15 for your first familiarization flight. You will be followed by your two flight leaders. Be aware of other pilots conducting training flights in the vicinity. \n\nYour Flight: 1 x Yak-15\n\nLoadout: empty.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 1030 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,500 meters, and airspeed of 500 km/h; your never-exceed airspeed is 700 km/h.\n\nAttention: in the Loadout screen please select the RRG_Gray-Gray.bmp paintscheme for your aircraft.\n\n
