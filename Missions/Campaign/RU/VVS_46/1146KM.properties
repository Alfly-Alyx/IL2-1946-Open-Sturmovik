Description Free Hunt\n\nOnly a pair of MiG-9s came to our help, but even that was enough. For the first time in the new war, I was on the winning side of the air battle, and for the first time in my career I felt the satisfaction of flying a fighter superior to the enemy. The new German fighter failed to impress; it seemed even weaker than the jets I've encountered before. \n\nIt was becoming clear that a new offensive was being prepared. We kept seeing endless streams of pontoon boats and supply trucks move past our airfield. Joseph Stalin spoke to the nation on August 31st, and promised that the great city of Kiev would be retaken before the 29th Anniversary of the Great Communist Revolution on November 7th. This was a promise not to be broken. Each commander understood that if he was in any way responsible for Stalin's promise being broken, the consequences would be dire. And this meant that huge number of soldiers would again be sacrificed to reach this superficial goal. Georgiy Zhukov's appointment to command the overall operation made us aware of that even more. Our lives now mattered even less.\n\nDate: 1th of September, 1946\n          1520\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Borispol\n\nMission Briefing: \n\nIntel reports large number of enemy transport planes in the Obukhov  Belaya Tzerkov sector. Division HQ dedicated several pairs of experienced pilots to conduct search-and-destroy missions in the airspace of the sector. Their priority targets are transport planes, especially those heading towards the front lines, and assumed to be full. \nAdditional patrols are dedicated to the area of the front line, so in case of encountering serious opposition the hunters can retreat and request their help.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nPatrol the Obukhov  Brevnov  Belaya Tzerkov  Vasilkov quadrant. Look for enemy transport planes. You are not to enter the Kiev air defense sector, or to approach the Kiev airfield.\n\nYour Flight: 2 x MiG-9FS\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 1520 heading south-west. The flight route is marked on your maps. Cross the front line at minimum altitude to avoid detection.\n\n
