Description MiGs in der Luft!\n\nOn July 1st of 1946 German units broke through the Russian encirclement and relieved parts of the IV Army caught in the Korsun pocket. The linked-up Germans counter-attacked and managed to, in turn, encircle 14 divisions of the 3rd Ukrainian Front that had been attacking towards Belaya Tzerkov. The attempts to break through the German encirclement grew into a giant battle that went on non-stop for over two weeks, ending on July 16th. The entire 3rd Ukrainian Front collapsed as the result, suffering 180,000 casualties, and over 150,000 POWs. The situation was only stabilized by August 8th, when second echelon moved up and reinforced the 3rd Ukrainian's positions.\n\nGeorgiy Zhukov, who on the 5th of July took command of the 2nd Ukrainian Front, led a more successful offensive in the Borispol direction. By August 13th he broke through all German defenses, and took the towns of Borispol, Rogozov and Gogolev. The front line was mostly stabilized in the region, with both sides falling back to local skirmishes. The Red Army had no strength left to advance onto Kiev. The operation cost us 270,000 dead and wounded, 1,400 tanks and SPA, and over 800 aircraft. The official estimates of the German casualties were only 300,000 casualties and 2,000 tanks, and that number was unlikely to mean that the propaganda machine was suddenly becoming honest.\n\nDate: 29th of August, 1946\n          1745\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Borispol\n\nThe regiment arrived at Borispol on August 22nd, and was again attached to the battered 294th Air Division. The 183rd's new commander was a Colonel V.G. Lapskiy, fresh from the Baltic front. I was made the commander of the 1st squadron, with all my old 2nd squadron pilots moved up with me; the new 2nd squadron was commanded by Kapitan Silaev, who proved very capable during our fighting in July. By August 29th we've received and assembled all our MiGs, and were finally ready to go back to battle. \n\nMission Briefing:\nEight MiG-9s of the 516th IAP are covering retreating Il-10s, and they have been engaged by a large number of enemy fighters over the town of Obukov. We are receiving reports of a brand new fighter type used by the Germans. More MiG-9s are requested to take off and to assist the pilots of the 516th. The enemy is likely to also pull fresh forces into the fight, so be on your guard at all times.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nUrgently assist our MiGs fighting over enemy territory, near the town of Obukov. You case of problems two more zvenos of MiG-9s will be scrambled.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x MiG-9FS\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 1745 heading south-west. The flight route is marked on your maps. Try to climb to at least 3,000 meters, and keep your airspeed as high as possible.\n\nAttention: in the Loadout screen please select the RRG_Brown-Green 2.bmp paintscheme for your aircraft.\n\n
