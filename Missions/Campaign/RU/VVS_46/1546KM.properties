Description Wasp Nest\n\nBy the afternoon the larger bridgeheads were deemed secure, but late at night two German armored divisions ran the Soviet advance units back towards the river. Intense fighting followed, and only by September 18th were our units able to move to link up with other divisions advancing towards Kiev. Encirclement now seemed within reach. \n\nWe flew one uneventful patrol over the bridgehead. This was the first river crossing I've seen, and the sight was more sickening than anything I've seen in all my years at the front. A literal pile of bodies stretched endlessly across the area and disappeared into the river, the water turned pink by the blood. Burned out hulls of tanks and trucks sank into the dead, with waves of bodies seemingly running up to many of them. \n\nAfter landing, we've listened to a glowing Stavka report on the radio, boasting about the newly established bridgeheads. \n\nDate: 18th of September, 1946\n          1450\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Borispol\n\nThe Kiev airfield kept troubling our commanders. This was one of the few airfields in the area with concrete runways, from which the newer German aircraft could operate; and the airfield was close enough to the front to allow for rapid precise response to any of our actions. Incredibly thick flak covered all routes to the airfield, and night bombings were generally ineffective. \n\nHowever unexpected heroism on the 18th of September finally presented us with an opportunity.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAn apparent navigation error led 18 sturmoviks of the 166th GvSHAP into the Kiev airfield flak field. Realizing the mistake, but encountering very weak resistance, the squadron commander Major Barannikov made a momentous decision to exploit the opportunity. They flew straight for the field. There were no German fighters in the air. The sturmoviks struck flak positions across the wide area, and also managed to set several hangars and fuel tanks on fire. Most of the sturmoviks, including that of Major Barannikov, were lost over the target, but a few returned to report the gap in German defenses. \n\nYour Objective:\n\nTake off immediately with all available planes, and fly towards the Kiev airfield. Prevent any fighters from taking off. Sturmoviks are to follow, with a fighter screen to relieve you.\n\nYour Flight: 7 x MiG-9FS\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake off immediately, heading West. Penetrate into the airfield airspace from the South. \n\n
