Description New Threat\n\nDate: 9th of September, 1946\n          1620\nWeather: Hazy \nLocation: Borispol\n\nThe offensive is already behind schedule, and the problems continue to pile up. On the 7th of September the transport junction of crucial importance at Pereyaslav was targeted by a strike of incredible intensity, and was on fire for two days. All of the stockpiles of fuel and ammunition were lost, and railway and highway traffic was paralyzed. The losses among troops and civilian population cannot even be estimated.\n\nThe intel believes that the strike was conducted using the German V-1 rocket. They are believed to be launched from Fastov, where our pilots had previously reported strange contraptions on the ground. Their reports were finally heeded after the strike on Pereyaslav, and they are attempting to prevent more rockets from being launched. During the night some Tu-4s bombed the supposed location of the rockets, and during the day a conventional sturmovik force is sent to finish the job. The Sturmoviks would need a strong fighter cover. The strike area is in the direct vicinity of the Kiev airfield, and the Germans can be expected to mount very strong resistance. The sturmoviks must get through. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nFinally learning the lesson after evaluating the score of previous sturmovik strikes, the HQ designed the mission to proceed in three stages. In the first stage, two Il-10 regiments covered by 60 MiG-9 and Yak-15 fighters will attack any flak guns in the area while drawing in any enemy fighters. For the second stage, two groups of Sturmoviks attacking from multiple directions will strike the rocket installations directly. The third stage of the strike will clean up any remaining survivors, and also attack any targets of opportunity on the ground. \n\nYour Objective:\n\nTake part in the second wave of the attack. Cover 36 Il-10s with three zvenos of MiGs, and escort them on their strike mission. Your group of two zvenos is tasked with immediate protection; a zveno from the 1st squadron will fly top cover.\nIn case of light air opposition you are allowed to attack ground targets of opportunity. \n\nYour Flight: 8 x MiG-9FS\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake off and follow the Sturmoviks that will fly over your airfield, heading south-west. The flight route is marked on your maps. \n\n
