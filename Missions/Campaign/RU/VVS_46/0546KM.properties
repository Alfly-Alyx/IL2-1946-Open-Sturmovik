Description Learning the Hard Way\n\nDate: 22th of June1946\n          1020\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Peschanov\n\nThe first sorties of the new war were disastrous for us. The Germans were much better organized than we expected. They knew exactly where we were and where we were going, and they took up enough planes to meet us and turn us back. The 654th got it the worst. 14 planes took off, and not a single one returned. They were the first to be bounced by the Germans over Preyaslav, and they took the brunt of the assault. At least the Sturmoviks got through to their target. I didn't see them make an organized attack, they simply dropped their bombs on the city, turned around, and made their escape at full throttle. \n\nOther regiments also suffered catastrophic losses, and few completed their objectives. Planes working with the 1st Ukrainian Front were unable to get through to the German airfields, and they also suffered crippling losses. \n\nThings were a bit better off on the ground. I saw a giant tank column streaming into Pereyaslav, and the battle raged on the western outskirts of town, the defenders virtually pushed out into the fields. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe bridges over Dnepr we control are targets of vital importance. The Germans will without a doubt attempt to bomb the bridges. They are not yet defended by flak, and we cannot afford to assign permanent fighter cover to the airspace above them. Therefore we are relying on early warning radar to defend them. A few minutes ago our radar reported a German formation heading towards Pereyaslav, and the bridge is their most likely target. Eight Yak-15s of the 261st IAP are already over the city, and we are being scrambled to join them in the imminent battle. \n\nYour Objective:\n\nSupport the fighters of the 261st IAP. Intercept German aircraft heading towards Preyaslav. According to intel, German AAA is completely destroyed by our Sturmoviks, so you should not be afraid to get down low. Do not forget to watch your fuel; at these distances you have no more than 10-15 minutes worth of combat. \n\nYour Flight: 6 x Yak-15. \n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 1020 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. \n\n
