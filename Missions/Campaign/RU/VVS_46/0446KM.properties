Description The Beginning\n\nEarly on June 22nd the next stage of the Great Patriotic War begun. Soviet units, without a formal declaration of war, crossed into the rightfully Soviet territory occupied by Germany. Along the huge frontline stretching from the Baltic to the Black sea 11 fronts went onto the offensive, with forwards units comprising 98 infantry, 15 cavalry, and 57 armored and mechanized divisions, and supported by 46 artillery regiments, 7 parachute corps, and 53 aviation divisions. Early morning artillery barrage and air strikes are aiming to destroy the enemy's capacity to mount organized resistance.\n\nIn the Kiev region, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts are crossing into German-occupied territory in order to destroy the Borispol and Korsun strongholds, and prepare for the retaking of the city of Kiev.\n\nDate: 22th of June1946\n          0345\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Peschanov\n\nThe move completed without much trouble, and by around midnight the rain stopped, so the ground crews were able to work on the planes with less difficulty. The pilots barely got to get into beds, when at 2 am we were awakened by the rumble of artillery and the engines of seemingly endless streams of Li-2s carrying paratroopers overhead.\n\nIt has begun!\n\nNo one touched their breakfasts. Some of the younger pilots were visibly shaking. I tried to calm my squadron down before the flight, but I could barely hide my own nervousness. I couldn't suppress the thought that I was seeing at least one of these guys for the last time. \n\nThe entire regiment was lined up next to the airstrip. They brought out the regiment banner, and Major General Sleptzov bellowed out a speech, his voice cracking in the dawn moisture.\n\nComrades! The motherland and the Party have given you the highest honor by making you the very tip of the merciless sword with which we will strike the German occupant. Your division will cover our bombers and sturmoviks on one of the most difficult sectors of the offensive. And thus, the Soviet people and the Stavka have placed immense trust on you. You are given the newest fighters, the best in the world. But remember: the enemy is still strong, and cunning as ever! It'll take all your strength, all your will to achieve the ultimate victory. Do not let us down. For Motherland! For Stalin!\n\n\nThe squadron gave off a triple hurrah and saluted the banner. Morning mist crept up to our feet and was making us even more miserable. The general left and we wandered off towards our planes. Flight leaders gathered around Inshukov, our regiment CO, and received our final orders.\n\nAs we were getting strapped in, we saw the Li-2s return from their drops. There were much fewer of them this time, and they flew in a disorganized gaggle. Many of the planes trailed smoke. Some of the engines sneezed and whined. I wanted to curl up into a ball and crawl away. What was waiting for me there, beyond the Dnepr?\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nBy 0245 our paratroopers of the 386th and 411th Paratrooper Regiments managed to take hold of the bridges in Kanev and Pereyaslav-Hmelnitzki, and now they were holding off German counterattacks. German resistance was still sporadic. \nAt the moment, forward units of the 40th Guards Tank Army, and the 30th and 182nd Infantry Divisions were entering Pereyaslav to reinforce the bridgehead. The 403rd Sturmovik and 166th Guards Sturmovik Regiments are dedicated to supporting them. They have a double task: to prevent the enemy from retreating from the city into the next line of defense; and to prevent new units from entering the city to reinforce the defenders. \nOur division is to protect the Sturmoviks from any German air attack. \n\nYour Objective:\n\nSix Sturmoviks of the 108th GvShAP are conducting a search-and-destroy mission along the Borispol highway. Enemy opposition in the air is to be expected. Protect the Sturmoviks.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x Yak-15.\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off heading North-West, and follow the Sturmoviks which will pass directly over your airfields. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of at least 3,000 meters, and airspeed of 550 km/h.\n\n
