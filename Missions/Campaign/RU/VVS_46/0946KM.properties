Description The Death of the Regiment\n\nI was very glad, even surprised, that night landings went without a hitch. For most of the pilots this was their first. After landing we dragged our planes away from the airstrip, and spent half the night gathering tree branches to camouflage them. We picked old German barracks to stay in. Our field kitchen was nowhere in sight, probably requisitioned by some passing infantry. We sent another request for one, and had some cold lend-lease Spam out of old cans.\n\nIn the morning we went around looking for abandoned German planes. We didn't find anything we haven't seen before, just the boring old prop planes. And then I received the report from the lead mechanic, which made me even more depressed. Most of the Yaks were approaching their endurance limit, and we didn't have a single spare. This could spell trouble for me personally. Even though the matters of supply were completely out of my hands, I would be held personally responsible if the squadron would stop flying. \n\nDate: 29th of June1946\n          1130\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Subalu\n\nLooks like we were forgotten! We didn't receive any orders in two days, and we couldn't reach anybody who would care. I just hoped the people at HQ weren't having communications problems; after all, if they did, they could have sent a staff plane over to Subalu to check on us. We just sat on the ground, and watch formations of planes pass overhead in one direction, and then the other. The battles looked to be heavy; most of the formations we saw were much smaller when they returned. Even the outgoing formations seemed to be getting smaller day by day.\n\nBy the morning of the 29th we finally got a package by motorcycle messenger. Six planes were ordered to patrol over Preyaslav. No further details were included. This was strange, considering the reason why we were moved up to this little grass strip. \n\nAs we were getting into the cockpits and I prepared to take off, suddenly an air raid siren began blaring, and the airfield began to rumble. Hungry black shadows passed over us, towards Peschanov. They missed them! Early warning radar and ground observers must have been blind!\n\nYour Objective:\n\nTurn back towards Peschanov and do anything you can to disrupt the German attack.\n\nYour Flight: 6 x Yak-15\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nScramble heading South-East towards Peschanov. Maintain top airspeed. \n\n
