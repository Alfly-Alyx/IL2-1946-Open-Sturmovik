Description Trespasser\n\nDate: 21th of June1946\n          1730\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Zolotonosha \n\nEverything went without a hitch. The 2nd squadron managed to return home without being bothered by German fighters, even though the radar station reported a flight heading straight for us from the other side. The German side of the border looked peaceful, with no movement observed at all. Our territory looked similar; although at least in our case I knew the appearances were deceiving. At night we heard incessant rumble of engines and squeaking of tank threads. Giant armed formations moved towards the border and disappeared under the lush canopies of Ukrainian forests. Were these precautionary measures? We couldnt even guess. No one dared ask any questions. Special officers watched the squadron closely. We all knew that if there was something big being planned, wed know soon enough.\n\nOur airfield was overfilled. It housed two fighter and three sturmovik regiments. We were short of living quarters and hangars, blast pens, parking areas and all suitable spots under the nearby trees were taken. No one cared for secrecy any more. Two giant rows of Il-10s were parked wingtip to wingtip. New planes continued to arrive. The few veterans of the German attack in '41 continued to get that queasy feeling. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nEvery other day at 1730 was my time to sit in a cockpit on the ground for either hours, waiting for scramble orders. For the first couple of hours, while there was daylight, I could read books, but as it got dark I had to struggle not to fall asleep. \n\nBut today, the red scramble rocket bored into the sky just as I was strapping in. The mechanics got startled and scrambled to start my engine. I began to taxi for take-off, while they fiddled with my wingman's plane. The radio came to life, and I recognized the voice of major Sobkunin in the tower.\n\nZero-first, listen up. You're ordered to take-off immediately and proceed to Subalu. A single enemy plane just broke into our airspace. It's moving towards Peschanov airfield from the north-west at around 400 km / h. Scare it off or force it to land. Do not shoot it down. And watch out for provocations; it may merely be a decoy. But your main objective is to prevent that plane from flying over our airfields.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nIntercept and prevent the German plane from flying over our airfields. \n\nYour Flight: 1 x Yak-15\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nScramble heading North-West, proceed towards Subalu. Maintain altitude of 5,000 meters, and stay at or near your top airspeed.\n\n
