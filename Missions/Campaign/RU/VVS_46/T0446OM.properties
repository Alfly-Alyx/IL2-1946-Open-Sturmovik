Description The Intercept\n\nDate: 14th of August, 1946\n          1000\nWeather: Hazy \nLocation: Kostino\n\nUnlike a few fresh kids, I had no problem with the nose wheel; on the contrary, I was amazed by the improvements in ground visibility, especially compared to the lowriding Yak-15. Two days later the entire squadron was soloing in the MiG-9. The process went surprisingly well, especially considering that for many of our pilots these were their first solo flights in any plane. In general, we were stringing along much better than with the Yak-15s.\n\nEach pilot had four solo flights, and at least six or seven landings. We were not scheduled for any armament tests. It was deemed sufficient for us to learn to shoot right at the front. We heard excellent reports of the MiG performance in battle. Finally the VVS had a plane that could match and beat the German jets. I wished however to be able to talk to the pilots who actually used these planes in battle. What were their tactics? How did we fare against the Germans in all areas of performance? We weren't told; this sort of information was not gathered or compiled by anyone. It was up to each regiment to learn for themselves. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe final sortie for us is a squadron scramble and mock intercept of a bomber formation. Tu-4s from Bryansk will serve as out targets. Bomber gunners will use this mission to train as well.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nScramble the squadron and intercept the bomber formation. Conduct firing passes from the bomber's rear quarter. \n\nYour Flight: 12 x MiG-9FS\n\nLoadout: none; gun-camera only.\n\t\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 1000 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 4,000 meters, and airspeed of 600 km/h.\n\n
