Description King Cobra\n\nOur entire regiment was destroyed in a single raid. Most of the pilots perished with their planes, as the Germans caught them in their cockpits, getting ready to take off. Most of those who survived were in no condition to fight.\n\nDivision commander Sleptzov and most of his staff were court-martialed in the afternoon, and shot right outside the division headquarters. All of us heard the dry cracks of the pistol. Then the NKVD units turned their attention to us. Myself and other higher-ranking officers were all arrested, and questioned non-stop for over a week. I was one of the first ones released, and not even reprimanded. The move to Subalu turned out to have been very lucky. Some other squad leaders were not as fortunate. Some of the mechanics were sent to the camps as well, when the investigators got wind of our maintenance problems. Commanders of the flak and radar units along the path of the German formation suffered similar fates. \n\nAfter a few days, a decision was made to reform the regiment, and to send it back to the rear to refit and retrain. \n\nDate: 11th of August, 1946\n          1520\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kostino\n\nIn late July of 1946 the new 183rd IAP, mostly made up of new pilots, was again at the Ponyri training center. We were being converted to the MiG-9! Classroom studies took less than a month, and we had even less than that for training flights. The conditions at the front were worsening, and they needed us there. \nOn August 9th we took our first flight; and it was quite unusual.\n\nMission Briefing:\nPrevious training classes uncovered a completely unexpected problem. The pilots weren't used to planes with nose-wheels, and a few precious MiG-9s were damaged in taxiing accidents, and two were lost to tail strikes on landing. So the training program was updated, and a bunch of aging lend-lease P-63 Kingcobras were sent up to the airfield. A few captured Me-262s were also used for a while, but by the time we got to flying, the Messerschmitts were all broken down, and the top brass did not want to provide us with spare engines. \n\nWe were given two days to get used to planes with nosewheels.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nTake-off, circle the airfield, and perform a touch-and-go; after which perform another go-around, and a full landing. In case of problems you are allowed to do another touch-and-go.\nBe aware of other training flights in the vicinity.\n\nYour Flight: 1 P-63C-5\n\nLoadout: empty.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 1520 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. \n\n
