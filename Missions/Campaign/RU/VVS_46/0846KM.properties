Description Ambush\n\nThe planes that hit us as we tried to intercept that recce carried a familiar emblem. The 52nd Jagdgeschwader. I met those bastards in April of 44. The thought made me clench my fists. I hoped I'd make them recognize me.\n\nThe rain came on the evening of the 23rd, and the visibility fell to almost zero. We remained grounded for almost three days, unable to help our troops. The 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian Fronts were not doing very well. They did surround a German battle group between Kanev and Korsun, but the main thrust was not proceeding well. German fortifications at Borispol seemed impenetrable. Germans mounted multiple counter-attacks in multiple directions. It was rumored that the 3rd Tank Army which was spearheading the main thrust simply ceased to exist. \n\nDate: 26th of June1946\n          2030\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Peschanov\n\nAs the weather began to clear up, the HQ made emergency plans to rebase one squadron forward, to the Subalu airfield that's been taken back on the 22nd. This would place our planes along the common German routes into our rear, and surprise their bombers on the way to our airfields and supply lines. \nAs my squadron, the 2nd, was the least affected by the fighting, it was selected for the move.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nRebase to the forward airfield at Subalu. Maintain low altitude and utmost caution during the flight. Supplies and ground crews are already being moved forward in trucks. Upon landing, take utmost care to camouflage your presence. \n\nYour Objective:\n\nCovertly fly over to Subalu. You will be landing on an unlighted strip in low light conditions. Be careful. \n\nYour Flight: 8 x Yak-15\n\nLoadout: standard. \n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 2030 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 250 meters, and airspeed of 400 km/h. \n\n
