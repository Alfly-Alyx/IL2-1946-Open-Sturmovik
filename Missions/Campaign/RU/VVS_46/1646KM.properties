Description The Ring\n\nAfter the destruction of the Kiev airfield the German air defenses began to crumble. He-162s and Ta-153s, the only German planes capable of operating from grass strips, could do little to stop the armadas of Soviet jets. Zhukovs tank armies pulled up to the city, and the Germans began retreating from the city. They knew the city was lost, and with Hitler out of the picture, they saw no reason to hold it. Huge streams of trucks and horse-drawn carts appeared on the roads leading deeper into the German territory. Many of the people retreating were civilians, but the Soviet high command considered anyone retreating towards the German rear to be a traitor, so the sturmoviks were told not to worry. \n\nThe Kiev garrison continued to hold off the Soviet assault, covering the way for the retreat. The first ham-fisted attempt to storm the city led to almost two hundred tanks lost in the Kiev streets. The next wave pushed them aside, with screams of the crewmen still sounding from some burning tanks. Zhukov continued to send fresh troops into the battle with only the final goal in mind. His reserves were virtually endless. \n\nDate: 20th of September, 1946\n          1220\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Borispol\n\nAfter a month of fighting, only nine airworthy MiGs remained in our regiment, out of 28 weve had when we arrived. Not all were lost in combat, but we had no spare parts left to repair several more planes parked around the field. Situation was similar with other regiments. After liberation of Kiev the entire division was rumored to be schedule to be sent back to the rear to refit. \n\nMission Briefing:  \n\nThe Germans occasionally continue to strike our supply columns, operating from the Gostomel airfield. We are yet unable to suppress the airfield, as most of the resources continue to fly in support of the Kiev operation. 294th IAD is assigned the job of defending the Kiev airspace from any more intrusions. \n\nYour Objective:\n\nTake a zveno of MiGs to the airspace west of Kiev. You will be relieved by a zveno from the 2nd squadron. You are to stay in your assigned sector until their arrival. \nYour likely opposition will be older piston-engine types, including transport or staff planes attempting to flee the city.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x MiG-9FS\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 1220 heading west. The flight route is marked on your maps. Patrol altitude is between 1,500 and 2,000 meters.\n\n
