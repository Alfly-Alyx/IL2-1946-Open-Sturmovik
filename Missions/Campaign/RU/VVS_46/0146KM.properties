Description Along the Zolotonosha Trail\n\nDate: 20th of June1946\n          0900\nWeather: Hazy \nLocation: Zolotonosha \n\nCrates with brand new Yaks arrived only on June 10th. The pilots used the delay to get some rest, decorate their bunks, and study the area maps. Once the crates arrived, the mechanics worked through the night to put them together; the first planes were available to fly by the next morning. \n\nThe troubling thing was that each crate contained only enough parts to build a single plane. We got no spare parts or spare engines at all. Lead mechanic Stepin was outraged. He couldn't get anyone on the phone, so he ended up sending a telegram, and a letter to follow. By the time anyone would respond to the letter and send new parts, the entire regiment could again be grounded, from nothing but routine flights. He had no choice but to leave some aircraft in their crates, as temporary spare parts.\n\nMyself and a few other veterans gathered at the squadron CP every night and discussed the situation. The similarities to 1941 were uncanny. Just like back then, we were in the middle of refitting with brand new plane types, and were hopelessly short of airframes and of experience. The entire Southern region had exactly 350 new jet planes  not nearly enough to cover our area, and that's not to mention the fact that these Yaks and LaGGs were inferior to the planes flown by the Germans. At least the bomber regiments fared better; their new armored Il-10s and giant Tu-4s looked much better in comparison. The Germans still had nothing comparable. \n\nBy the 18th of June entire three squadrons of the 183rd were ready to fly, with 36 shiny Yaks lined up on the flight line. The 261st, also stationed at our airfield, was lagging behind, and their CO Colonel Krikunov could likely be arrested or at least reprimanded. If this wasn't peacetime, he might even have been shot. \n\nUnfortunately the first day of flying was marred by two serious incidents, all in the first squadron. Second flight's leader Postushenko was coming in for landing, and got a red flair just before touching down. His landing gear was up. Postushenko reported that the landing gear lever was in the down position. He kept pumping it, and shaking the aircraft left and right. The gear would not extend. Belly-landing was out of the question, with the flaming hot engines right on the bottom, and the fragile fuel tanks right next to it. Postushenko had to fly towards the woods and bail out.\n\nLess than an hour later Sgt Kapustin ran into a truck while taxiing. He claimed that the truck cut him off, while the truck driver said he's been trying to back away while honking his horn, and Kapustin still managed to clip him with his wing. \n\nThese two events were bad luck for the 1st squadron's commander Korotkov, and our regiment CO Inshukov. They might have been looking at a court martial. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nIn order to become more familiar with the new area, all pilots of the 183rd and 261st Regiments are ordered to fly along the river Dnepr in the area of the Soviet-German border. We are not to try to hide our presence; a Yak-15 of the 427th IAP has crashed in the German territory nine days ago, and they're by now aware of the existence of our new planes.\nIf you encounter German planes, you are immediately to pull back into our territory, and avoid a confrontation at all costs.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nTake your zveno on a familiarization flight over the German-Soviet border.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Yak-15\n\nLoadout: empty.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 0900 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters, and airspeed of 500 km/h. Crossing into the German territory is strictly forbidden.\n\nAttention: in the Loadout screen please select the RRG_Tail White Stripe.bmp paintscheme for your aircraft.\n\n
