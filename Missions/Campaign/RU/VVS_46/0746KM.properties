Short \n
Description Recce\n\nThe first day of the offensive failed. Some gains were made, but they were far short of the goals. Most of our push ran out of steam by the late afternoon, and virtually stopped. German units fell back to their second line of defense, and lay prepared for the next day's attacks. Many Soviet commanders were undoubtedly questioning their future; and the high-ranking members of the Stavka probably spent a sleepless night wondering if they had made a fatal mistake by attacking Germany. \n\nThe fighters in our sector failed to gain even local air superiority. Most of the bomber and sturmovik attacks on German targets failed to reach their target, or to conduct precise attacks. The losses were staggering: 95 aircraft to enemy fire and 117 to other causes. Only 64 German planes were claimed shot down by our units. \n\nDate: 23th of June1946\n          0900\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Peschanov\n\nI couldn't sleep. The day's events kept replaying in my head. We underestimated the enemy, and overestimated ourselves. This wasn't going to get any better tomorrow. I kept seeing the columns of burning tank hulls, and clusters of dead bodies floating down the Dnepr. So many people were dead and dying, and more would die tomorrow, and then the day after. Would I be one of those millions?\n\nThe thing that made me the angriest however was the work of our bombers, who continued to shower their own troops with bombs. Just in the last sortie, first our tanks got bombed by our own scared Sturmoviks, and then the Focke-Wulfs came up and finished the job. And I was just watching that helplessly. I knew that a full report of the action would get rejected, as usual, and I'd have to edit out the unfavorable information. The pilots of the 166th would of course report a dozen Tiger tanks destroyed with precision strikes. \n\nMission Briefing: \n\nInstead of the familiar window-frame, the FW-189, the Germans are reportedly using some new high-speed reconnaissance plane. It's well beyond the reach of our piston fighters. A pair of Yak-15s were dedicated to hunting down and destroying German recon planes in the Kanev sector. \n\nYour Objective:\n\nIntercept and destroy the German recon plane.\n\nYour Flight: 2 x Yak-15. \n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 0900 heading West. The patrol routie is marked on your maps. \n\n
