Description Change of Plans\n\nDate: 21th of June1946\n          1640\nWeather: Thunderstorm\nLocation: Zolotonosha\n\nThe main feature of the regiment CP was the giant map that took up the entire back wall. Tonight the entire squadron stood next to it. Everyone was quiet. The day was here. We were going back to war.\n\nTomorrow, on June 22nd, exactly five years after the dastardly German attack, our units would strike back and complete the final liberation of our motherland. We would go into battle alone, without any allies, but we were up to the task. The entire country worked towards this moment for the two peaceful years. It was up to us to make sure their hunger and their suffering would not have been wasted.\n\nMajor Inshukov was speaking solemnly, replicating the official tone of the SovInformBureau broadcasts we heard every day on the radio. \n\nOur 2nd Ukrainian Front is given the following tasks. In the first day of the offensive we are to take the border towns of Kanev and Pereyaslav-Hmelnitzki. Engineers will build pontoon bridges across Dnepr, which will be the main means of sustaining the offensive for at least the first 24 hours. Our forward units will continue onto Borispol and Korsun-Shevchenskovski, and by the end of the day on June 26th they are to link up with the 1st Ukrainian Front to the north-west, and the 3rd Ukrainian to the south-west. This will encircle remaining German troops, and they will be eliminated all the while our overall offensive continues forward.\n\nAll available aircraft will fly in support of the offensive, and will be at the disposal of frontline commanders. Our main priority will be maintaining an impenetrable umbrella over the pontoon bridges, as well as destroying the airfields at Borispol and Kiev and preventing any enemy aircraft from taking off in the vicinity of the front.\n\nDue to the short range of the Yak-15 fighter we are immediately relocating to the airfield at Peschanov. Updated orders will be provided there.\n\nThe weather is expected to be excellent in the next couple of days, so you'll be doing a lot of flying. Good luck, comrades!\n\nAs we left the room, I began to feel uneasy, and looking around I saw that other squadron leaders shared my feeling. We were hardly ready for a full-scale war. The regiment was barely capable of navigating in clear weather, and in this thunderstorm, no one could be sure that every plane would make it across to Peschanov. The loss of any aircraft tonight, right before the big battle, could prove fatal to anyone deemed responsible. \nMission Briefing:\n\nEach squadron is to fly separately and covertly to the Peschanov airfield. Maximum allowed altitude is 250 meters. Climbing above that altitude would increase the chances of discovery by German radar. After landing the aircraft are to be dispersed and camouflaged.\nSquadron leaders are held personally responsible for the success and for complete secrecy of this mission.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nArrange the rebasing of the 2nd fighter squadron on schedule and according to the overall plan. 1st squadron is going up at 1610; 2nd is to be ready at exactly 1640.\nExpected arrival time is 1650.\n\nYour Flight: 10 x Yak-15 \n\nLoadout: empty.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 1640 heading North-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 250 meters, and airspeed of 400 km/h. \n\n
