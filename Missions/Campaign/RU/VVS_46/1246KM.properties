Description The Shield\n\nThe free hunt was as successful as it was personally satisfying. Squadron leader Silaev shot down three FW-200s in a single sortie, and the rest of us didn't fare badly. The next day all of the free hunters were recommended for the Order of the Red Banner.\n\nDate: 5th of September, 1946\n          0915\nWeather: Fog \nLocation: Borispol\n\nGermans are using new tactics with their Arado jet bombers. They cross the front lines at extreme low altitude, penetrate deep into our territory avoiding detection, and bomb our supply columns and troop concentrations unimpeded, then escaping back home using their superior airspeed. By the time the interceptors would get on their trail, it'd be hopelessly cold. The Front HQ demands that these raids be stopped. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe entire 1st squadron of the 183rd is dedicated to the new task. It's probably impossible to intercept the bombers before their strike, so we will be patrolling the estimated strike area at top speed, and aim to catch the bombers on their return trip, after they give away their position by dropping their bombs. Be aware that the bombers have strong defensive armament, which however is static and can only fire directly backwards. Avoid attacks from that direction.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nPrepare to take-off and take the squadron to the holding airspace. The Germans use generally the same route for their retreat, so there's a good likelihood of intercepting them in the Gogolev  Puhovka sector.\n\nYour Flight: 10 x MiG-9FS\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off heading north-west and immediately head to Gogolev. The flight route is marked on your maps. Interception altitude is estimated at 500 to 1,000 meters.\n\n
