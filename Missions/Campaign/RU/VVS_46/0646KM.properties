Description Armor in Flames\n\nThe official declaration of war was given to the German ambassador in Moscow only at 1130. US and most other states issued strong condemnation of the Soviet actions, reproaching the USSR for breaking the terms of the 1944 Peace Treaty, and starting the third world war. However other than speeches, no other actions were taken. At noon Stalin spoke on the radio, calling the new war a just liberation of our oppressed brethren, and called for the Soviet people to rally around the communist party, and do anything possible to achieve the ultimate victory. \n\nDate: 22th of June1946\n          1725\nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Peschanov\n\nWe were facing our third sortie of the day. Pilots looked tired and dazed. Even the veterans were mostly unprepared for the new war. Almost two years of peacetime made them as weak as the rookies. And the initial shock of the crippling losses made most of us lose any desire to go back to the front and to risk our lives. We've been at peace! Why did we need to start this war again? \n\nAfter lunch we got more grave news. 1st squadron commander Korotkov was shot down together with his wingman, and crashed into the ground before he was able to bail out. The wingman, Lt Seregin, crash-landed in the field on our side of the lines. By the time our infantry pulled him out of the burning wreckage, he was already dead. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\n3rd Guards Tank Army is conducting offensive operations to the north-west of Pereyaslav.
