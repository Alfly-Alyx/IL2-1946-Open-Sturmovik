Description Bloody waters of Dnepr\n\nI knew things situation was normal in the war-time sense of the word as soon as I saw only 12 approaching sturmoviks. The second and third groups were nowhere to be seen. The fighters of the first wave failed in their appointed task as well, so we bore the brunt of the German response. Most of the V-1 installations were destroyed by the sturmoviks of the third wave, after we had left. The rocket strikes were stopped. Commanders got their medals. The victims were forgotten. The surviving pilots glad anyway, simply because they were still among the living. \n\nDate: 15th of September, 1946\n          1030\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Borispol\n\nOn the 13th of September we were briefed on the updated tactical and strategic aims of the upcoming offensive. On the 15th of September, Dnepr would be crossed near Vyshgorod and Obuhov, and would culminate in the encirclement and taking of Kiev. By the 6th of November the city had to be ours no matter the cost. Marshall Zhukov concentrated a formidable force at the front, which, according to intel, was 4 times larger than the defenders in the number of troops, and had 7 times the tanks and 16 times the artillery. The only relative parity was in aircraft. Zhukov requested even more troops, and at the last moment Stavka split off 24 artillery regiments and 10 more infantry divisions from other sectors of the front. \n\nSince the 10th of September Kiev has been constantly shelled and bombed. From afar we could see the great city slowly turn into burnt-out wasteland.\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe pontoons went over Dnepr at exactly 4 am, and by 9 the first units were already across the river. Initial Wehrmacht resistance was surprisingly weak, but the Luftwaffe came up in strength, and attacked the crossings incessantly. And the infantry, after establishing bare-bones bridgeheads, tried to advance and was cut down by murderous artillery and machine gun fire from hundreds of prepared positions. The offensive was grinding to a halt, and so the commanders kept throwing fresh forces straight into the German barrage, hoping to overwhelm the defenders by sheer numbers.\n\nAll available VVS resources were ordered into the area, without much organization or preparation and only with vague orders to support the offensive. \n\nYour Objective:\n\nTake two zvenos of MiG-9s to the crossing at Vyshgorod. Expect Yak-15s of the 654th IAP to arrive on station some time after you, and after their arrival you may return to base.\nEnemy opposition unknown.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x MiG-9FS\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at heading North-West \u0432 1020. The flight route is marked on your maps. Patrol altitude is between1,500 and 2,000 meters.\n\n
