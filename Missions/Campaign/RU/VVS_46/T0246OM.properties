Description At the Range\n\nDate: 27th of April, 1946\n          1530\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kostino\n\nWith Lenin's birthday coming up, in the usual fashion we were rushed to complete training by that date. On April 22nd even the main Soviet newspaper, Pravda, wrote a quick blurb about fearless Stalin's falcons of the 183rd IAP completing their conversion to incredible new machines with the highest marks, in honor of the momentous date. Most of us knew different. The incredible new machines were unstable, and our highest marks meant that a lot of the younger pilots barely got an hour or two of solo time. Fortunately, we managed to make due without any accidents. At least the Yakovlev OKB had a group of engineers stationed at the airfield that were always at our disposal; minor manufacturing defects were fixed on the spot, and for more major problems, the planes were sent back to the factory to be refitted. \n\nOur flight back to home base was scheduled for another momentous date, May 1st, the International Worker's Day. That gave us an extra week to train, which meant a new minimum of three hours of solo time for every pilot. Each pilot would now get to fly gunnery training, firing on a towed cone. The more senior pilots would also train leading four and even twelve-plane formations. \n\nFlight accidents suddenly began to happen in one large clusters. On the 23rd and 24th, three LaGG-3RD were totaled by 516th and 654th pilots, with two fatalities; and on the morning of the 25th, we finally got a Yak-15, with a 261st IAP pilot clipping the ground with his wingtip while showing off, and crashing into a building. \n\nOn the 26th, we suddenly got the orders to wrap up training before the previously assigned date, and to report back to Zolotonosh and Peschanov airfields near Kiev. The entire regiment was to load on a big train on the 28th. LaGG-3RD were already waiting for their pilots; our Yak-15s would arrive by another train a little later.\n\nWe all wondered why the plans were so drastically changed. There must have been a very good reason to miss another momentous date, and another mention in the papers.\n  \nMission Briefing:\n\nYou have time for one last training flight. Anyone else will have to complete training after relocating to the Ukraine. You are to take your flight to the gunnery range near Tagino, where four targets are located. You are assigned to the northernmost zone number 1.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nLead your zveno to the gunnery range, and conduct tests of forward-firing armament using targets placed around the designated area. You have the area to yourselves after 1540; before that time the range is assigned to the 654th IAP. \nBe very careful when diving. Do not exceed 700 km/h.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Yak-15\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 1530 heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. Maintain altitude of 1,000 meters, and airspeed of 500 km/h; your never-exceed airspeed is 700 km/h. \n\n
