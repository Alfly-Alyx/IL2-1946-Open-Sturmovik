Short Bunker Busting\n\nSupport allied troops landing on the beach by hitting bunkers along the beach\nPlayer Flies P-47\n
Description Allied troops are landing right now. The first wave is being cut apart by machine gun and artillery fire from the german lines.\nYou are inbound on the beach with two flights of P47s fully loaded. Do your best to support ground troops moving up the beach.\nYour pimary targets are the first two bunker complexes you will see after crossing the inlet. Your best bet will be to line yourself up to hit them both in quick succesion.\nThe Luftwaffe in the area are undersupplied so we expect little in the way of air ressistance.\n\n Template by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n\n
