Name 17.Dday 2
Short escape from behind enemy lines in a stolen FW-190A-8.\n
Description After ditching your P-38 you have managed to make your way to Caen Airbase.\n\nLuckily for you the Germans have left a 190 completley ungaurded. Get in it and go!!!!\nIts only partly fuelled and has no ammo at all but it will get you home if you keep your foot to the floor.\n\nYou will no doubt have AA fire and there will be fighters chasing you all the way!! Good Luck!!!\n\n(Reccomend turning markings off for this mission and using a skin of your choosing, otherwise your 190 will have russian markings)\n\nTemplate by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n
