Short Lead a recon sweep  over St. Gaiten Airfield\n\nPlayer Flies P-51C\n
Description We need a quick recon of St. Gaiten to see what the luftwaffe are up to.\most of their forces have been wiped and any remaining in the area should be retreating.\n\nSo we're giving you a squad of green pilots. You'll be the only pilot with combat experience so make sure to keep tight control of your wingmen.\nThe only resistance you should expect will be coming from the ground.\n\nTemplate by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n\n
