Description Hitler is attacking our base with V1 Flying bombs.\nYour squad of P51s is currently tracking at least 3 V1s.\nYou will Have a B17 in the area acting as a recon plane to help you find the rockets.\n\nDo what you can to take the rockets out. Remember they pack a lot of explosives, so if you fire on them try to take out the engine rather than the warhead. Or you could always try tipping them off course.\n\n\nTemplate by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n
