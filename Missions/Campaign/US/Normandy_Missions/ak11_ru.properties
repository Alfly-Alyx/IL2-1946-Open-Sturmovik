Short bomb LeHarve Harbour.\n\nPlayer flies B29\n
Description Now that we;ve sunk the Tripitz, we can finish off the harbour. A group of B29s will be used to finish the job.\nLead the task force and cripple whats left of the German fleet in LeHarve.\nExpect the Germans to sent some of their jet powered 262s to intercept. \nBecause of the range there are only 4 escorting P51s remaining, these guys are already low on fuel.\n\n\n Template by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n
