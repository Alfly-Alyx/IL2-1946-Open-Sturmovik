Short take out the  train depot at Saint Romain.\n\nPlayer flies B17G\n
Description Today we will pass over what is left of Le Harve and on to Saint Romain.\nThere is a train depot there that holds valuabe fuel for the axis. If we take it out we can not only destroy the fuel that is there. But slow down the resupply       rate of all troops in the area.\n\nAgain we dont have much in the way oof an escort, just a few P39s.\n\nYou must pass over LeHarve on the way to your objective and allow your bombadier to take a recon photo. We need to know what German naval assests survived the bombing. If any...\n\nExpect heavy flak in the east of LeHarve, as well as approaching your target.\n\nWe have no intelligence on Luftwaffe activity at the moment.\n\n Template by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n\n
