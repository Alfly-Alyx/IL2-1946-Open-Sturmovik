Name Canyon Run
Short Attack German trains escaping through a canyon\nplayer flies P-47\n
Description \nThe Germans are pulling back.\nAll remaining forces are being evacuated south in trains.\n\nThere is a train convoy headed south, through a nearby canyon.\nThis convoy is carrying troops, ammo and fuel and is being headed up by an armoured train.\n\nThe canyon itself is heavily defended, and you are all alone, so you are not being ordered to attack the convoy. Engage at your leisure and RTB at any time. Entering the canyon would be suicide for anyone but the best.\n\nShould you choose to engage, the armoured train at the lead can be considered a priority  target. Any trains you pass may be considered targets of oppertunity but save some ammo for the main target.\n\nTry your best to catch this train before it reaches the end of the canyon, the Germans have a nasty surprise waiting around the corner after the watchtower bridge!!\n\n\n Template by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n
