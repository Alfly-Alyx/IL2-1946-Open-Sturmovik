Short Escort C-47s carrying paratroopers into France on Dday\n\nPlayer Flies P-38\n
Description Its the early hours of Dday morning and C-47s are carrying paratroopers into France. They will fly deep behind enemy lines and drop troops on strategic targets.\n\nYou must fly escort for these C-47s in a P-38.\n\nFuel economy will be important here. Dont drop your tanks at the first sign of trouble, if you do you wont make it home.\nDon't worry about scoring kills, just get those troops on the ground. You probably wont have the fuel to go dogfighting anyway. Draw fire off the transports until the toops are out of them.\n  \nYour flight will cover two groups of  Transports.\nThey will break formation after crossing over the Atlantic Wall before Caen.\nStay with the group from the 67th squadron breaking west toward Loucelles. They will drop troops in the area to secure the bridges.\nOnce this group has deployed the paratroopers you will then break escort and head further south. Do your best to catch up with C47s from 30th squadron headed for St Martin. Provide any cover you can.\n\nRemember your fuel situation, try to keep your tanks as long as possible.\nIf yyou have to ditch, try ditch in a drop zone and link up with paratroopers. Or if you can make it back oover the Atlantiic wall, there should be plenty of ships to pick you up.\n\n\n Template by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n
