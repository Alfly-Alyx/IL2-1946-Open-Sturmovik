Name 1.Training Mission
Short Training Mission\n\nPlayer Flies Spitfire MkVIII\n
Description An easy practice mission to get you started. There is a C-47 circling the base towing a G-11 glider at 5000m. \nClimb to altitude and destroy the glider without hitting the towplane. Try to get above them and take out the glider with a clean shot on your first pass. Since the glider carries no fuel it will not explode. Try hitting the wingtips with your cannon.\nIf you hit the towplane or get to close the pilot may detatch, try to take out the glider before it is detatched.\nWhen the glider does detach, order the C-47 to RTB to complete the second primary objective for the mission.\n\nOnce you've completed the mission you could take the oppertunity to have a look around your new post.\n\nTemplate by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n
