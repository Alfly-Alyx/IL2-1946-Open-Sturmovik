Short Destroy stpaul airfield\n\nplayer flies B17G\n
Description Another Bombing run today. The target is St Paul airfield. \nUnfortunately no escort fighters are available. so youll be on your own from here on in.\n\nExpect heavy concentrationns of flak, and company from 109s and 110s.\n\nYour flight should target the small buildings in the centre of the airfield. We belive this to be a Barracks so look out for signs of human activity that your bombadier can use as a target.\n\n Template by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n\n
