Name 2.Defend base 1
Short Take your spit out and do your best against the incoming formation of He-111s.\n Player Flies Spitfire Mk.IXe.\n
Description All our lovely new planes that have just been delivered are about to  be blown awayy!! I  knew it was a bad   idea seending so many  planes to the same place, but nobody ever listens to me.\nThe Germans are sending a raid of 111s to take out as many of our aircraft on the  ground as possible.... This could cause us major problems obviously\nGet up there sharpish boys..  You will fly to  France and intercept the  bombers hopefully as they pass over LeHarve. They will be escorted by a number of 190s so spitfire pilots, make them your first target. Draw the escort away from the bombers so our Hurricanes can start taking them  down as soon as possible.\nGood luck boys, you'll need it!!\n\n Template by Team Normandie/2006\nlowfighter/Spectre/NHawk/Woody1/Ojisan_bart/~HH~ Beebop\n\n
