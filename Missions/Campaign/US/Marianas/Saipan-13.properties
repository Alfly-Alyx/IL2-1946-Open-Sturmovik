They have formed a right angle wedge in the enemys front.  The 2nd Marines fight down hill upon Mt. Tapotchau has made gains, but fierce resistance from a small clump of hills known as the pimples has slowed them down.  The 27th Division has completely taken Death Valley and Purple Heart ridge.  They are trying to move up even with the 4th Marines.\n\n  Japanese air was active again last night.  But no damage was inflicted by them.  The P-61s of the 6th Nightfighter Detachment were kept busy again, but no kills were claimed.\n\n  Navy Avengers are coming to orbit the airfield and wait for us to takeoff.  They will form up with us and join our strike.  We will be attacking anti aircraft artillery positions on Tinian near Ushi Point, concentrating on emplacements near the western shore.  The Colonel is leading this one.  Targets of opportunity will be allowed after the strike, but no further attacks to the south of Ushi Point as it has not been cleared yet.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
