Name Marianas Campaign
Short Fly with the 318th.\n
Description Date: 25th June 1944 (Sunday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Resconnaisance\n\nConditions:Time: 0730,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: None\n\nBriefing: Mt. Tapotchau's crest hasn't fallen yet.  The fight for and around Death Valley still rages on, after a half hearted attack by the 27th Division yesterday.   The 27th's Division commander was relieved yesterday afternoon, after complaints from General Smith of the 4th Marine Division.  It's the first time that I have ever heard of, where a Marine General has had an Army General relieved.   Despite this, more gains were made on the flanks.\n\n   Several reports yesterday afternoon mentioned a position of interest north of Mt. Tapotchau.  So we have drawn a recon flight this morning.  Don't forget to arm your gun camera on this one.  You will be making high speed, low altitude passes over the target areas.  Command wants two passes made over the primary target and we will likely only be able to make one pass over the secondary.  Your ammuntion has been removed so you don't ruin the pictures.  Remember, to be of any use, the film has to make it back to base.\n\n  Last night the Navy was prepared for any monkey buisness.  They laid smoke screens over the transport area and had Hellcat night fighters, from TF58, up with our P-61s.  They weren't disappointed, when some Japanese torpedo bombers made an attack on a transport but seemingly missed it.  The night fighters then intercepted and drove them off.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
