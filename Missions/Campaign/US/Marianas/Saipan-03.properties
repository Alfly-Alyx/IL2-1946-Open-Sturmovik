Description Date: 22nd June 1944 (Thursday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Ground Attack\n\nConditions:Time: 0730,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: None\n\nBriefing:  Some gains were made on the Nafutan Point, but the enemy continues to hold out.  The 4th Marine and 2nd Marine Divisions are making a big push for Mt. Tapotchau today.  Our operations today will be in support of that push.  First we will attack enemy gun emplacements on Kagman Peninsula.\n\n  Yesterday the Navy found and sank a Japanese submarine 90 miles northeast of Saipan.  Further south at an Island called Rota, aircraft from the escort carrier  USS White Plains sank a transport ship in Rota's harbour.\n\n  With the Navy handling anti-submarine patrols and combat air patrols for now, it allows us to concentrate on close support.  Navy ships are heading back to support us here on Saipan after whats being called the Marianas Turkey Shoot.  The bulk of the invasion forces and supply ships are still to the east of Saipan.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
