Description Date: 4th July 1944 (Tuesday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Ground Attack\n\nConditions:Time: 1640,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: None\n\nBriefing: Its not exactly the kind of 4th of July one would expect, but there has been plenty of fireworks.  The fighting has been more intense then the last two days.  The Japanese have set up a new defensive line.  The strongest point of that line is upon a hill in the 4th Marine Division's sector.  Saipan's width being to narrow at this point along the island for three divisions abreast, the 2nd Marines have been placed into reserve.  The 27th Division took the seaplane base at Flores Point, as the day has wore on the division has almost encircled the town of Tanapag.  The 4th Marines made a heavy attack upon the new defensive line.  Hitting its strongest point and overrunning it.  They are calling it "4th of July Hill".\n\n    A flight from the 73rd is attacking near Tanapag.  A PBM patrol plane spotted some Japanese landing barges at an island called Aguijan, south of Tinian.  It seems they traveled from Rota during the night and are awaiting darkness to complete the trip.  Our flight will attack them.  We will concentrate on their barges and any shipping.  The intention is to strand them there.\n\n   The Navy found and sank a Japanese submarine 100 miles ENE of Saipan today.  The destroyer hunter killer groups have done an outstanding job and not a single submarine has gotten any where near Saipan.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
