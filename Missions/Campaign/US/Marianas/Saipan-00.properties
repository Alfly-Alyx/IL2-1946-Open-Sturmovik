Description Date: 20th June 1944 (Tuesday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\nShip: Natome Bay\n\nMission: Squadron Move\n\nConditions:Time: 1400,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: None\n\nBriefing:  The squadron is being catapulted from the deck of the USS Natome Bay (CVE-62) then forming up for the flight to Saipan.  Once there to land at Aslito Airfield.\n\n  All of the US transport fleet is east of Saipan as the battle of the Philippine Sea is still raging to the west of it.  So far It looks like an outstanding Victory for the Navy.  Someone said it was a turkey shoot with over 300 Jap planes shot down.   Those Hellcat flyboys have earned their pay on that one.  The battle though has left few naval vessels at Saipan to support the troops on the ground. \n\n  You will carry empty belly tanks.  They will be removed after landing at Aslito field and stockpiled for future use.  Your guns are loaded, but no other ordnance will be carried.\n\n\n* Player use skin P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp ( turn markings off ) and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
