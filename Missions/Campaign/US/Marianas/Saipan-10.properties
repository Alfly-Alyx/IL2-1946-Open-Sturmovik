Description Date: 27th June 1944 (Tuesday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Ground Attack\n\nConditions:Time: 0700,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: 4500ft\n\nBriefing:  At 0230 this morning we had a fight on our hands.  Japanese holdouts from the Nafutan Point area snuck past a battalion of the 105th RCT that was supposed to have that area blocked off.  Army engineers and Seabees stopped them here at the airfield before they could cause to much damage, they then moved on to the Hill 500 area.  There they ran smack dab into two Marine regiments.  It was a nasty fight.  In the end the Japanese group was wiped out.  The Marines took 33 casualties.\n\n  Because of the fighting last night we are getting a late start this morning, checking for damage.  The first mission today is a strike upon Tinian.  We must continue working over the AAA defenses there, 500lb'er bombs have been fitted.  The rest of the ground staff for the 318th came ashore early this morning and are rather worn out after a long night of their own.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off): P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n \n
