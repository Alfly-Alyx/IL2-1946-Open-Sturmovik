Short Fly with the 318th.\n
Description Date: 24th June 1944 (Saturday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Airfield Attack\n\nConditions:Time: 0545,Visibility: Good, Cloud Height: 4500ft\n\nBriefing: Mt. Tapotchau still hasn't fallen, nor has Death Valley, but gains upon their flanks were made yesterday.\n\n   The 73rd flew a few missions, but spent most of yesterday settling in.  For some reason they just aren't used to having snipers firing upon the flight line.\n\n   Last night, before midnight, a lone Japanese bomber dropped a stick of bombs just in the wake of Admiral Oldendorf's flagship, the USS Louisville.  About an hour after midnight, a group of high level bombers attacked the anchorage off of the Charan Kanoa beachhead.  They damaged an LST, an LCT, two Patrol Ships, and a repair ship.  Inflicting about 20 casualties.\n\n  Flying in from Eniwetok sometime today is a detachment of the 6th Nightfighter Sqaudron with P-61 Black Widows.  They are sorely needed, as the only time the Japanese seem to show up is after dark.   The Navy flyboys will be attacking other airfields on Guam and Rota today.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
