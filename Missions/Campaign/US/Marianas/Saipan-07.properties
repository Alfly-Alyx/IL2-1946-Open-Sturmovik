Its our turn again, and we are headed for Death Valley.  Due to the closeness of friendlies all around that area, we have to use rockets and guns.  The are reports of a lot of light machineguns and some anti-aircraft guns there as well.  Watch out for ground fire.\n\n  Those P-61s sure are strange looking bird.  Only four of them came in, but their crews said they would be ready to fly tonight.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
