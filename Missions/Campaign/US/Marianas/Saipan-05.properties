Name Marianas Campaign
Short Fly with the 318th.\n
Description Date: 23rd June 1944 (Friday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Close Air Support\n\nConditions:Time: 0915,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: None\n\nBriefing: The big push by the 2nd Marine Division towards Mt. Tapotchau continues.  The Army 27th Division is just east of Mt. Tapotchau with the 4th Marine on its right flank.  The 4th Marines have taken Laulau.  The valley below Mt. Tapotchau's eastern slope has become known as the Valley of Death and Purple Heart ridge guards the valleys eastern boundary.  The Japanese are well dug in there with caves and bunkers throughout the area.  Hidden artillery has the area well covered and fire seems to come from everywhere.\n\n   Our operations today have been heavy again today, so far.   We will attack the same gun emplacements on Mt. Tapotchau again.  They are heavily dug in up there.  The front is marked by white panels with a red arrow pointing at the enemy from behind our line.  Your target is marked by white phosphorus.  Between the constant noise and little or no sleep, lack of ground staff, Japanese snipers and patrols, and the heavy operations, its a wonder anyone of us can still fly.\n\n   Coming in throughout the day from an escort carrier to the east is another 318th FG squadron, the 73rd, to give us a hand.  Navy Avengers will attack the Garapan area as well.\n\n   Last night while the Navy was firing starshells in supporting Marine operations on Mt. Tapotchau, a lone betty torpedo bomber got past the naval screen undetected.  It neatly dropped a torpedo, that struck the battleship USS Maryland, then escaped without a shot being fired at it.  The Maryland had to sail back to port after that.  The other capital ships, of Admiral Oldendorfs fire support group put further out to sea for the rest of the night.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
