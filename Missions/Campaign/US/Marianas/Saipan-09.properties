Name Marianas Campaign
Short Fly with the 318th.\n
Description Date: 26th June 1944 (Monday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Ground Attack\n\nConditions:Time: 0920,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: None\n\nBriefing: Mt. Tapotchau's crest hasn't fallen yet, but some gains were made towards or around the crest area.  The fight for and around Death Valley still rages on.  The 27th Division made some headway along Purple Heart ridge on the eastern flank of Death valley.   The 4th Marine Division overran the Kagman peninsula taking the beach defenses from behind.\n\n   That artillery position we filmed yesterday was attacked later in the day by 318th aircraft.  The real suprise though, were the planes at one of the Ushi Point airfields on Tinian.  The Navy quickly dispatched a gunfire support ship to close with the shore and shell them.  After that mission though, I found an oil leak coming from the engine.  It took the rest of the day to find enough mechanics and parts to fix it.  She's all ready for todays mission.\n\n   We are attacking  the area between Garapan and Tanapag.  A flight from the 73rd and some Navy Avengers are also hitting the area.  The flights times over the target are staggered so there shouldn't be any worries of collision.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
