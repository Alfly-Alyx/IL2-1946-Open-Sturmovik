Name First Strike
Short First Strike\nBy BH-21\n\nFly the first strike from Saipan soon after the squadrons arrival.\n
Description Date: 20th June 1944 (Tuesday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Ground Attack\n\nConditions:Time: 1800,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: None\n\nBriefing: Having arrived at Aslito field the 19th FS has dispersed its aircraft about the field, though not to far away.   Fighting is still going on near by.  \n\n  Fuel was waiting for us at the field, but with hand pumps it will take forever to refuel a single plane, let alone the entire squadron.  So pairs are being made ready, fueling them as fast as possible.  Your planes brought in .50 caliber ammo already loaded, any that was fired off will be replaced.  To make matters worse in rearming, we don't have a full ground staff, like back in Hawaii.  Even the pilots have to pitch in to help rearm.  Rocket tubes are being mounted for a strike on the first pair.  \n\n  At Ushi point on Tinian the enemy still has some coastal guns there.  They are firing at our supplies and troops at the Charan Kanoa beachhead.   They have to be put out of action.  Approach from the west and on the deck.  The Japanese still have plenty of AAA over there.  So try to stay low.  The wingman will likely have to supress the AAA for the leader and vice versa.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n \n
