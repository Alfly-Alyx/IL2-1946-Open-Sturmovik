Description Date: 27th June 1944 (Tuesday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Airfield Attack\n\nConditions:Time: 1330,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: None\n\nBriefing: Mt. Tapotchau's crest has fallen to elements of the 2nd Marine Division.  The 27th Division took the bulk of Death valley as the 4th Marine Division advanced as far as Hashigoru.  The Japanese suprised the headquarters of the 165th Regiment last night while the battalion commanders were meeting to plan their activities for today.  Two tanks charged into the Regimental area along the norh end of Purple Heart ridge and escaped after wounding 61 and killing 12 including a battalion commander.\n\n   It seems the transport area off Charan Kanoa was under air attack again last night.   A quarter past 2300 a low flying Japanese torpedo plane collided with the cargo boom of the freighter Mercury and fell apart.  Its torpedo though, entered the ships superstructure, but failed to explode.   The Mercury had a long night.  The nightfighter guys are a bit embarrassed over it, they never saw the enemy.\n\n   The area between Garapan and Tanapag is being attacked by a flight from the 73rd and some Navy Avengers  We will be attacking the airfield on an island to the south of Tinian, called Rota.  The first flight will carry rockets and contrentrate on anti-air defenses on the first pass.  The second flight will carry 500lb'ers to crater the runway.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
