Name Marianas Campaign
Short Fly with the 318th.\n
Description Date: 2nd July 1944 (Sunday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Close Air Support\n\nConditions:Time: 0933,Visibility: Good, Cloud Height: 4500ft\n\nBriefing: The 2nd Marines took the Pimples area yesterday.  The 27th Division's left flank advanced along with the 2nd Marine Division, but its right flank remained in place.   Japanese resistance seems to have slackened.   Less resistance has been encountered in todays operations so far as well.  Our troops have been advancing all along the front.\n\n    A flight from the 73rd will be attacking positions on Tinian near Ushi Point again.  The pattern of air activity over Saipan has changed some.  We no longer need to orbit waiting for support calls or large flights to soften up areas.  Small flights on alert can be called to attack key targets in short order.  It is one of these missions that we have drawn today.  A call has come in for an attack on an enemy tank holding up our Marines.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
