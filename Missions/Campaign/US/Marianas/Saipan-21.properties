Name Marianas Campaign
Short Fly with the 318th.\n
Description Date: 7th July 1944 (Friday)\n\nUnit: 19th FS, 318th FG\n\nMission: Ground Attack\n\nConditions:Time: 1000,Visibility: Clear, Cloud Height: None\n\nBriefing: Last night was a hectic night.  3,000 Japanese charged into the lines of the 27th Division at 0445 screaming "Banzai".  They supprised the 105th Regiment.  The 1st Battalion of the 105th was overrun, killing their battalion commander.  The Japanese advance was slowed down by a marine artillery battery near Tanapag village but it too was overrun, though not before expending much of its ammunition into the attackers.  The fight mired down near the village as the 27th Division's troops rallied and established a defensive position there.  Then came the cruelest cut of the whole episode.  Army artillery assumed the perimeter around the village to be Japanese and fired into it, driving many of the surviving men into the water.  Many swam out to a reef where they were later rescued.\n\n    We will be making a strike on Tinian.  More and more of our missions will be over Tinian.  The number of missions over Saipan has diminished to a couple alert strikes a day.  Two flights will take part in this strike armed with 500lb'ers.  You will hit 75mm Dual Purpose guns and coastal guns at Faibus San Hilo Point on Tinian.  Avoid overflights of the island itself.\n\n   Japanese Air also showed up last night.  Torpedo bombers attacked ships in the roadstead with no success.  Eight bombers attacked the beachead from high level, but missed their target in the dark.  The destroyer Hudson shot down one attacker and Hellcat night fighters from TF58 claimed two others.\n\n\n* Player use skin (turn markings off) P47D22-19FS-318thFG_stars_G.bmp and Pilot skin US_00*\n\n
