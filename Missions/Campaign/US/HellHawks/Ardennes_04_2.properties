Name Road Recon Over Houffalize
Short The weather is getting bad again but we heard the Germans are moving through Houffalize. Take a flight over the city and look for any enemy columns on the roads.  \n
Description Date: December 18th 1944\n\nTime: 1500 hours\n\nBriefing:\nThis afternoon's mission will be armed recon between here and Saint Vith. With the weather getting worse,  I would suggest flying along the roads to Manhay and then south to Houffalize. From there head northeast towards St. Vith and see how far the German Panzers have advanced. If you see anyone, just make sure they are hostile before you open fire. We may have some stragglers trying to make it back to our lines. \nYou will be armed with 500 lb bombs and rockets in case you run into any tanks. \nThat's all. \n
