Name Flak Attack
Short Close air support in the Bastogne area.\n
Description Date: December 24th 1944\n\nTime: 0800 hours\n\nBriefing: \nThis morning we will be heading back to the Bastogne area to hit the German units surrounding the town. We need to knock out some of the flak in the area so the Gooney Birds don't have such a rough time of it. Four were shot down yesterday.The Luftwaffe has been coming out to play so I think we can expect to see more of them today. \n1st flight, you will drop your bombs on the flak positions and 2nd flight will provide cover. 1st flight will climb & cover 2nd flight as they drop on any remaining AAA batteries. \nWe will strafe any visable enemy positions on our way back.\nThat's all for now.  \n
