Description Date: December 20th 1944\n\nTime: 0630 hours\n\nBriefing:\nWe will be leaving for Chivres, Belgium this morning. We are way too close to the front line and the German tanks will be within firing range by this afternoon if they keep moving at the speed they have been going.\nThe C-47s are loaded with the relief pilots & your gear. The ground crew is leaving by truck as we speak and all that remains is to get the aircraft off the ground and fly to your new base.\nSee you there.\n\n
