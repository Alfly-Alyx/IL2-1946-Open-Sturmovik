You will be going back up to St. Vith with bombs to keep those tanks out of town. \nWe heard that a flight of lightnings got clobbered by 109's this morning so keep your eyes open and your head on a swivel. Dump your bombs on their heads and get the hell out of there. They are right on the edge of town and our boys on the ground need help!\nGood luck and good hunting.\n
