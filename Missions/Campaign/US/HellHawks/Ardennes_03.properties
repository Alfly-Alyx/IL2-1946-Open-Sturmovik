Name Hunting the Command Convoy
Short The Panzers have overrun Clerveaux. Search the roads east of Houffalize and look for the command column.\n
Description Date: December 18th 1944\n\nTime: 0900 hours\n\nBriefing:\nThe German Panzer division which attacked Clervaux yesterday seems to have overrun their position and is continuing to the west. We will take two flights and search the roads for them.\nTry to locate the command convoy on the road to Bastogne. If we can nail them, I am sure it will slow the tanks down until the 101st Airborne division can make it to Bastogne.  The ground units have asked us to use rockets as much as possible to prevent friendly casualties, but we will load up with two 500 lb bombs on the lead flight.\nGood luck!\n
