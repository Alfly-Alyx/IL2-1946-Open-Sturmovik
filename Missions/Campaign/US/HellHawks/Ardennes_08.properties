Name Fighter Sweep
Short Lead a fighter sweep over Bastogne to search for enemy air activity.\n
Description Date: December 23rd 1944\n\nTime: 1400 hours\n\nBriefing: \nYou are going back up this afternoon for a Combat Air Patrol over Bastogne. Continue on over Wiltz and look for any friendly activity. We need to know if Patton's 3rd army has made it that far north yet. \nThe Luftwaffe was out this morning and I think we can expect them to try & drop a few bombs on our boys at the front. They aren't getting any rest out there so you guys hurry up and get back in your planes. They need your help out there!\nWe have loaded extra ammo so this is the day you have been waiting for. It is time to shoot down some Huns. Maybe one or two of you will make ace before this is over after all!\n
