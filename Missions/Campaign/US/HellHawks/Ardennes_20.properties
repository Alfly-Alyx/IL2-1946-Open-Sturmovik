Name The Final Blow
Short Combat Air Patrol over the front lines.\n
Description Date: January 3rd 1945\n\nTime: 1530 hours\n\nBriefing: \nAll right guys, this is really your chance to kick some ass! The FAC in Bastogne reports alot of enemy air activity in the area and with the weather expected to close in tomorrow, we think the Luftwaffe will try to send out as many sorties as possible.\nYou guys with the most experience will put together a combat air patrol and go knock down some enemy fighters. This is definatly the payback we were looking for this morning. \n We will give you full ammo loads for the wing guns and you will be happy to hear that the ground troops have liberated an airfield just to the East of Bastogne if you run low on fuel or need emergency landing facilities.\nThat's all and Good Hunting!\n
