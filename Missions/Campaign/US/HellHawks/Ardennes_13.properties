Name Convoy Interdiction
Short Attack ground traffic on the road between Gouvy & Houffalize\n
Description Date: December 25th 1944\n\nTime: 1600 hours\n\nBriefing: \nWe have reports of heavy traffic on the road between Gouvy and Houffalize. There are numerous convoys on the move towards the Panzer spearheads and this should be a good opportunity to catch them in the open.\n You will be carrying the normal load of 2 500 lb. bombs so after they are gone, you can strafe or engage enemy air if necessary. \nGood luck & good hunting!\n\n
