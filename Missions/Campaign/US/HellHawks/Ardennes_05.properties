Name Destruction at Longvilly
Short Take a flight down towards Bastogne and help out the tankers fighting to defend the northern approach.\n
Description Date: December 19th 1944\n\nTime: 0830 hours\n\nBriefing:\nThe bulk of the fighting seems to be just north of Bastogne where the armored cavalry is fighting at Noville. One of their other elements is at Longvilly just to the east.  \nTake out any panzers you can spot moving in towards Noville. After you drop your ordnance, fly southeast over Wiltz and take a look around. We still have people there but we are not sure of the situation. An intelligence team drove into Bastogne this morning saying the Germans were close but they were sent back since the road is still clear\n
