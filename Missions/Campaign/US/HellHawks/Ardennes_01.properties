Name Road Recon to St. Vith
Short Take a trip aroung the city and check for enemy activity\n
Description Date: December 17th 1944\n\nTime: 1030 hours\n\nBriefing: OK guys, listen up! I know it sounds hard to believe but we have got to go out in this mess and recon the road on the other side of Saint Vith. The word is that there are German Panzers heading in our direction. If we can't stop them, we may have to evacuate the field. There are also reports of paratroopers landing northeast of here but we are not sure.\nI need 4 volunteers to go and I won't blame anyone who doesn't raise their hand. \nYou will be carrying 500 lb bombs and rockets if the crews have been able to load them in this blizzard. That's all & good luck!\n
