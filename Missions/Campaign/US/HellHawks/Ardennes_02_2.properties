Name Close Air Support at Clervaux
Short Lead 2 flights over Houffalize to Clervaux and provide air support for the forward position there.\n
Description Date: December 17th 1944\n\nTime: 1600 hours\n\nBriefing:\nAll right guys, I know you are tired but we just got a radio call from Clervaux. A group of panzers are heading for town and they need air support. \nKnock out the tanks heading into town from the southeast.\nWe will be sending 2 flights armed with 500 lb bombs. You should probably have a 4 second delayed fuse rigged to keep from fragging yourselves. This will definately be a low level attack.\nGood luck and good hunting!\n
