Name Resupply Bastogne
Short Escort the C-47s to Resupply Bastogne.\n
Description Date: December 23rd 1944\n\nTime: 0630 hours\n\nBriefing:As you all know, Bastogne is surrounded and supplies are running out. The 101st Airborne is holding out but they can't last much longer without ammo, bandages and food. \nAfter three days of fog & snow, the weather is finally clearing & all the Jugs are loaded and ready to go. You can expect the Germans to be flying in force because the front is coming in from the East.\nYou will each be carrying 2 500lb bombs and your job is to escort the Gooney Birds to Bastogne for the resupply drop & then to drop your ordnance on any enemy traffic you see on your way out. You can expect a wall of flak around the city but hey, look on the bright side. At least you aren't driving a supply truck!\n Good luck & good hunting!\n
