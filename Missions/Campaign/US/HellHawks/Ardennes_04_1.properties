Name Recon to Bastogne
Short The weather is turning sour again but we need to know what is going on around Bastogne. I need 2 volunteers to fly down there and see what is happening on the roads south of Houffalize.  \n
Description Date: December 18th 1944\n\nTime: 1500 hours\n\nBriefing:\nToady's mission will be reconnaisance over Bastogne. With this weather I would suggest flying down the river to Houffalize & then turning south. Follow the road over Noville and take a low pass over Bastogne to see what is going on. If that goes OK turn east & pass over Clervaux on your way back. You may find some targets moving on the roads. Just make sure they are hostile before you open fire. We may have some stragglers trying to make it back to our lines. \nWe will send you off without bombs since you probably won't see much anyway.\nThat's all. \n
