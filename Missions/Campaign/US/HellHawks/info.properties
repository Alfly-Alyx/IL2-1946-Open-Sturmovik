Name The Hell Hawks
Description Welcome to the 9th Tactical Air Force. Your mission here is to support the troops on the ground and act as mobile artillery to destroy the enemy on the front line. There are no "Glory Boys" here!\nYour new best friend will be the P-47D Thunderbolt."The Jug" as we call it, is the best suited aircraft you could want for this job. It can carry a huge load of ordnance, take a hell of a beating over the target, fight the best of the enemy in the air and still bring you home.\nWe have just gotten a report that at least 2 Panzer Divisions have broken through our lines in the Ardennes Forest. We are the closest ground support unit to the front line so get ready for action!
