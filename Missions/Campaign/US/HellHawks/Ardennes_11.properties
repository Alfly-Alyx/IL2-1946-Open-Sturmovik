Name Bridge Attack
Short Railway bridge attack over the Our River\n
Description Date: December 24th 1944\n\nTime: 1500 hours\n\nBriefing: \nThis afternoon we will be attacking the Hosingen Bridge over the Our River. We need to take out this railroad bridge to prevent supplies from reaching the Panzer units. \nYou will each be carrying a 1000 lb bomb on the new universal centerline racks we just had installed. On your way back watch out for ground traffic. The Germans are moving in fuel by rail and we want to destroy as much of their supply as possible.\nThat's all for now.  \n
