Description Today gentlemen, will see your first sortie over enemy territory.\n\nDate: Wednesday 1st December 1943\nTime: 09:00\nWeather: Hazy\nCloud Height: 4,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 135 miles\n\nTwo flights of four will be making a sweep over the Cap de Calais, Belgium.\n\nLuftwaffe activity in the area has been relatively nonexistent so it should be a walk in the park.\n\nLoaded with extra fuel in the form of 75 gallon drop-tanks, you're expected to take off at 09:00 hours and head due south until you reach the coast. After a climb to 10,000 feet turn south-east. You'll have crossed the Channel over Calais after about half an hour in the air.\nOnce you've made a sweep of your appointed patrol zone in Belgium, head for home.\n\nToday, the first flight will fly a direct course, with the second flight providing top cover.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS.bmp\n************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*****************\n\n\n\n
