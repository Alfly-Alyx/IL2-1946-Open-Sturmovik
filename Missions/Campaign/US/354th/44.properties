Description We took a hell of beating down here on the ground the other night.\nWe can't afford to let that happen again.\nIt's a good job we were expecting supllies.\n\nSo the new fighters have arrived.\nI know that most of you were expecting the new Mustang instead of these Thunderbolts.\nWell, for the time being, we'll have to make do with what we've got.\nAt least we have some new ordnance loadouts to play with.\n\nDate: Monday 6th November 1944\nTime: 10:00\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Height: 2,300 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 37 miles\n\nArgentan is to be our destination today.\nThere should be plenty of ground targets to aim your rockets at.\nWatch out for flak though.\n\nTake off and climb t o around 4,000 feet. Once you've reached altitude turn to the south east.\nYoushould find yourselves over Argentan after around 12 minutes.\nThe enemy appear to be concentrated around the south east of the city.\n\nThere is a small airfield nearby, we're not sure if the Luftwaffe are capable of launching a counter attack from there though.\n\nTake care of each other and mind you don't damage our new Thunderbolts.\n\nSKIN 354thFG_355thFS_P-47.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*******************\n\n\n\n\n
