Short Saturday 17th June 1944\nHitler's dreaded secret weapon has finally arrived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description Hitler's dreaded secret weapon has finally arrived.\nThe first 'bombs' fell on the South of England four days ago and have been falling steadily since.\n\nThe devices, code-named 'divers' are about 25 feet long with a wing span of about 17 feet. They are jet-propelled pilotless monoplanes which travel at around 250 mph at altitudes ranging from between 2,000 and 3,000 feet.\n\nWe are to assist in defending southern England against these things.\n\nDate: Saturday 17th June 1944\nTime: 19:00\nWeather: Good \nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\nApprox. distance to patrol zone: 21 miles\n\nTake off and climb to around 8,000 feet before turning south-east to begin a wide anti-clockwise sweep of the area between Beachy Head and Dover and ranging out about 10 or 11 miles into the Channel.\n\nKeep your eyes peeled. These things aren't easy to\nspot but you may catch sight of ther distinctive smoke trail.\n\nIf you do manage to get into a position to fire on one of these 'divers' make sure you open fire from a good distance out from the thing. They are carrying a lot of explosives and will easily take you out if you are too close when one explodes.\n\nThe skies will be busy today as there are already several RAF Spitfire units in the air.\n\nThe first one to bring down one of these things will get a warm reception at the 'Fox and Hounds.'\nThe landlord's mother Mabel lost her house in a diver attack on Thursday night and he's offered a small reward for the first pilot with a confirmed 'kill'\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS_Invasion.bmp\n***********************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n\n\n
