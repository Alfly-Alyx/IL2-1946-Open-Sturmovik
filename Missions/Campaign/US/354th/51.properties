Name Hit and run
Short Wednesday 3rd January 1945\nA Nazi encampment to the south east of the battle field is to be your target for today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description Good grief! So that was the Messerschmitt 262 we've been told about.\nThat is an awesome plane!\n\nWe lost far too many good pilots in that last mission.\nWe can't let that happen again.\n\nIf we're going to go up against more of those jet fighters we need faster, more manoeuvrable planes.\nThe 262s do burn nicely when you hit them though, don't they?\n\nDate: Wednesday 3rd January 1945\nTime: 15:30\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 35 miles\n\nA fierce tank battle is currently underway between Ouren and Hosingen.\n\nA Nazi encampment to the south east of the battle field is to be your target for today.\nThis is where their reinforcements are holed up.\n\nThe Luftwaffe have two operational airfields nearby so the area is extremely dangerous.\n\nIt has been decided to send you out in three main waves in three minute intervals.\nObviously the first wave will face the heaviest oppositon. Hopefully you will take out enough guns on the ground to give the second wave a easier route through.\nWave two are to concentrate on destroying as many tanks as you can.\nHopefully the third wave will then find the area cleared.\nIf not, you know what to do.\n\nSKIN 354thFG_355thFS_P-47.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*******************\n\n\n\n\n\n
