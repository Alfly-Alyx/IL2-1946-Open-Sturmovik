Description Keep it up lads.\nThe war effort needs pilots like you.\n\nDate: Sunday 20th February 1944\nTime: 14:15\nWeather: Good\nCloud Height: 4,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 93 miles\n\nIntelligence has been monitoring the German shipping fleet in the Channel.\nApparently two of their minelaying vessels have gone in for repairs.\n\nYou'll find them in the harbor at Dieppe. They are effectively a pair of sitting ducks.\nTake a couple of 'one thousand pounders' and destroy the ships.\n\nTake off and climb to 5,000 feet heading due south. As you cross the coast at Dover turn on a south-easterly heading and fly directly to Dieppe.\n\nIt seems unlikely that you'll face an aerial assault but anti-aircraft fire from the ground and from the ships themselves will be enough to deal with.\n\nOnce you've released your payload take a reciprocal course home.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS.bmp\n************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*****************\n\n\n\n\n
