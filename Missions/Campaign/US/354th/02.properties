Description Today we're moving to our new base at Boxted, Essex.\nWe'll be fully operational in a matter of weeks now.\n\n\nDate: Saturday 13th November 1943\nTime: 09:00\nWeather: Blind\nCloud Height: 2,500 feet\nApproximate distance to new base: 94.5 miles\n\nWith the weather conditions out there, today's flight is an ideal time to familiarise yourselves with the Mustang's instruments.\nYou're going to be carrying a pair of 75-gallon drop-tanks. Although you won't actually be needing the extra fuel, it'll be useful to familiarise yourselves with the handling characteristics of the Mustang under the extra load.\n\nOur new base at Boxted is situated to the east-south-east of here, and should take just over 30 minutes to reach.\n\nStay close together and you won't get lost amongst the 'pea-soup.'\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS.bmp\n************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*****************\n\n\n\n\n\n
