Short Monday 19th June 1944\nYou're going across the Channel mob-handed.\nYour mini strike-force should prove unstoppable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description Spotting them isn't a problem then, it's just catching them that's proving to be somewhat problematic.\nOfficialy 'they' are to be known as 'Flying Bombs' from now on.\n\nAs destroying them in the air is so difficult, let's try and destroy them at their source instead.\nOne destroyed launch site might mean 50 less bombs that fall on southern England tomorrow.\n\nDate: Monday 19th June 1944\nTime: 10:25\nWeather: Good \nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 35 miles\n\nYou're going across the Channel mob-handed.\nYour flight of Mustangs will be joined by Thunderbolts from 'The Wolfpack' and Lightnings from the 20th Fighter Group.\nYour mini strike-force should prove unstoppable.\n\nYou are heading south-east at around only 800 feet towards the Pas De Calais area.\nAs soon as you're over Lille turn to head due west where there are several small towns for you to investigate.\n\nAll targets are fair game but any 'Flying Bomb' launch sites are your priority.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS_Invasion.bmp\n***********************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n\n
