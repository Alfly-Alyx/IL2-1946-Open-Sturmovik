Description Our bombers have been having a hard time across the water. It's high time that they had some protection out there.\n\nDate: Sunday 5th December 1943\nTime: 12:00\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Height:  5,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 90 miles\n\nTwo flights of you will take off and meet up with Fortresses headed for a key Normandy bridgehead.\nYou are to guard them closely.\n\nAfter take-off head due south, you will see the Fortresses forming up overhead.\nThey will be climbing to an altitude of around 16,500 feet, so you'll need to ascend rapidly to catch them up.\n\nAll you have to do today is see them safely across the Channel and back again.\n\nWhat could be simpler?\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS.bmp\n************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*****************\n\n\n\n\n
