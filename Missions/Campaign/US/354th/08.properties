Name An early Christmas present
Short Thursday 23rd December 1943\nAn early Christmas present for the Huns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description With just two days until Christmas we're going to deliver an early present to the Huns in Northern France.\n\nDate: Thursday 23rd December 1943\nTime: 21:40\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 61.5 miles\n\nTonight we are flying to Siracourt.\nA combined USAAF and RAF bombing contingent have an important target in mind.\nWe're tagging along, as it were.\n\nYou've been airborne for about thirty-five minutes, with another twenty minutes or so until we reach the town of Siracort.\nYou are cruising at an altitude of around 13,000 feet.\n\nThe flak from below, although not to be ignored, shouldn't prove too problematic.\n\nNight fighters on patrol however may be a different matter.\n\nDon't let the Luftwaffe draw you into a dogfight if it means leaving the bombers stranded. If enemy fighters attempt to draw you away from the heavies then you can bet they have some friends ready to take up the mantle.\nThe bombers' survival is your principal objective.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS.bmp\n************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*****************\n\n\n\n
