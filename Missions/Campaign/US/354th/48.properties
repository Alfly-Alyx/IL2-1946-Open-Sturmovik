Name Bridgehead
Short Monday 18th December 1944\nBoth bridges leading to Hosingen must be destroyed today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description German Panzer divisions have forced their way into the Ardennes .\nWe must slow down the Nazi advance so that a counter attack can be prepared.\n\nWe are here to assist in the bombardment of the enemy behind the front line and to secure air superiority in the region.\n\nDate: Monday 18th December 1944\nTime: 10:00\nWeather: Good\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 33.5 miles\n\nThankfully the weather has improved since yesterday.\nYou'll have no trouble spotting your targets for today, they're big enough.\nBoth bridges leading to Hosingen must be destroyed.\n\nFour of you will take off immediately to carry out the task.\n\nThe first pair are to take out the road bridge while the other pair concentrate on the railway bridge.\n\nHosingen is 31 miles to the south east as the crow flies, and should take no more than around 12 minutes to reach.\nYou should avoid altitudes higher than around 4,300 feet in order to remain below the cloud base.\n\nIf your bombs go astray your rockets should prove more than adequate.\n\nFailure is not an option.\nTake out those bridges!\n\nSKIN 354thFG_355thFS_P-47.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*******************\n\n
