Short Wednesday 9th May 1944\nIt's absolutely pouring down outside so it's an ideal opportunity to sneak across the Channel and sink a ship or two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description Good!\nWhatever it was that the enemy needed, they'll have to make do without.\n\nDate: Wednesday 9th May 1944\nTime: 16:40\nWeather: Raining \nCloud Height: 4,600 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 53 miles\n\nThe port town of Le Havre is the target for today.\n\nIt's absolutely pouring down outside so it's an ideal opportunity to sneak across the Channel and sink a ship or two.\n\nYou'll take off from Runway Two heading south-south-west.\nClimb to around 5,000 feet.\nIf you remain on a steady course you will probably see the ships, anchored at the harbour in Le Havre, in plenty of time to plan your attack.\n\nDrop your bombs and head for home.\n\nWe don't anticipate an attack from the air as the Luftwaffe have been seemingly inactive during spells of poor weather.\nYou'd have thought that what with all that goose-stepping they'd be used to a bit of water.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS_Aged.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n\n
