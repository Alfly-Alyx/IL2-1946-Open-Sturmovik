Description So you survived your first encounter with the Luftwaffe.\nWell done. Just don't get complacent.\n\nDate: Monday 20th December 1943\nTime: 08:30\nWeather: Hazy\nCloud Height: 3,200 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 80 miles\n\nA German torpedo boat has been damaged and is limping towards Brest.\nOur Fortresses are going to try and sink it.\nYou'll be providing them with an escort.\n\nTake-off and climb to 22,500 feet where you should be in a position to form up with the heavies.\n\nThey will fly south-south-east to where the torpedo boat will likely be hugging the coastline.\n\nYour job is to protect the bombers.\n\nWhether their task is fulfilled or not is of no real concern to us, although their successes are our successes.\nJust make sure though that, should they fail, we aren't held responsible.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS.bmp\n************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*****************\n\n\n\n\n\n
