Name Spot the spotter
Short Friday 2nd April 1944\nRadar has detected a sole enemy plane on a heading which will take it over the river Solent. It's probably no more than a spotter plane but we should attempt an interception anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description Very impressive.\n\nThe Nazis in Criel will surely remember that day for a long time.\nWhat a versatile plane the Mustang is proving to be. No wonder the RAF have been singing it's praises for a while now.\n\nDate: Friday 2nd April 1944\nTime: 18:30\nWeather: Good\nCloud Height: 4,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 37 miles\n\nRadar has detected a sole enemy plane on a heading which will take it over the river Solent. It's probably no more than a spotter plane but we should attempt an interception anyway.\n\nA pair of you will take off and climb to 16,000 feet. Once you've reached altitude fly north-west and make a wide sweep around the Solent.\n\nAlthough you're going up with odds of two to one, don't forget that some of these recon planes are equipped with multiple gun-stations.\nI'm not telling you anything you don't already know of course, but we don't want anyone getting lazy out there.\nStay alert to the possibility of heavy return fire.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS_Aged.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n
