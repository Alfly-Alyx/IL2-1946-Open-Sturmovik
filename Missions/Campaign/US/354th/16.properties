Name Lightnings over Criel
Short Sunday 26th March 1944\nYou are on your way to flatten a marshalling yard in Criel.\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description Good stuff!\nI bet those Krauts have got one hell of a headache after that battering.\nA high-altitude recon plane flew over the area this morning and reported only minor damage to the castle. The few remaining enemy however appeared to be in rather a state of disarray.\n\nDate: Sunday 26th March 1944\nTime: 13:35\nWeather: Good\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 30 miles\n\nMore 'ground-pounding' for you today then.\nYou are on your way to flatten a marshalling yard in Criel.\nYou've been airborne for about forty-five minutes.\nYou are travelling south-east at an altitude of around 6,500 feet. Descend to around 3,000 feet before you approach the target zone.\n\nYou're being accompanied today by a squadron from 20th Fighter Group, piloting Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. The Lightning is proving to be extremely proficient in a ground-attack role but don't just admire the guys from the 20th as they work, get stuck in as well.\nYou've already proved that the Mustang can hold it's own on this type of mission.\n\nThere should be plenty of targets of opportunity so you ought to be able to rack up several ground-kills on this sortie.\nOnce you've dropped your bombs you should probably make a few strafing runs before heading for home.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS_Aged.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n\n
