Description July 15\nTime 1115\nWeather Clear\nCloud Hight ----\nTarget: Railway Bridge\nCruising altitude: 12500 feet\nEstimated flight time: 1 hour\n\n\tIts been nearly a month sense we landed here on June 18, D+12. Conditions are poor, but improving. So far we've had to survive off K rations and the occasional dehydrated stew. We're sleeping eight men to a tent, but that isn't to say we get much sleep. Right behind our tents in an Apple orchard, theres a 90mm AAA gun, and every night a handful of german raiders come over, and every night, those guns and a hundred others across the beachhead open up on them.\n\tToday we've been ordered to knock out a railway bridge crossing the Seine River. Moderate to Heavy flack is expected. 3rd flight will provide top cover. Lets hope this goes well.\n
