Description \n*** Mortain Airdrop ***\n\n----------\n\n\n08 AUG 1944\n\n0630 hrs\n\nSt. Paul Army Airfield\n\nWX: 2500' SCT, Temp: +16C, Wnd: 230/05, Altimeter 29.94\n\nTarget: AAA and Flak around the town of Mortain\nGround threats: AAA and Flak in target area\nAirborne threats: none anticipated\n\n------------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nThe dogfaces in Mortain are in a really tight spot. The only thing...other than our air support... that has kept them alive for the last 24 hrs, is their artillery. It's kept the krauts at bay, but they now have a huge problem.\n\nThey're running low on everything....ammo, fuel, food, but most importantly....batteries for their radios. If they don't get some juice for those radios soon, then all the arty in the world ain't gonna help them. \n\nTransport Command has some gooney birds headed their way for a very important air drop. Get down to Mortain and take out the AAA and flak before those C-47s get there. Those boys in the infantry will be VERY happy if those goonies get through....make sure they do.\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed.\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
