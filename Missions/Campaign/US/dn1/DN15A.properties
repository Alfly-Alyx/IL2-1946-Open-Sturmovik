Our Tempests will be joining the fray down there this afternoon, and  you'll be escorting them.\n\nWe have no idea what Jerry has in mind in the arena of air opposition, suffice to say that he desparately wants to buy his beloved Waffen SS as much time to escape the noose as he can. Keep your heads on a swivel, and protect those fighter-bombers.\n\nGood luck,\n\nPilot Officer J.H. "Jimmy" Whalen\n30th Squadron\nRoyal Air Force\n\n\n\n
