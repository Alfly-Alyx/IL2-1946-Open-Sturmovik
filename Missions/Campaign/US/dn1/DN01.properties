Description \n*** Welcome to the war! ***\n\n----------\n\n\n12 JUN 1944\n\n0820 hrs\n\nValognes Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: CAVOK (clear and visibility unlimited), Temp +15 C, Wnd 320/10, Altimeter 30.10\n\nTarget: none \nGround threats: none\nAir threats: none anticipated\n----------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nWelcome to The Show! \n\nI know you landed late last night from King's Cliffe.... I trust your crossing went well. This morning we officially enter the ground war. You will sortie on an orientation flight down Utah beach. The 4th Infantry Division did a bang-up job there 6 days ago, and it's quite a sight to behold. \n\nTake-off, do a circuit down the beach, and return. Our Avgas supply is short...you only have enough fuel for about 30 minutes of flying time, but  that should be more than enough. You will notice that the traffic pattern is extremely busy with all the troops and supplies being ferried in...keep an eye out for other traffic and LISTEN to the tower! Also on your jaunt down the beach, be VERY careful to stay above the barrage balloons . The 479th had a pilot wrestle with a balloon cable two days ago....the cable won.\n\nAlso, be advised, G-2 reports sporadic Luftwaffe sorties over the invasion beaches. If you see any flak, chances are it's a Kraut airplane. I know you're new to this playground, but if you see any German's over the beach, plaster them! Oh, and TRY not to put any scratches on those new Lightnings!\n\n\nCol. Cy Wilson\nActing C/O \n55th Fighter Sqdrn\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n
