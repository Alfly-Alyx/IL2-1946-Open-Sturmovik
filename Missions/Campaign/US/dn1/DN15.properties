Short Fly a few missions "TDY" (temporary duty) with RAF 30th Squadron.\n
Description \n*** TDY #1 ***\n\n----------\n\n\n11 AUG 1944\n\n0630 hrs.\n\nB04 RAF Airfield\n\nWX: CAVOK, wnd: light and variable, Temp: +16C, Altimeter: 30.11\n\nTarget: Fighter Sweep\nGrnd Threat: AAA and flak vicinity of German airfields\nAirborne threat: JG 26 and JG54 FW190, Bf 109\n\n----------------------------\n\nAn early good morning gentlemen,\n\nThis morning we fly a routine fighter sweep just south of Le Harve. It will be normal ops with one rather large exception. The Yanks have decided to loan one of their premier Lightning pilots to accompany us for a few days. It seems that his unit will be transitioning to the new Mustangs soon, and 8th Air Force wanted him to get back into the single-engine mindset.\n\nWelcome Colonel, stand up and take a bow...\n\nO.K., enough of that silliness. RAF intelligence has reported that our old nemisis, JG26 and JG54 have moved back into the area. For some of you new chaps, these bastards have been a thorn in our side since back in 1940, and quite frankly, I'm getting a bit bored with the buggers.\n\nLet's fly a smart patrol this morning gentlemen, and if we run into any Jerries, let's show the Yank how we deal with them.\n\nGood luck,\n\nPilot Officer J.H. "Jimmy" Whalen\n30th Squadron\nRoyal Air Force\n\n\n\n
