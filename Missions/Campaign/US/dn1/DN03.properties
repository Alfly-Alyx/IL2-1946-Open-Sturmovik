Description \n*** Moving Day ***\n\n----------\n\n\n04 JUL 1944\n\n1805 hrs\n\nValognes Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: 3000' SCT, Temp: +14C, Wnd: 300/10G20, Altimeter: 29.89\n\nTarget: None\nGround Threats: None\nAir Threats: None anticipated\n\n------------------------------------------------\n\nGood evening gentlemen, and a happy Fourth of July!\n\nWell, the weather finally broke, and not a moment too soon. I know you're as tired of all the damned rain as I am...and I can guarantee you that the dogfaces are sick of it. As you may have heard, yesterday the 1st Armored Division started a big push southward. The rain made the going tough, but the krauts made it a lot tougher. They're making headway, but without our help it's been slow going. With good weather forecasted for the next several days, we intend to get back in the fight. Starting tomorrow morning, we'll be busy as hell.\n\nThe big news of course, is that we're moving. Two reasons for the move: 1) Valognes has gotten WAY too busy for us with all the gooney birds coming and going, and 2) 8th Air Force feels it's time to get us farther east and set up shop at a place exclusively for us fighter types. Things are heating up around Caen, and Monty and the RAF will probably be needing our help. Colonel Rau has found a little slice of paradise for us that some rear eschelon type has imaginatively named "A12". It's roughly five miles east of Isigny, and should suit us nicely. We'll be sharing it with a couple of other units, but it's big enough for us all.\n\nSo this will be a "milk run". You'll depart and head directly over to A12 to land just before sunset. Col. Rau says you can't miss A12 because there's a big abandoned shoe factory a few miles south/southeast of runway 30. Also, the tower boys over there are saying they'll have the runway lights on so it'll be pretty easy to spot, and if you have enough fuel left, you're cleared to buzz the field to look over your new home....\n\nWait....hang on a second....\n\nO.K.....I've just been handed this. It seems the French Resistance has gotten word that some brass from the Panzer Lehr Division will be leaving the town of Periers headed for St.-Lo just before dark. As we know, the krauts have gotten wise in the last few months and only move their road traffic at night...but for whatever reason, these guys are going to try and beat the darkness to St.-Lo. \n\nSo, we've got a little change of plans here, and from what I can see, this comes all the way from General Eaker himself. You are to take-off ASAP, proceed to Periers and patrol the road from there to St.-Lo. If you see any kraut road traffic...CLOBBER IT! You shouldn't see any air activity, but you'll be behind German lines, so keep your eyes peeled. The 479th got the same message, so you might see a Jug or two down around St.-Lo.\n\nWe'll get you loaded with as much air to ground ordnance as we can in the next few minutes, but just get down there and find that kraut brass. The fuel shortages we've had here at Valognes since day-one will be a thing of the past when we get to A12, but for now, you'll be getting about an hour of gas each. Oh, and when you land at A12, our ramp is on the southeast corner of the field.\n\nGet going....good luck and good hunting.\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P.
