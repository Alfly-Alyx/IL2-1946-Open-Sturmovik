Description \n*** Mustang Mauler ***\n\n----------\n\n\n20 September 1944\n\n1530 Hrs\n\nArgentan Army Airfield\n\nWX: 4500' SCT, Temp: +19C, Wind: Lt and Variable, Altitmeter 30.11\n\nTarget: German aircraft\nGround threats: Flak and AAA in vicinity of St. Martin Airfield\nAirborne threats: Possible Bf 109s of II/JG3.\n\n------------------------------\n\nGood afternoon gentlemen,\n\nYour mission is to head up to the St. Martin Airfield outside of Bernay and see what the Krauts put in the air. You'll have some Jugs with you from the 338th to work over the flak and AAA around the field itself.\n\nSome of you may have heard that there's a big fight brewing up in Holland. The rumors are true. A week ago Montgomery's 1st Airborne Brigade, the "Red Devils", mixed with our own boys from the 82nd and 101st jumped into Holland to secure some bridges. The scuttlebutt is if this works, we'll be in Berlin by Christmas and home for the New Year!\n\nEither way, this will be your last sortie out of Argentan. We'll be moving up into a pretty quiet sector of Belgium soon.  Intelligence has it that the Krauts have nothing but old men and boys manning the Siegfried Line up there. It should be a nice change of intensity for us.\n\nLet's pray their right, and let's pray for Monty's success.\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed.\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n
