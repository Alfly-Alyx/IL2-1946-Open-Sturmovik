Description \n*** Swift Surveyor ***\n\n----------\n\n24 JUL 1944\n\n0900hrs\n\nA12 Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: 800 BKN 1000 OVC, Visibility: 2 miles in thunderstorms and rain showers, Wind: 270/20G37, Altimeter 29.77\n\nTarget: recon armor\nGround threats: AAA and 88mm Flak\nAirborne threats: none anticipated\n\n------------------------------\n\nGood morning Colonel,\n\nI'm not going to sugar-coat it for you, you've drawn a real doozy on this one.\n\nYou are to recon the areas southwest and southeast of St.-Lo looking for kraut armor. The Panzer Lehr Division is down there somewhere and General Bradley wants it found. Something very big is up, and the krauts must be able to smell it. Reports are that they're moving lots of armor into position in and around St.-Lo to block whatever we have in mind. We've got to find them before we can hammer them with the Forts and Liberators, but this stinking weather is making it damn near impossible to do that.\n\nYou'll be flying the recon bird.... lucky ship number 13. As you know, the only thing you can shoot from that thing is the camera, so there's no use even thinking you can kill anything. Expect a less than peachy greeting from the kraut AAA and flak; they'll have lots of it down there, just don't let them get a clear shot at you. Stay low, under 500' if at all times, and keep going fast...and I mean fast. Open those radiators and throttles and leave 'em open...we'd rather replace a couple of engines than lose you and the airplane. From what we've seen from them lately, look for them to be parked in groves of trees, and unfortunately, where you see the AAA coming from....they're getting nastier by the day in that respect.\n\nAbout the weather. I know it stinks, but the Metro boys are saying it's going to break late tonight. To put it simply, we just don't have that long to wait. Watch that take-off, those winds were clocked at almost 40kts last hour directly from the west. Metro says to expect lower visibility in the showers and also to expect light to moderate turbulence below 1000' AGL. When you make it back here, be sure and land on runway 30 and NOT on runway 12. Remember, all you have to do is find the abandoned shoe factory about three miles S.E. of here, then fly a heading of about 300 degrees....you can't miss ol' A12 if you do that. Just be sure and be configured for landing BEFORE you pass over the factory. The boys in the 1st Infantry Division said that they'll light a bunch of fires around the old factory to help you home in on it.\n\nWe've got Goony-birds in here that got their navigation all FUBAR last night in the low clouds and the fog, we got wayward Jugs in from England, hell, we even got some RAF Blenheims in here that got low on fuel. Let's keep our nav skills razor sharp this morning sir....we don't need you getting lost. After you land, taxi to the southeast ramp and park next to the radio truck in the middle of the parking area. I'll be there to meet you and get that film over to G-2 ASAP.\n\nAnyway, if you pull this one off, they'll for sure give you an Air Medal and probably a week of R & R in London...me, I'd settle for the week in London, and they can keep their damned medals.\n\nGood luck young man, and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
