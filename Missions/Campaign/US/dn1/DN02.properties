Description \n*** Hold Carentan! ***\n\n----------\n\n\n13 JUN 1944\n\n0415 hrs\n\nValognes Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: CAVOK, Temp: +12 C, Wnd: light and variable, Altimeter: 30.10\n\nTarget: German armor\nGround Threats: possible AAA and 88mm\nAir Threats: none anticipated\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nA very early good morning gentlemen,\n\nFirst the good news...\n\nAs you've probably heard, the 4th Infantry Division at Utah finally linked up with the 29th and the Big Red One at Omaha Beach. We now control all of our assigned sections of the Normandy coast. The dogfaces are doing a swell job, but it's time they get their butts moving inland.\n\nNow the bad news...\n\nYesterday, units of the 101st Airborne and the 327th Glider Infantry Regiment attacked the town of Carentan. The 327th pulled out and headed for Rouxeville, where it ran into a Kraut hornet's nest that had units of the 29th surrounded. They proceeded to kick some German butt, link up with the 29th, and now the area around Rouxeville is secure. But that still leaves Carentan as a big question mark.\n\nWhether you give a rat's ass or not, that little town is the lynch-pin for the entire Cotentin Peninsula, and both Rommel and Ike know it. Monty has kept most of the Kraut armor busy around Caen, but we can't count on Rommel to NOT do his damndest to get his tanks into the fight in our neck of the woods.\n\nThe 101st boys have been holding Carentan against probing attacks by what we believe to be the 17th SS Panzer Division supported by the 6th Fallschirmjager Corps. G-2 feels that this morning will be the big push by the Krauts...and that's where we come into the picture.\n\nI know you've been flying mainly escort missions for the last few months, and we'll see more of that...but today you're going "tank hunting". You'll take-off, get your birds down to Carentan ASAP, and kill every last piece of Kraut armor you can find. Those 101st boys have a few anti-tank guns left by the glider troops, but until 2nd Armored gets their Shermans into the fray, it'll be like throwin' spitwads at those panzers. If we don't "even the odds", those airborne boys are gonna get chewed up good....and we can't let that happen. Expect some help from Jug flights inbound from England...you won't be down there alone.\n\nI'm afraid the news on the logistics front is still bad. Along with all the other shortages, our aviation fuel is still in VERY short supply. You'll be departing with FAR LESS than full tanks, so watch those fuel gauges! The good news is that we have all the powdered milk and Spam you can stomach, AND enough bombs and rockets to turn our little section of France into a moonscape.\n\nGet going....good luck and good hunting!\n\nCol. Cy Wilson\nActing C/O\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n\n
