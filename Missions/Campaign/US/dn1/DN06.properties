Description \n*** Escort Service ***\n\n----------\n\n\n17 JUL 1944\n\n0730 hrs\n\nA12 Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: Clear, Temp: +22C, Wnd: 280/05, Altimeter 29.99\n\nTarget: Caen\nGround threats: Flak in target area\nAirborne threats: Fighters in target area\n\n------------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nTodays mission will feel like deja vu' from our old days back at King's Cliffe. For all you new guys, we were doing nothing more than playing "wet nurse" for the heavies back then, and today we're right back in that briar patch. \n\nMonty has been twiddling his thumbs for over a month now trying to wrestle Caen from the krauts. Yeah, I know, he was supposed to be in Caen just a few days after the D-Day landings, but that just didn't happen. I won't go into what's taken him so long, let's just say he's a "cautious sort of bloke".\n\nI don't know if you've been reading "Stars and Stripes" or not, but this will be his third go at it. He tried something called "Operation Epsom" in late June. The 1st and 12th Panzer, along with our old buddies from the Panzer Lehr Division, had different ideas, and gave his Canadians and British 11th Armored a rough time of it. He whipped up a plan called "Operation Churnwood" last week and chipped away some more from the krauts, but not without big losses. Well in a few hours, his boys are gonna hit them a third time with everything they got. It ain't gonna be easy, for lots of reasons. Allied "intel types" like myself, just found out that the krauts have thrown two more SS panzer divisons in.... they've even put in some damned "Luftwaffe field units"...whatever that might be...cooks, clerks, mechanics...hell, I don't know. \n\nAnyway, as you can tell, Rommel wants to keep Monty out of Caen, and the boys we're escorting this morning have hundreds of 500lb high explosive "wrinkles" to put in ol' Erwin's plans.  Their job is to bomb the hell out of those panzer units, and our task is to get them to the target and back in one piece. One word of caution, these bomber kids are just in from the States, and they might be a little jumpy. Lord knows our profiles in the -38 shouldn't be real hard to confuse, but just watch yourselves.\n\nAlso, we've had reports that JG53 is back in the neighborhood with their FWs, so keep your eyes peeled. Be careful out there. You new wingmen... STICK WITH YOUR LEADS, and for God's sake don't go off into some big dogfight and forget to protect those bombers!\n\nOh, and one last thing. The guys here in the tower say that those "cargo weenies" over at A5 just northwest of here keep complaining about our overflights when we launch off runway 30...they say we keep buzzing their field like we're "a bunch of cowboys". Just watch it when you depart this morning, for they're running a lot of sorties too, and the last thing we need is a mid-air collision.\n\nAnyway, good luck, good hunting and God's speed,\n\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
