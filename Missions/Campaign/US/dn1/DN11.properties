Description \n*** Close Air Support P.M. ***\n\n----------\n\n\n03 AUG 1944\n\n1145 hrs\n\nSt. Paul Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: 2500' SCT, Vis: 15nm, Temp: +20C,  Wnd: 010/05, Altimeter 29.98\n\nTarget: 116th and 12th SS Panzer\nGround threats: AAA in target area\nAirborne threats: none anticipated\n\n------------------------------\n\nGlad to see you all made it here, how do you like our new home?\n\nI hope your brief rest did you some good...we've still got a lot of flying left today.  2nd Armored is making a push across the river as we speak.\n\nAs some of you know, Capt. Blaisedale had the distinct good fortune to be chosen to be in on something new. He's riding with the Combat Command B element of the 2nd Armored as what we will call our "Foward Air Controller". This is new to all of us, but basically here's how it works; he'll be out there with the dogfaces, dodging bullets and talking to you on tactical freq 22. He'll let you know where the grunts need you most, and all you have to do is drop where he says to. Sound pretty simple, doesn't it?\n\nRight now, he's in the second wave of Shermans making a dash across the north Vire River Bridge. He's told us that the krauts have lots of anti-tank guns on the north edge of town, and he'll need those gone if this push across the river is to succeed. \n\nGet in the air, take out those anti-tank guns, and then kill anything else that has a black and white cross on it.\n\nOh, and just be damed glad you're not in Blaisedale's boots.\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed.\n\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
