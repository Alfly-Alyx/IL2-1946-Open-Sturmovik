Description \n*** Vengeance Is Mine! ***\n\n----------\n\n\n21 JUL 1944\n\n0755 hrs\n\nA12 Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: CAVOK,  Wnd: 180/15, Altimeter 29.88\n\nTarget: V1 sites\nGround threats: flak and AAA\nAirborne threats: unknown\n\n------------------------------\n\nAt ease gentlemen!\n\nGood morning,\n\nI know you'll find this hard to believe, but this crazy war has taken another odd-ball turn. I'm sure you've all heard of the so-called "vengeance weapons" that Hitler has been throwing at the Brits since the middle of last month. Well I guess he's been thinking that we're feeling left out, for it looks like he's started to send some our way. Yep, that big explosion you heard two nights ago just north of the field was confirmed to be none other than a certified kraut "Vergeltungswaffe-1" or V1...you''ve probably heard them called "buzz bombs". It didn't hurt anything other than a few cows, but I don't have to tell you how badly 8th Air Force wants them found and destroyed. After giving this thing a good look-see, we can now confirm that they aren't as accurate as we first thought, but they still pack a pretty big wallop.\n\nHere's what we know about them so far:\n\n-they launch from some sort of rail system.\n-we think they can reach speeds of around 400 mph.\n-they usually fly above 3000'.\n-their range is somewhere around 150 miles.\n-and most importantly, they pack about 2000lbs of high explosives in the warhead.\n\nYeah, I know....but the Brits have been having some pretty good success shooting them down with ack-ack, and the RAF has downed quite a few by.... now hear me through on this...nudging the wing of the little bastard with your own aircraft wing and sending it off course! I know.... I would rather just blast the thing with 20 mike mike, but I guess those Brits have some pretty big balls and don't mind getting close to the things. Just realize that in the -38, you're probably going to have to get above it and dive to match it's speed.\n\nAnyway, the goal here is to find the damn launchers and not have to worry about dealing with them when they're airborne. We have NO IDEA where these things are coming from, but French resistance has said they've seen lots of "suspicious" Kraut activity around the towns of Trouville and Pont  I'Eveque....I guess the SS has excecuted several locals for getting too curious.\n \nYou'll depart this morning, head toward those two suspected sites, recon for the launchers and if you find them, well....those 1000 pounders and HVARS will do the trick. Oh, and on the way, if you see a lot of allied AAA or flak, they're probably shooting at an airborne V1. If you can knock it down, then give it a go!\n\nThe bad news is that the weather guessers are saying that a front is moving in from over Wales, and starting tomorrow, the sunny skies will be a thing of the past for a while. Expect a windshift sometime this morning. The good news is that the Luftwaffe seems to have taken the forecast to heart, and they appear to be standing down for a few days. I don't suspect you'll see any fighter activity, but keep your eyes open nonetheless. \n\nOh, and I have some more good news. I was just told this morning that it seems Herr Rommel was strafed by some Spitfire boys a few days ago and ended up in the hospital with some sort of head injury. Poor bastard...shame they didn't just remove his head completely. Anyway....\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
