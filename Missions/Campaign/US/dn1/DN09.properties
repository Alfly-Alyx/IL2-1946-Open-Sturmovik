Description \n*** Escort Service II ***\n\n-----------\n\n\n25 JUL 1944\n\nA12 Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: CAVOK, Wind: 270/10, Altimeter 29.97\n\nTarget: Escort B-17s\nGround threats: AAA and 88mm Flak in the St.-Lo area.\nAirborne threats: unknown\n------------------------------\n\nGood morning Gentlemen,\n\nThis is it....General Bradley has started the big push to get us out of the hedgerows, and into the open country where we can get at the kraut armor. Yesterday, with the help of the 8th Air Force, the 1st Armored Divison kicked off Operation Cobra. It's a brand new tactic for us. We'll be using the Fortresses, B-24s and A-20s to bomb the hell out of the German ground units as they're massing to repel our attacks. Some desk-jockey in England termed it "saturation bombing", and well....that pretty much describes it. \n\nUnfortunately, yesterday it didn't work so well. I know you're thinking "who in their right mind would be bombing when it's so blasted cloudy?", but they tried it anyway with damned mixed results. The dogfaces took some short bombs, and it was pretty ugly....some are saying upwards of a couple a hundred casualties. Today, with the clear weather, they're going to hit them with over a thousand bombers, and our job will be to get them down there and back.\n\nThe recon flight a few days ago did a swell job of finding the krauts. We think it's the 12th SS and Panzer Lehr Divisions with their accompanying grenadiers. By the way, the Maintenance types told me that the recon ship was so full of holes, they're planning on stripping it and sending the rest back to the States to be used for beer cans. Also, there's a strong rumor that there'll be a DFC in store for the guy that brought it back with those pictures of the kraut armor.  He did one hellava job.\n\nAnyway, this should be a milk run. Get those bombers down to St.-Lo so they can pound the krauts, then make sure they get back headed over the channel. We really don't have any idea what the Luftwaffe is planning, but since we haven't seen much of them in the last few weeks, be prepared for anything.\n\nGood luck, good hunting, and Gods speed.\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
