Name *Double Nickel* Pt 1

Description Fly with the vaunted 55th Fighter Squadron, 20th Fighter Group, 8th Army Air Force. The famous "Double Nickel" squadron. Although the 55th did not necessarily participate in all of the following missions, they are all accurate as to event, date, location, and yes, even the weather conditions. Choose "Colonel" as your rank, for you will be leading all of the flights. GOOD LUCK! (reminder...uncheck "No Instant Success" in the Difficulty settings)
