Description \n*** Close Air Support A.M. ***\n\n-----------\n\n\n03 AUG 1944\n\n0430 hrs\n\nA12 Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: 2500' SCT, Temp: +17C, Wnd: 280/05, Altimeter 29.94\n\nTarget: 116th and 12th SS Panzer\nGround threats: AAA in target area\nAirborne threats: none anticipated\n\n------------------------------\n\nA very early good morning gentlemen,\n\nThis is going to be a VERY long day for us...and before it's over, you'll probably think it lasted a week. \n\nAs you know, Operation Cobra is going pretty well. General Bradley has had the 2nd Armored Division "Hell On Wheels" engaged for over a week now, and they're driving the krauts back in spades. They took Tessy-sur-Vire two days ago, and now we're going to be flying in support of operations around the town of Vire itself.\n\nWe expect this to be pretty big, and SHAEF see's von Kluge throwing a lot of armor and troops at this little fork in the road. Basically we'll take off, fly to Vire and kill anything on the east side of the river....pretty simple really. The dogfaces and tankers know we're coming, and they've been told to hold the west half of the town and NOT cross the river Vire until we soften things up first. Also, the 356th is going to have some Jugs down there with you, so KEEP YOUR HEADS ON A SWIVEL! I don't want any of you swapping paint with those P-47s.\n\nLastly, you're aware that the anticipated move south will happen today after your first sortie. Say goodbye to ol' A12 boys, this is the last time you'll lay eyes on her. After your mission you'll land at the St. Paul airfield and park on the north ramp where the gooney birds will be located. The C/O of the 30th Infantry Division says the airfield is secure, and we're going to take his word for it. You'll land and await further orders. Expect at least one more ground support mission this afternoon, and possibly two. We're going to stay in the air today for as long as it takes to drive the damn krauts back.\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed.\n\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
