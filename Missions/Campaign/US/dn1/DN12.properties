Description \n*** Mortain Defense ***\n\n----------\n\n\n07 AUG 1944\n\n1430 hrs\n\nSt. Paul Army Airfield\nWX: 1500' SCT, Vis: 15nm, Temp: +26C,  Wind: 280/15, Altimeter 29.80\n\nTarget: 1st and 2nd SS Panzers attacking Mortain\nGround threats: AAA in target area\nAirborne threats: none anticipated\n\n------------------------------\n\nGood afternoon gentlemen,\n\nWell, if you thought the krauts were whipped, then you're dead wrong.\n\nThis morning, at approximately 0100 hrs, lead elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Lehr Division, along with supporting units from the 1st SS "Liebstandarte Adolf Hitler", 116th Panzer and 17th SS panzergrenadier divisions launched a massive attack in our southern sector.\n\nThe objective seems to be to drive to Avranches, thus splitting the 1st Army to the north and Patton's 3rd Army to the south. At this time, the main German attack force has surrounded the small town of Mortain. This town sits on a vital crossroad junction, the krauts know it, and they're fighting like hell to take it.\n\nUnits of the 120th Infantry "Old Hickory" are holding the town, and the only thing between them and annihilation is their arty support. They're calling it down on the krauts like the devil, but they can't hold out for long.\n\nThe weather that had us grounded all morning, has finally broken, and it's up to us, and the Jugs of the 343rd, to get our asses down there ASAP and give them some help.\n\nConcentrate on the 2nd SS that's attacking from the south, the 343rd will hit the tanks on the north side of town.\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed.\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
