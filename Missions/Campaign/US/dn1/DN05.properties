Name 05 Lucky Strike
Short Let's pay them back for last week!\n
Description \n*** Lucky Strike ***\n\n----------\n\n\n12 JUL 1944\n\n0735 hrs.\n\nA12 Army Airfield, France\n\nWX: 2500' SCT, Temp; +20C, Wnd: 120/05, Altimeter 29.99\n\nTarget: Argentan Luftwaffe Base\nGround threats: AAA and flak around Argentan\nAirborne threats: aircraft in vicinity of Argentan\n\n------------------------------\n\nO.K. gentlemen...settle down,\n\nI know you're all still reeling from last weeks attack...we took quite a shalacking. Along with most of our fuel dump, those Kraut bastards took out plenty of hardware. We faired pretty well here at the 55th, but the boys over in the 479th lost over a dozen killed and half their airplanes destroyed. \n\nWell gentlemen, this morning, we're going to pay them back...and in spades!\n\nWe've received intelligence that the Luftwaffe base just southeast of Argentan is doing LOTS of training. Rumor has it that they may even be flying some of those new jets you've all heard about. \n\nHere's the skinny. You'll depart behind the Mustangs of the 56th, and link up with a flight of A20s inbound from England. Each flight will take a somewhat different course, but you'll all get to Argentan within minutes of each other. We chose to arrive there at approximately 0835 because the krauts are ALWAYS launching training flights just before 0900. If they're nothing else, those Germans are damn punctual.\n\nYour target is the control tower that sits on the south side of the runway....BLAST IT! When you're done, and if it's not too hot back over the airfield, circle back around and clobber anything that moves! Make no more than your initial pass, then maybe one more headed homeward, for it'll be a hornet's nest within a few minutes of our attack.\n\nMake your attacks and get your butts back here ASAP. I know I don't have to tell you, but more than half of your flying will be over German held territory. Stay as low as possible, avoid the flak, and if you go down, destroy anything of value and use what they taught you back at survival school at Kelly Field. If you're damaged, try to get back across the front before you bail out or belly land.\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nG-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Sqdron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
