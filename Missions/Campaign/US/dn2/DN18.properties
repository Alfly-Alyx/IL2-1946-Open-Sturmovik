Description \n*** Ardennes Sunrise Sweep ***\n\n----------\n\n\n22 SEP 1944\n\n0500 Hrs.\n\nSt. Vith Army Airfield, Belgium\n\nWX: CAVOK, Temp: +10C, Wnd: 300/05, Altimeter 30.05\n\nTarget: German aircraft\nGround threats: Flak and AAA in vicinity of German airfields.\nAirborne threats: Luftwaffe FW190 and Bf109 fighter units.\n\n-----------------------\n\nA very early good morning gentlemen,\n\nAs many of you know by now, Montgomery's big shindig to end the war by Christmas fell flat on it's ass. His "Operation Market Garden" was, in my opinion, too much to bite off at one time. Personally, I think the guy is over-rated, but that's for the historians to decide. In the end it looks like we'll be spending the next few months here in Belgium, and we'll have to get across the Rhine the old fashion way...one Purple Heart at a time.\n\nWe have some fairly good intelligence that the Krauts have just moved several squadrons of FWs and -109s in from the eastern front. Fly a sweep down the Our River and see what they throw up at you. Watch out for the flak and triple-A around their airfields, they've been giving the recon boys hell with it.\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nS-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th Fighter Group, 8th Army Air Force\n
