Description \n*** Berlin Boogie ***\n\n----------\n\n06 FEB 1945\n\n0945hrs\n\nY29 Airfield, Asch Belgium\n\nWx: CAVOK, Wnd: 100/10, Altimeter: 30.11\n\nTarget: Escort B-24s over Berlin\nGround threat: Flak over Berlin\nAirborne threat: FW190, Bf-109 and possible Me-262 fighters over Berlin\n\n-------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nI'm afraid you're in for another long day. I heard several of you griping yesterday almost WISHING for the "good ol' days" of killing Kraut armor. For you new guys, last December and January were no walk in the park. Hitler tried his damndest to push us back to Antwerp, and no matter what you hear from the old heads, those were long, hard days. Don't forget we lost a lot of good men pushing those bastards back. \n\nHere's the plan for today: \n\n15th Air Force is sending some Liberators up from Italy to pound Hitler and his gang right were they live...yep, the big "B"... Berlin. You'll rendesvous with the B24s over Mainz, they will feint heading for Hannover, then turn and hit Berlin from the northwest. You will escort them the entire day following the link-up over Mainz. \n\nThere's a twist though. They won't have enough fuel to return to Italy, so they'll be heading east to land at a captured airfield in Prussia. The twist is you'll be going with them! \n\nThat's right, another shuttle-bombing mission. Most of you have done this before, last September we saw "FRANTIC IV" work just fine. We'll this will be no different. It's called "FRANTIC VI", and it just means one hellava long day ahead of us. Just make sure you're all wearing those fancy "Dont Shoot! I'm An American!" armbands...\n\nO.K....settle down...\n\nSoldiers from General Zhukov's 1st Belorussian Front grabbed the airfield at Landsberg from the Wehrmacht just two days ago. They supposedly have it up and running, and that's where you and the bombers will be landing. It goes without saying, but even though they know we're coming, be ready for anything. \n\nOh, and don't....I repeat DON'T fire on anything sporting a big red star!\n\nThe plan is for you to be at the Landsberg airfield for two days, then you'll "shuttle" yourselves back this direction. As of this moment, we're not exactly sure where you'll land when you come back across our lines.\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed,\n\n\nCol. Harold Rau\nCommanding Officer \n55th Fighter Sqdrn\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
