Description \n*** Ardennes Bridge Busters ***\n\n----------\n\n18 DEC 1944\n\n0700 Hrs\n\nHotton Army Airfield, Belgium\n\nWX: 10 OVC, Vis 15nm, Rain, Temp: +03C,  WND: 240/10G20, Altimeter 29.80\n\nTarget: Bridges on the Our and Clerf rivers.\nGround threat: AAA and flak around spearhead units.\nAirborne threat: none anticipated\n\n---------------------------------\n\nGentlemen,\n\nLet me get you up to speed.\n\nThis thing is looking more and more like a major push by the Krauts. We don't know much, but we do know that it looks like four or five Wehrmacht and SS armies have attacked all along a broad front here in the Ardennes. The 106th got it's nose bloodied, the 28th is almost non-existant, and it's looking like this will get a whole lot worse before it gets any better.\n\nIt seems the Krauts are having a devil of a time getting their armor across the rivers. In this sector, the Our and Clerf are slowing them down, and if we can get down to Hosingen and take out as many bridges as we can, then MAYBE we can buy VII Corp enough time to rush in some re-enforcements and stop this thing from getting any worse.\n\nDrop those bridges!\n\nGood luck, good hunting, and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nS-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th Fighter Group, 8th Army Air Force\n
