Name 24 Bastogne's Bastards
Short Fly ahead of the C-47s and suppress the AAA and flak around Bastogne. Their re-supply mission MUST get through!\n
Description \n*** Bastogne's Bastards ***\n\n\n***************\n\nHitler's monumental gamble in the Ardennes would ulitmately center around an obscure market town of a few thousand people. His standing order of bypassing villages with his panzers, and using Grenadiers to mop up, would not suffice here. This vital junction was the confluence of seven roads that he MUST control to allow his juggernaut to move west. He gave Fifth Panzer Armee General Hasso von Mantueffel explicit orders to use his tanks to attack this town if he met heavy resistance. \n\nThe importance of this highway junction was not lost on Eisenhower and the allies. As early as the first 24 hours of the battle, he ordered the 10th Armored Division, and the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions to be ready to deploy to this area on a moments notice...early on the 18th, that notice came for the "Screaming Eagles" of the 101st. Within hours, a convoy of almost 400 vehicles had delivered the 11,000 men to a town whose name scarcely few of them had ever heard before. \n\nWithin days, the 2nd Panzer, the 116th Panzer, the crack 26th Volksgrenadier, and General Fritz Bayerlein's vaunted Panzer Lehr Division had completely encircled the city. On the 22nd, the  Americans were delivered an ultimatum calling for their surrender, or be destroyed. General Anthony C. McAuliffe, acting commander of the 101st, sent back his famous reply:\n\n"To the German Commander:\nNuts!\nThe American Commander"\n\nThis small town, located in a remote area of the Ardennes forests, would forever brand it's defenders with this proud moniker:\n\n"The battered bastards of Bastogne..."\n\n***************\n\n24 DEC 1944\n\n0800 hrs\n\nHotton Army Airfield, Belgium\n\nWX: 29 SCT, Vis: 20km, Temp: +10C, Wnd: 150/10, Altimeter: 29.99\n\nTarget: AAA and flak in the area of Bastogne\nGround threat: 20mm AAA and 88mm flak\nAirborner threat: unknown\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nI know it's colder than hell in here, but imagine being one of the dogfaces stuck in a foxhole. The "Metro" guys are saying that the current temp of plus 10 will probably be the high for today, but the good news is that the clear skies should hold for at least the next 24 hours. Watch those cylinder head temps this morning gentlemen, we don't need any engine changes in this weather.\n\nVII Corps has been planning to resupply Bastogne from the air for quite some time, and today is the first chance to actually do it. Our mission is to clear out as much of the flak and AAA down there as we can. Once the "goonies" are off the drop zones, escort them at least as far north as the river. After that, if you want to head back to Bastogne and clobber those Kraut tanks, I'm sure the paratroopers fighting them with just their M1s and bazookas wouldn't mind a bit.\n\nGood hunting, good luck and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nS-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th Fighter Group, 8th Army Air Force \n\n\n\n\n
