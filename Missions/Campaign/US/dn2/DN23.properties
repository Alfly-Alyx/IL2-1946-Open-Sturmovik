Short A spotter plane has found the panzer vanguard...go kill them.\n
Description \n*** Peiper's Gasoline Alley ***\n\n\n***************\n\nOf the many units that smashed into the Ardennes on the drizzly, foggy dawn of the 16th, none was more feared than the 1st SS Panzer Divison. Its 29-year-old fanatical leader, Lt. Col. Joachim Peiper, was fiercely loyal to the Fuhrer. His 5000 men and 120 tanks (including over 40 mammoth Royal Tigers) would be at the front of the vanguard of the entire attack. That vanguard would be SS Oberstgruppenfurhrer "Sepp" Deitrichs 6th Panzer Army.\n\nOne of the final directives that Hitler gave his commanders was to "show no human inhibitions" when dealing with the enemy.  These words were not wasted on Peiper's SS troopers, for they had spent the last many months on the Eastern Front... and brutality had become a way of life.  Before dawn on the 17th, his panzers rolled into the small town of Honsfeld to sporadic resistance.  When the fighting had stopped, over 200 American soldiers had been taken prisoner. As they were being marched eastward, a panzer crewman opened up on them with his cuppola mounted MG34...when the firing ceased, 19 prisoners were dead.\n\nAfter diverting into Bullingen to refuel his tanks with captured American fuel, a 1st SS Division sergeant came upon a half dozen prisoners. He ordered his men to shoot the American soldiers: they immediately obeyed. The butchering was to continue... When roughly 30 prisoners were herded together at the village square, they were lined up against a battered wall and summarily shot. Later, as 10 American infantrymen were marching into captivity, they were beckoned to approach an SS company commanders Kubelwagen. As they obediently neared his vehicle, he coldly borrowed his corporal's machine gun and cut them down.\n\nBy midday on the 18th, 1st SS Panzer Division troops were approaching Baugnez, a sleepy hamlet two and a half miles from Malmedy, Belgium. The roads were a confused mass of retreating Americans mixed with combat units attempting to re-deploy to slow the German onslaught. The 140 men of Battery B of the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion rolled into Baugnez at almost the exact moment that Peipers advanced guard of several half-tracks and panzers reached the crossroads. After a brief firefight, roughly 120 of the Americans were taken prisoner. They were searched and prodded into a pasture near the crossroads covered by a tank and three half-tracks parked in the adjacent field. Suddenly, the SS machine guns began firing, and several minutes later almost all of Battery B lay dead. A few SS officers and enlisted men walked among the victims administering a shot to the head if death was not apparent. \n\nThe 1st SS Panzer Divisions blood lust had reached a fever pitch. History would record this latest in a string of atrocities as "the Malmedy Massacre".\n\nWithin days, Peiper and his gasoline thirsty panzers would approach the massive fuel dump just outside of Stavelot. The station consisted of roughly 400,000 five-gallon "jerry cans" of petrol, and was vitally important for the entire offensive to continue. A group of retreating Americans would heroically deny them access to this badly needed fuel by siphoning off almost 125,000 gallons and igniting it in the path of the lead panzers. This stopped the advancing units, and caused massive delays. Within minutes, they would be spotted by a low flying observation plane, and the much-feared Allied air power would descend on his column dealing it a deadly blow. \n\nHe would ultimately be stopped by fuel starvation just ONE MILE from this fuel dump, thus reaching the 1st SS Panzer Divisions water mark in their attack westward. Three days later, his once strong unit would lay decimated by air power, artillery and Allied tank units. The commander of one of historys most feared units would find himself sneaking through the snowy night attempting to make his way back across the German border. He would recover a scant 800 of his original 5000 men.\n\n***************\n\n23 DEC 1944\n\n1145 Hrs\n\nHotton Army Airfield, Belgium\n\nWX: 30 BKN, Vis: Unlimited, Temp: -06C, Wnd: 180/05, Altimeter 30.10\n\n-----------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nThese have been a rough few days, but it looks like we're finally getting some good news. An L-5 "Grasshopper" pilot just east of Viesalm has spotted what he thinks is a major Kraut tank column. We believe they are headed for the big fuel dump located there, and we need to get in the air ASAP and keep them from getting that gas! CLOBBER THOSE BASTARDS!\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nS-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th Fighter Group, 8th Army Air Force\n\n
