Name 21 Wacht am Rhine
Short The Kraut armor is just a few miles east, get in the air and head west NOW!\n
Description \n*** Wacht am Rhine ***\n\n\n***************\n\nFollowing the failed assasination attempt in July of 1944, and after reading daily reports of the Wehrmacht's mounting losses (466,000 casualties in August alone...the once proud 2nd SS Panzer Division, originally 20,000 men and 238 tanks, had been reduced to 2600 men and ONE servicable tank), the Furher began to devise a plan borne of equal parts desperation and daring.\n\nHe stripped all the available manpower he could muster.  All men between the ages of 16 and 60 were declared eligible for military service.  All airman and sailors not in units with servicable equipment were transferred to the infantry. Most importantly, he ordered the Wehrmacht to transfer 90% of all personel assigned to administrative and logistical staffs...he referred to them as "rear area swine"... to a combat unit.  By doing this, he was able to field an amazing 25 new infantry divisions and 10 new panzer brigades, formed principally around the new medium Panther and heavy Tiger tanks. \n\nHis basic plan was to surprise the Allies with a devastating attack, send them reeling with the hopes that they would sue for a negotiated peace. He could then free up countless troops to head eastward to stem the tide of Stalin's juggernaut bearing down on him from that direction. But where to attack? Italy was out...the peninsula was too isolated. He knew two key facts; after breaking out of the Normandy battlefields, the Allies had stretched their supply lines dangerously thin (up to 350 miles at some points), and their newest port of Antwerp was just beginning to land much needed fuel, etc. He also knew that Lt. Gen. Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group had been badly bloodied in their fight for the city of Aachen, plus had suffered heavily (almost 30,000 casualties in less than 6 weeks) in the "meatgrinder" of the Hurtgen Forest. With this in mind, he chose the one place the Allies would least expect.\n\nAcross the central portion of the German "West Wall", lay the Schnee Eifel in Belgium. The American 12th Army Group was spread dangerously thin across it's 85 mile sector. Undoubtedly the  weakest link  was Maj. Gen. Troy Middleton's VII Corps situated smack in the middle. He fielded a lightly armed "cavalry" group, one armored division and four infantry divisions.  Of the four infantry units, the 28th and 4th had been badly mauled in the Hurtgen Forest and were in the Ardennes area to rest and recuperate. The remaining two divisions, were the newly arrived 99th and 106th, both of which had been in theatre just a few weeks.  In fact the 106th had been at the front a grand total of FIVE DAYS!\n\nPoised to strike into the Ardennes were four newly retrofitted and reformed German armies. The northern shoulder would be protected by Lt. Gen. Gunther Blumentritt's 15th Army, while the southern flank would find Lt. Gen. Erich Brandenberger's 7th Army on guard. In the center, Gen. Hasso von Manteuffel's 5th Panzer would drive across the Muese River toward Brussels destroying the Americans as they went.  The main effort, however,  would be  given to Hitler's favorite combat commander, SS Gen. Josef "Sepp" Dietrich. His 6th SS Panzers would smash across the northern sector of the Ardennes region in the area known as the Elsenborn Ridge, cross the Muese River and head directly toward Antwerp itself. \n\nTo add insult to injury, Hitler's best "commando" leader, Lt. Col. Otto Skorzeny, would take his "Panzer Brigade 150" across the front lines dressed in American uniforms, carrying G.I. dogtags and equipment, and driving captured American tanks and jeeps. He was to race and sieze several bridges across the Muese RIver, all the while creating havoc in the Allies rear areas.\n\nThus the scene was set for the beginning of one of the bloodiest battles on the Western Front. When the attack was officially declared over, the casualty figures would be appalling. Counting Allied and German losses together, roughly 180,000 young men would be listed as either killed, wounded or captured. Civilian material and human losses were no less horrific...\n\n***************\n\n17 DEC 1944\n\n1030 Hrs\n\nSt. Vith Army Airfield, Belgium\n\nWX: 10 OVC, Vis 5nm, Rain, Temp: +01C, WND: 290/10, Altimeter 29.88\n\nTarget: none.\nGround threat: Wehrmacht and SS armor attacking from the east.\nAirborne threat: none anticipated\n\n---------------------------------\n\nGentlemen,\n\nThings have gone to hell in a handbasket. \n\nMost of you know that early yesterday morning, Hitler's "old men and boys" came across the West Wall en masse. We're not sure what the situation is on the broad front, but just east of here, the Krauts are giving the 106th Infantry Division a BIG black eye. We have reports that their panzers are less than five miles from here, and we're not going to wait around to see if it's true.\n\nWe're bugging out! Get your asses over to the airfield just outside of Hotton, and await further orders. After you land, try and get some rest if you can.  It looks like this weather is going to stay like this indefinately.  I have a feeling that when it finally does lift, Ike is going to be looking to the Air Corps to pull his butt out of this mess.\n\nOh, and we've had reports of Kraut paratroopers dropping behind our lines. If you see anything with a cross on its wings, blow it out of the sky!\n\nGood luck, God's speed and I'll see you in Hotton,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P.
