Description \n*** St. Vith Saviors ***\n\n----------\n\n17 DEC 1944\n\n1530 Hrs\n\nHotton Army Airfield, Belgium\n\nWX: 30 OVC, Vis 15nm, Temp: +03C,  WND: 190/10G20, Altimeter 29.88\n\nTarget: German armor\nGround threat: Wehrmacht and SS armor attacking St. Vith.\nAirborne threat: none anticipated\n\n---------------------------------\n\nGentlemen,\n\nI know you just got here a couple of hours ago, but we have to get back in the air ASAP.\n\nThe bulk of the 106th Infantry Division is up to it's neck in Krauts east of St. Vith in the Schnee Eifel region, and the 7th Armored has raced down from the Aachen area to shore them up. We have reports that Combat Command B of the 7th Armored is engaged with Kraut tanks in and just east of St. Vith at our old airfield.\n\nGet fueled, armed and in the air as soon as you can. Find the panzers and knock them out!\n\nThe weather weenies are saying that the fast moving cold front coming in from Holland will bring us low clouds, fog, snow and record cold temps for the next several days. This will probably be our only sortie for a few days....make it count! \n\nGood luck, good hunting, and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nS-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th Fighter Group, 8th Army Air Force\n
