Description \n*** Sentimental Shuttle ***\n\n----------\n\n20 FEB 1945\n\n0730 Hrs.\n\nLandsberg Airbase in Russian held Germany\n\nWX: 20 BKN, Vis: 25 nm, Wnd: 090/15, Altimeter: 30.02\n\nTarget: Free hunt enroute to allied airbase\nGround threat: unknown\nAirborne threat: unknown\n\n---------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nFirst of all, let me say, I know it's been a HUGE delay getting us headed back west. All I can tell you is that the brass have been working their butts off to make it happen. We're aware that you're all frustrated and want back in the war. Here's the good news...today we head home!\n\nIt seems that our stay with the Russian hosts has not been as bad as some have led me to believe. I've been told their vodka reserves have taken a big dip since we arrrived, and we're still not sure how those female signal corp soldiers ended up drunk and joyriding in the Commisar's personal car...anyone?  I also understand that most of you have gotten a chance to sample their version of homemade vodka. My guess is that the two are related. Anyway, I'll have the Flight Surgeon give all of you a good look-see when we get back... just in case anyone show's a reaction to all this "hospitality".\n\nYour mission this morning is to relocate to a newly liberated airfield just south of Sperenberg. 3rd Army took it from the krauts last week, and it's been conducting flight ops for several days now. Be advised though, a counterattack from the Waffen SS is expected any day now, so be ready to possibly lend a hand when you arrive.\n\nYou will be loaded with air to ground ordnance, and you have a green light to kill any road or rail traffic enroute. Also, if you get the chance, give the Luftwaffe base at Fuerstenwalde a good going over. G2 thinks they have some of those Messerschmitt jets hidden there, and if we can knock some out, that would be a very, very good thing for our bomber cousins.\n\nGood luck, good hunting, and God's speed,\n\nCol. Harold Rau\nCommanding Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n
