Apparently the Luftwaffe had their way with them, something about high winds aloft screwing up the rendesvous with their escorts, anyway, now several are limping back headed our way.\n\nGet in the air, find the crippled B-17s and escort them to the Y29 Airfield.\n\nGood luck, and God's speed,\n\nLt.
