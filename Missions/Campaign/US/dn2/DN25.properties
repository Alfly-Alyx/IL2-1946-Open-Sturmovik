Name 25 Hermann's Hangover
Short Happy New Year! Welcome to 1945!\n
Description \n*** Hermann's Hangover ***\n\n\n*************\n\nLate in the fall of 1944, Reichsmarshall Hermann Goering began to entertain the idea of a massive attack by his beloved Luftwaffe against the Allied airfields of the western front. The fighter bombers of the RAF 2nd Tactical Air Force, coupled with the US 9th Air Force, were making life extremely hazardous for the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS units engaged against the Allied ground forces.\n\nEven though the month of December was anything but a success for the Luftwaffe in the west...535 pilots killed, missing or POW, with almost 200 more out of action due to wounds...Goering felt that it was rapidly becoming a case of "now or never" for his daring plan. On the last day of 1944, the code words were transmitted to the 10 Jagdeschwaden involved, and the dye was cast for "Operation Bodenplatte" (Baseplate).\n\nEarly on New Year's morning, 32 victory ace Guenther Specht led his pilots of sqdrns I, II and III of JG11 (mostly young greenhorns with less than 100 hours flying time), low over the German countryside toward their scheduled rendezvous point over Koblenz. Their target: the Allied airfield near Asch, Belgium known as "Y29".\n\nAt the same moment, Lt. Col. John C. Meyer (Deputy C/O of the 352nd Fighter Group) was taxiing his P-51D christened "Petie 3rd" for an early morning "local patrol" from Y29. Bad weather had grounded the Allies for the last several days, but he knew that the forecast was for clear skies with unlimited visibility. He had a strange feeling starting late in the day on New Year's Eve that the bloodied Luftwaffe might be planning something for what they knew would be a "slow" morning (read hungover) for the pilots and ground crews of the Allied airfields. He had phoned IX Tactical Air Force HQ late into the evening on the 31st asking, almost pleading with them, to allow this patrol in addition to their planned bomber escort mission scheduled for later in the day. They finally agreed, and he sent 12 of his pilots from the 487th Fighter Squadron to bed immediately. They had to be ready for the planned 0700 briefing...much to their chagrin.\n\nHis hunch was spot on.  As Lt. Col Meyer lifted off from Y29's runway, he found himself nose to nose with an incoming FW190 of JG11. He barely had time to turn on his guns, rake his nose toward the attacker and press the trigger....his first of two victories that morning crashed almost within the airfield boundry seconds later. Even though the field was under attack, all 12 of the 352nd's blue nosed P-51s made it into the air...the fight was on! Within minutes, they had destroyed 23 German aircraft, suffering only two P-51s damaged. Their actions that morning would earn them the Presidential Unit Citation.\n\nAs night fell on the first day of 1945, several hundred Allied aircraft lay damaged or completely destroyed by the surprise German attack. This "victory" by Herr Goering's Luftwaffe was not without tremendous cost... 271 fighters lost, including several at the hands of Wehrmacht AAA and flak gunners who mistakenly thought they were Allied aircraft. Over 230 German pilots were killed in the skies over the Allied airfields ...and this number included two dozen experienced formation leaders. A loss the Luftwaffe could ill afford.\n\nWithin weeks, the Allies had replaced the aircraft and crews lost from the raid. History would show that the once vaunted Luftwaffe would never recover from the losses they sustained during "Operation Bodenplatte".\n\n*************\n\n01 JAN 1945\n\n0700hrs\n\nEindhoven Army Airfield, Belgium\n\nWX: CAVOK, Temp: +02C, Wnd: 220/05, Altimeter: 30.07\n\nTarget: Wehrmacht armor\nGround Threat: AAA in vicinity of enemy ground units\nAirborne Threat: unknown\n\n-------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen...and HAPPY 1945!\n\nO.K. listen up....I know your heads are the size of Yankee Stadium right now, but shake it off, have some more "Joe", and pay attention. The lousy weather finally broke late last night, and the brass want us back in the air and killing Krauts as soon as possible.\n\nTake off, and fly a local patrol just south of Manhay. We've been getting reports of retreating Kraut armor all along the front, so find it, and kill it. The Luftwaffe's been pretty quiet lately, G-2 thinks they're just about out of aviation fuel, so anything you see from them today will probably be few and far between. \n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed,\n\nLt.
