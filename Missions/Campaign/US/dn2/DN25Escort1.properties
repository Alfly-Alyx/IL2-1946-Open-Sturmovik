Description \n(note: mission will begin and end in the air. When you get the "Primary Target Complete" message...you can end the mission at any time)\n\n\n*** Frankfurt Fanatic ***\n\n\n----------\n\n26 SEP 1944\n\n0945hrs\n\nSt. Vith Army Airfield, St. Vith, Belgium\n\nWx: CAVOK, Wnd: 100/10, Altimeter: 30.11\n\nTarget: Escort B-17s over Frankfurt\nGround threat: Flak over Frankfurt\nAirborne threat: Lufwaffe fighters enroute to target\n-------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\n8th Air Force has another long day scheduled for your enjoyment.\n\nHeavies will be hitting the tank factories just outside of Frankfurt, and you'll get them there and back. We have no idea how bad the air opposition will be, but we do know that the flak will be pretty thick.\n\nA few items to mention to those of you that haven't drawn escort duty in a while: \n\n-First... If you haven't been above 10,000' in quite a while, so give those regulators and O2 masks a good preflight before you get going...I don't want to see half of you scrub because you forgot to check your oxygen systems properly.\n\n-Second...since you haven't been mixing it up at 25,000' lately, don't forget to GO EASY ON THE CONTROLS up there. You aren't in that thick air down at 5000', and flying that thing "hamfisted" will get you into trouble in a heartbeat. No yanking and banking....stay smooth and stay coordinated.\n\n-Third... try to hang on to those drop tanks as long as you can...you're going to need ALL the 100 Octane you can get before the day is over.\n\n-Finally, and most importantly...don't let those fighters drag you down low into some prolonged dogfight, your job is to STAY WITH THE BOMBERS! While you're off baggin the next swaztika to paint on your fuselage, ol' Jerry is upstairs clobbering the heavies. Stay with them... there'll be plenty of opportunity to run those kill scores up later.\n\n\nGood luck, good hunting and God's speed,\n\n\nCol. Harold Rau\nCommanding Officer \n55th Fighter Sqdrn\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
