Short Attack the Falkensee Airbase again.\n
Description \n*** Allied Anthem ***\n\n----------\n\n25 APR 1945\n\n1130 Hrs.\n\nCaptured Luftwaffe airbase, Sperenberg, Germany\n\nWX: CLR, Vis: 25 nm, Wnd: 250/10, Altimeter: 30.12\n\nTarget: Luftwaffe airbase north of Falkensee\nGround threat: AAA and flak around target\nAirborne threat: unknown\n\n---------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nO.K., I know you've heard the news, but just settle your asses down and get your minds back in the game. \n\nIt's true, the Russians have completely circled Berlin, and they're just about to tighten the noose around Herr Hitler and his gang of thugs for keeps. We also have word that Wehrmacht troops are starting to surrender en masse to us in the south and to the Brits in the west. Apparently, they'd rather spend time in a US or British POW camp, then one run by our cousins from the East. I guess maybe I don't blame them.\n\nAnyway, this could be our swan song here gentlemen, so pay attention. \n\nOur last trip up to Falkensee was a little less than spectacular in terms of ruining the airfield. As you are painfully aware, after those Luftwaffe bastards jumped us we didn't get a chance to do much strafing. This morning looks to be different. We don't expect any air opposition, so head up there and put some holes into anything you see on or around that airfield. \n\nOh, and you'll probably see A LOT of russian ground units duking it out with what's left of the panzer units in and around Berlin. STAY OUT OF THAT FIGHT! Let Zhukov and his T-34s and IL-2s do the clobbering. My guess is that they'll level the whole damn city before they stop the killing.\n\nAnd I'll say it again, don't do anything stupid! As I said a few minutes ago, this could be IT in terms of a shooting war for us.\n\nGood luck, good hunting, and God's speed,\n\n\nCol. Harold Rau\nCommanding Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n
