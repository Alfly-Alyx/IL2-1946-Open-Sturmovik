Description \n*** Ardennes Express ***\n\n----------\n\n29 OCT 1944\n\n0830 Hrs\n\nSt. Vith Army Airfield, Belguim\n\nWX: 30 BKN, Vis 10nm, Temp: +08C, WND: 290/10, Altimeter 29.88\n\nTarget: German rail traffic in and around the town of Hosingen.\nGround threat: AAA and flak around targets\nAirborne threat: none anticipated\n\n---------------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nToday, you're going railroad busting.\n\nBased on the Luftwaffe attack here last week, and some information gathered from some Kraut P.O.W.s, a couple of jokers over at SHAEF G-2 think the Germans might be massing for an attack along this sector. Common sense says otherwise, all the real fighting has been up north in the Hurtgen area, hell we've even taken the city of Aachen. In my opinion, the Kraut infantry doesn't have enough fight left in them to defend their own cities, much less switch over to the offensive.\n\nAnyway...we're not sure exactly what they're up to, but whatever it is we don't want any of it to spill this way. Head down into Luxemburg...we've had reports that there's been some heavy rail traffic around Hosingen. If you find any trains...ruin them.\n\nOh, and Colonel, looks like a couple more days maintenance on your Mustang. I'm guessing being back in the ol' Lightning isn't quite so bad...is it? Kind of like putting on an old shoe.\n\nGood luck this morning, good hunting, and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nS-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th Fighter Group, 8th Army Air Force\n
