Description \n*** Ardennes Shutterbug ***\n\n----------\n\n12 DEC 1944\n\n0530 Hrs\n\nSt. Vith Army Airfield, Belgium\n\nWX: 500 OVC, Temp: +04C, WND: 290 15G20, Altimeter 29.73\n\nTarget: Recon German airfields east of the Our River\nGround threat: AAA and flak over airfields\nAirborne threat: unknown\n---------------------------------\n\nGood morning Colonel,\n\nThis one is right out of the Looney Tunes playbook. Some knucklehead over at 1st  ARMY G-2 is convinced that the Krauts are up to something. He says that local population intel, statistical analysis of the Nazi doctrine, coupled with his ability to predict what Von Rundstedt is up to, has led him to form a "hunch" that those bastards are planning something...and he's convinced it's big. Apparently this guy was right about some prediction he made in Normandy, so he has Ike's ear. This means we get orders to go see what's brewing down there. I personally think he's off his rocker, but we're gonna have you and Lt. Baker go get us some pictures. \n\nRational thinking is that if they ARE up to something, it'll show up in increased road, rail and especially air transport traffic just across the front lines. The weather is obviously damned nasty, so they just might be using it to move their supplies and attack units closer to the front.\n\nHead down to Ouren, Hosingen and Meinz, snap pictures of anything that's down there, and get your asses back here pronto. I know it goes without saying, but you two are totally unarmed out there. STAY LOW, STAY FAST and if you're jumped by anything, high-tail it back here and let our flak batteries deal with them. Colonel, you're our most experienced recon driver at the field, so Gen. Middleton up at 7th Corp HQ asked for you personally. Lt.  Baker, you stay right on the Colonel's six, and don't forget to work those camera shutters.\n\nOh and about the weather, when you get back here, the dogfaces with the 106th Division said they'll light some fires for you to navigate by. Fly over the fires, then take up a heading of about 340 and you should see the field. I'll be waiting for you in the radio truck parked on the northwest ramp. Oh, and I'll have a bottle of scotch with me.\n\nGood luck, good hunting, and God's speed,\n\nLt. Col. Mathew P. Cicero\nS-2 Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th Fighter Group, 8th Army Air Force\n
