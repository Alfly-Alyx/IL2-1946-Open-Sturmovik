Name Falkensee Funeral Pyre
Short Attack the Falkensee Airbase.\n
Description \n*** Falkensee Funeral Pyre ***\n\n----------\n\n10 APR 1945\n\n0830 Hrs.\n\nCaptured Luftwaffe airbase, Sperenberg, Germany\n\nWX: CLR, Vis: 25 nm, Wnd: light and variable, Altimeter: 30.02\n\nTarget: Luftwaffe airbase north of Falkensee\nGround threat: AAA and flak around target\nAirborne threat: unknown\n\n---------------------------\n\nGood morning gentlemen,\n\nBy all accounts, Herr Goering's Luftwaffe is just about kaput. To hasten that a bit, we'll be paying a little visit to one of his few remaining active airfields. \n\nThe base just north of Falkensee has been showing some activity lately, so let's get up there and kill anything that moves....on the ground or in the air. White Flight will provide top cover for the ground attack flights.\n\nWe all know that this thing looks like it might be winding down pretty soon. Rumors are ripe that the Krauts might even be sniffing around for some sort of "negotiated" peace. We know that ain't gonna happen, so we'll just have to see it through to the end. Whatever you do up there, just try not to do anything stupid. You've all come too far to wind up dead right at the end of all the shooting.\n\nOh, and 8th Air Force brass reported we had ANOTHER Mustang tangling with a Russian Yak over Berlin the other day. Just watch those triggers gentlemen, let's not have any international incidents. If you're not sure if it's a Kraut airplane or not, don't shoot 'till you figure it out, O.K.?\n\nGood luck, good hunting, and God's speed,\n\nCol. Harold Rau\nCommanding Officer\n55th Fighter Squadron\n20th FG, 8th Army Air Force\n
