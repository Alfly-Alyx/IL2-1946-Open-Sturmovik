Short Populated Normandy 2 map set for 1943.\n\n
Description 20th December 1943\n\nAt last, after a week of waiting for suitable weather we can try out our new rockets - you will join with a pair of RAF Typhoons in attacking shipping leaving Le Havre.\n\nGerman torpedo motor boats have been getting bolder and bolder - they are leaving port earlier every night to prowl the English Channel, the dark long nights are perfect for them to hit and run and be back home before first light, it's been very hard to hit these small boats with bombs and it takes a great deal of machine gun fire to disable them, and by that time they've riddled our planes with 20mm holes - so these boats should make a perfect target for rockets - one pass and its Davy Jones's locker for a few Nazis !\n\nThe RAF know these coasts well, so follow the typhoons to the targets, which we think will have just left port. Do not stray too close to Le Havre as this is very heavily defended, a PBY will be standing by if you guys have any problems.\n\nAs usual your aircraft must not fall into enemy hands, you know the drill by now, and i expect a detailed report on my desk before Christmas!\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nSkin - default\n\nReturn to base 45 mins\n\n\n\n
