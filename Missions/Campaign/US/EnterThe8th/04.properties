Name Enter the eigth - mission 4
Short A double raid today\n\nWhile the RAF attack shipping and dockyard facilities, you will escort B24s on a mission to Falaise.\n
Description 15 Oct 1942\n\nMorning Gentlemen\n\nAs you will be aware as you looked out of your windows when you woke up, the British winter weather is on the way, so this could be the last mission for a while, and for some of you a chance to take some R+R before a few of you are transfered to the 56th FG early next year- we'll miss you guys, but the Top Brass say the 56th need some ' old hands' to show'em the ropes. Anyway today -\n\nWe are flying a linked mission today with the RAF, they will be attacking targets in the Le Havre area with Boston bombers and Spitfire escorts. We will cross the French coast as they distract enemy fighters, and should give us a trouble free trip.\n\nP38s will provide the close escort, your squadron will do a sweep between the two targets, keep to your times and form up points and all should go well.\n\nFor those of you on your last mission for me, thank you for all you've done, and good luck in your new units - see you after the war!\n\nFor my last chat with you about Britain, lets talk about the people - The British are tough, don't be misled by the tendency to be soft spoken and polite.If they need to be, they can be plenty tough. Sixty thousand British men, women, and children have died under bombs, and yet the moral is unbreakable and high, you won't be able to tell the British much about 'taking it' . They are far more interested in getting together with us, so that we can all start dishing it out to Hitler.\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 50 mins\n
