Name mission 11 - Enter the 8th
Short Fighter Sweep + RAF bomb Falaise\n
Description 22nd May 1943\n\nWar news - there is still stunned amazement from the RAFs secret mission 5 days ago that totally destroyed 3 huge German dams, and flooded huge areas of the Ruhr, rumour has it that  crack suicide pilots in Lancaster bombers dropped special giant torpedoes that drilled straight through the dams causing them to break! This could mean the war being over in a year !\n\nGood to see the Germans taking the bait in our last escort mission, it's getting obvious that the deeper we fly into France, the more Gerry fighters will come out to play. It's also obvious that our P47s' can't dogfight with the nimble 109s' and FWs' , so old Hub Zemke  is giving orders that we must fly higher to make sure we always have the choice of when and who to target.\n\nIt seems that the latest German tactic is to use his 109s' to keep us busy while his heavy fighters attack our bombers unmolested, the new heavy fighter we came across is the Me410 which we assume is replacing the Me110, this new enemy packs a heavy punch forward and backward - as the many holes in our planes shows !\n\nToday we fly a high level sweep deep into France, the RAF are sending medium bombers to Falaise - to destroy oil storage depots, we hope to catch the enemy off guard as they try to intercept the British.\n\nTake off 10am, weather very good, as ever watch your fuel, and stay alert.\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to base 45 mins\n
