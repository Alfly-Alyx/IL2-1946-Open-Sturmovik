Short Escort B17s to Averanches\n
Description 6th June 1943\n\nWell you can all stop celebrating our victory in N.Africa, we've got a mission to fly. The rumours that we will be moving to Italy soon are way off mark, our job is to take the war direct to Hitler, we'll let the 15th Airforce chase Rommell up Italy, my guess is that Sardinia and Sicily will have to be taken first anyway.\n\nTodays mission is another long one - we will provide the withdrawal escort for B17s attacking Averanches, stores and equipment for German U-Boats are stored here near their bases, and destroying these will enable more of our merchant ships to get to England, and so build up our strength faster.\n\nP38s will ride shotgun until we arrive, and today we will stack you up to 30,000 Ft.\n\n Happy landings.\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 60 mins\n
