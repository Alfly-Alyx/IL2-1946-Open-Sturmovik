Short EnterThe8th \n\nThe 56th FG flies its 2nd bomber escort mission.\n
Description 16th May 1943\n\n Ok men its another bomber escort mission, this time we escort B24s to Argentan. As you all know, so far the 56th has the  least number of  ' kills' of the three  Fighter Groups in the 8th, so we gotta start upping our game or we'll be known as a hard luck outfit, we know we are getting better but there's along way to go.\n\nThis will be our longest mission to date, so fuel will be critical, we will escort in 3 stages - 62nd will lead, 61st will be close escort and 63rd the return leg.\n\nLets make this a success !\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 45 mins\n\n\n\n
