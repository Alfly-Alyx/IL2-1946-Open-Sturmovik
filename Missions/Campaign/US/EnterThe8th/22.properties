Name Bomber escort
Short Escort B17s\n
Description 27th September 1943\n\nOk, another escort mission today, we fly the outbound escort for B17s attacking installations at St Vith, at last engineers have sorted out our drop tanks, they've used the exhaust of the P47's instrument vacuum to pressurise the tanks so they can be used at high altitude and are more reliable. We should be able to stay airborne for up to 3 hours !\n\nMore good news on the war front, although things seem very slow in Italy and the Germans have control of Rome, the Italians could be on our side soon, and the Russians have recaptured Smolensk.\n\nCloser to home the 8th Airforce is getting ready to use a new fighter. I expect you have all heard the stories about the P51, some of you might know it as the Apache, the Brits call it the Mustang - great at low level but useless at altitude and an aircraft designed more for the British than us. Anyway somebody thought- what would happen if we put the engine from a Spitfire in the Mustang, and waddayaknow rumour has it its a winner! The Mustang is faster  than a P47 at all altitudes, and is as nimble as a Me109 and incredible as it sounds can fly to Berlin and back! As usual its SNAFU, the first Mustangs have gone to the Italian theatre, and the 8th will have to wait until the year is out to have enough to begin ops. I look forward to some of you doing some mock fights with the P51!\n\nBack to today, take off 1500, escort begins at 1600,\n\nGood luck, and watch your fuel!\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 50 mins\n
