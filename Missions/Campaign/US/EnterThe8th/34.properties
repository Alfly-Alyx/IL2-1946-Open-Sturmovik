Description 21st Feb 1944\n\nA great day for us yesterday 14 aircraft claimed shot down for the 56th !\n\nToday 'Big Week' continues - we escort the bombers to Dummer Lake again, then let the P51s and P38s take over. We caught the Germans unaware yesterday, so you can bet they will be ready today.\n\nStay clear of any large towns as the flak is becoming more of a menace than the Luftwaffe.\n\nwatch your fuel !\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nreturn to exit point in 60 mins\n
