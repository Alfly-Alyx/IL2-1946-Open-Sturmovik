Name mission 14
Short Airfield attack\n
Description 15th June 1943\n\nYou are waiting with your buddies for a lift into town for a drink and hope to meet that hot English girl in uniform that was looking over the base a couple of days ago, she must drink in one of the bars in town.... i mean pubs !....if i could just find out her name......just as the truck pulls up, the CO calls you over and wants a chat in his office..........\n\nThanks for dropping by tonight son, i know you're off into town for a few  warm British beers, but somethings come up - and as one of our seasoned vets i've volunteered your flight for a special mission, what i'm about to tell you is top secret understand? ..Good...\n\nOK, as you know every mission that 8th Bomber Command fly we lose some planes, and good men as well, many of our aircraft don't blow up or fall apart in the air, they crash land or even land, and it seems that the Germans have enough of our planes and spare parts from wrecks to get some of them airworthy again, and yes you've guessed it, their fighters can now practise and perfect attacking methods against these captured planes, and they may even try sending up B17s to join our own formations and attack us by surprise - which could result in mayhem.\n\nNow our topTop Brass somehow know the exact location of  these aircraft, it must be French spies, and they also know that the aircraft are leaving for Berlin tomorrow morning at 1015 !  You must stop them by attacking the airfield and destroying the 2 bombers, and the 2 fighters as well if possible. We cannot send in our bombers or the Germans will suspect we knew what was going on, so we will try and make this look like a fighter sweep that got lucky. Now i've told my boss that this is stupidity, as this may result in more of our aircraft being lost to destroy those that are already lost !!   But... this order has come from the top. You will be told your target tomorrow 7am, take off at 930am, cross the French coast at 10am, and you should arrive just before the American Luftwaffe takeoff and are out in the open. \n\nThe RAF will conduct attacks on other airfields, again to disguise our true target, and B24s' will be attacking St Lo as you return. Sorry to throw this curve ball at you, try and enjoy your night out, and remember walls have ears...not a word.........\n\nWhen you return from this mission you can look forward to 2 weeks leave and a move to our new base at Halesworth.\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 45 mins\n
