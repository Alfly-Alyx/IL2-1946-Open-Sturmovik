Short Aug 17 part 2\n
Description 17th August 1943 - part 2\n\nWell guys we've got some kills on the board on our first mission of today for no loss, but early indications are that we've lost lots of bombers as well.\n\nAs i said before, our afternoon mission is to pick up B17s homeward bound from attacking the Schweinfurt ball-bearing works, this is said to be well defended target, and the luftwaffe are sure to make a maximum effort to defend this vital war supply.\n\nP38s will provide the outward bound escort for this long range mission, and if you look close you might spot some of the new model B17Gs with a chin gun turret to deter head on attacks. Also as you know we are starting to display our new star 'n' bars markings, we should have all aircraft painted within the week!\n\nI expect the bombers to be heavily engaged by the time we arrive, which should give us the element of surprise, use it well and stick to diving attacks then regain altitude for another try,and remember to keep an eye on that fuel !\n\nHappy hunting fellas!\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 50 mins\n\n\n\n
