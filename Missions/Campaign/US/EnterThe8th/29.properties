Short Populated Normandy 2 map set for 1943.\n\n
Description 28th December 1943\n\nAfter a couple of weeks rest with a few Christmas parties thrown in for good measure, the weather has cleared enough to try the rockets again, the same 2 typhoon pilots have joined you again - this time to attack coastal flak positions, this could be a vital role soon, as everyone is whispering THE invasion must be coming!\n\nThe RAF pilots are good men and very keen, with a great attitude, and for a split second they remind you of home at the '56th', you promise them both a pint of beer tonight, at the Dog and Duck pub to celebrate the sinking of the Scharnhorst battleship off Norway a couple of days ago - the Royal Navy still rules the waves! \n\nThe CO goes through the mission yet again...\n\nAs before, follow the ' tiffies' to the coast and attack anything you see, silence any flak that fires on you.\n\nGood hunting.\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nSkin- default\n\nReturn to base 45 mins\n
