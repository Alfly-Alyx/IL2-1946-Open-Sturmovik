Description 13th December 1943\n\nYou did a good job with the bombing runs, but as you've rightly guessed, i don't think we will be recommending using fighters as level bombers to headquarters - problems with forming up and losing a fighters main strength- of speed and surprise, not to mention the bomber guys thinking we are taking over their job mean we will concentrate our developement on dive-bombing, straffing, rocket attacks and new tactics.\n\nWe are still not ready to test fly rocket attacks in an actual mission yet - there are various types of rocket in test with us and the Brits going on, we should get a joint mission in before Christmas, so to save you getting bored i've volunteered you to do a bit of liason work with the bombers - i've got you a ride on a B25 bombing mission, you will be able to try manning the guns and see things from the other side as the hunted not the hunter! It should give us valuable input into protecting our bombers, and help with fighter tactics.\n\nAnyway it will be a short mission to attack industrial targets in the Caen area, you will have plenty of time to write up a full report on your return.\n\nHave a relaxing trip, maybe take your camara up with you?\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nStart the engines of the B25, then press 'A' for autopilot, then press 'C' to cycle through gun positions- and mind you do not switch autopilot off by accident when changing views.\n\nSkin - default\n\n
