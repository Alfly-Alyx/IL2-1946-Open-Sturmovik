Description 24th Feb 1944\n\nIts been a great week for the Wolfpack with dozens of victories with hardly any loss, and the 61st has become the first squadron in the Eighth to be creditied with 100 enemy aircraft shot down. Zemke is calling the area around Dummer Lake the ' happy hunting ground'. The 'Mighty 8th' as we are being called can now put 700 fighters and 1000 bombers in the air !\n\nYou are on your way back from todays escort mission- the Germans have not come out to play today, the few 109s you did see darted away through the cloud, no doubt waiting for us P47s to turn for home before doing a hit and run on our bombers.\n\nBut if the Luftwaffe will not come up... we can go down...as you head for the coast, keep your eyes peeled for any German airbase that could do with a visit !\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nreach the exit point in 30 mins\n
