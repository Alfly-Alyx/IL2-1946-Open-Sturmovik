Description 20th March 1944\n\nThe raid to Berlin on the 6th March cost the 8th 69 bombers, the heaviest price we've paid yet, thats a lot of good men. But the missions continue and Berlin has been hit twice more, the Luftwaffe opposition is still strong but becoming patchy, and it's the P51 pilots that are striking up the big kills as the air battle moves out of our range.\n\nOur bright paint work has caused the other fighter groups to demand their own color schemes, so when Gen Doolittle visited the 56th last week we were told that our group nose color would be red, not to be outdone Zemke has told the ground crews to paint our squadron colors on the P47s' tails when they have time.\n\nTodays mission should be a milk-run, we will provide the final return escort for B17s attacking targets in Germany, once the Forts near the coast you are free to seek out ground targets to attack. I'm letting you lead the 56th today, keep everyone alert and make sure you know what each squadron is doing, you can expect RAF activity in the area so be sure of what you're shooting at, the Brits love any excuse to moan about the American Luftwaffe !\n\nI can't tell you any more about the rumours that we could be moving to another new base soon, or that learning to speak a little French could help in the near future!\n\nTake care of the 56th, and watch that flak !\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nReturn to base 50 mins\n\nthis is the last mission - thanks for playing !  \nLook out for part 2 sometime this year -\n\n' Zemkes Wolfpack -Boxted to Berlin 1944-45'\n
