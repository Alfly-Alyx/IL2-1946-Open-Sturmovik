Description 6th March 1944\n\nThe 'Big Week' is over and we must have dealt the German aircraft industry a huge blow, after days of bad weather its now time for the Big B - Berlin was attacked 2 days ago but the weather was poor and so were the results, today B17s go back to Berlin to strike at vital industrial targets - you can expect the Germans to throw everything at us.\n\nThe 56th will provide the return escort, so once again we set off for the 'Happy Hunting Ground' lets hope the Mustangs have left some aircraft for us to shoot down! Talking of Mustangs, the CO has said that we will stick with the Thunderbolt, its served us well and the mechanics know it inside-out, who needs the P51 with only 4 guns of which 3 usually jam in combat !\n\nHappy Hunt'n !\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nReturn to exit point in 50 mins\n
