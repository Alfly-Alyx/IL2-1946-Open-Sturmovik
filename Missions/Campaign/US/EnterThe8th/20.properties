Short Escort B24s  19th Aug\n
Description 19th August 1943\n\nOK as you all know the B17s took a heavy pounding the other day, 60 bombers were lost and that means hundreds of our boys will not be coming home, it seems the further we fly into europe the heavier the price we pay, the only consolation is that we are keeping enemy fighters away from the frontlines in Russia and the Med.\n\nToday we are looking for a bit of revenge - B24s will bomb airfields in the Frankfurt area, if we can destroy fighters on the ground they cannot shoot bombers down in the air!\n\nThe good news is that with all this action we have got some 'Ace' pilots in the 56th at last, so to celebrate Hub has approved a red lining for their flight jackets as a mark of distinction !\n\nAs usual we are pushing our range to the limit to pick up the bombers on their return flight as soon as possible, P38s will fly the outbound leg.\n\nTake off 1000, cross into Belgium at 1100, pick up bombers at 1110.\n\nWe must stop these bomber losses.\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 50 mins\n\nSkin - Blank 56th FG 61st FS Mid 1943\n
