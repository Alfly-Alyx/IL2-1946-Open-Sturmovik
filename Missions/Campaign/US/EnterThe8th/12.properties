Description 26th May 1943\n\nAt last we've got word that todays mission is go - the cloud cover over the target has cleared. The bombers are headed for Bernay - ammunition factories are still in operation with forced labour. The French underground will send a coded message to the workers to get out 15 minutes before the bombs drop, if no confirmation in recieved that the workers got out the target will change to St Martin airfield which is just outside the town.\n\nThe 61st will cover the outbound leg, 62nd over the target, and the 63rd the return leg. Our new photo-recon plane will follow up to see if the mission was a success.\n\nRemember - our job is to keep those bombers safe!\n\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 45 mins\n
