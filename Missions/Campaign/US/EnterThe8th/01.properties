Name Enter The Eighth !
Short August 1942\n\nThe 8th US ARMY AIRFORCE enters the battle for Europe, and starts daylight bomber missions to France.\n
Description August 1942. At last the 8th airforce has built up its numbers and trained its aircrew and is ready for the assault on the Nazis ! The CO of the 334th Fighter Squadron-4th Fighter Group of the 8th USAAF Fighter Command gives you all a pep talk before your first mission-\n\nAgainst the advice of the British RAF, we Yanks are going to bomb Germany into surrender in daylight raids, it is thought that the B17 Flying Fortress with its heavy defensive guns and box formations will see off any enemy fighters stupid enough to come near !\n\n Soon  new  fighters like the P38 and P47 will be able to escort our 'heavies'  over most of France for extra defence, and the RAF has promised its Fighters to cover our return journey.\n\nYou are part of this new era in the war, the 4th Fighter Group will now get into action , until production of our new fighters is increased, you will start your escort duties in the fantastic British Spitfire.\n\nAs you all know we have been working with the RAF to make sure our missions and targets are coordinated, and that we work as a team, and its just as important to get along when you are off duty as well. As we've all been working so hard since our arrival in Britain we have not had much chance to get to know the locals, so the War department in D.C have sent over a little booklet for you all, so you can understand the people and their customs.I will read you the intro -\n\n We are in Great Britain as part of an Allied offensive, to meet Hitler and beat him on his own ground. America and Britain are allies - Hitler knows that they are both powerful countries, tough and resourceful. He knows that they, with the other united nations mean his crushing defeat in the end. So it is only common sence to understand that the first duty Hitler will give his propaganda chiefs is to seperate us and spread distrust between us, if he can do that his chance of winning this war might return.\n\n So do not rub the Britisher the wrong way by telling him we won the last one - each nation did its share - Britain lost a million young men in WW1 - we lost 60,000, Nazi propaganda will ask the British people why they are fighting to save Uncle Shylock and his silver dollar, look,listen, and learn, and you will find the British are interested to hear all about America, so its our chance to overcome the picture many of them have of America - wild indians and gangsters! The British don't know how to make a good cup of coffee-we don't know how to make a good cup of tea, its an even swap! I will read you some more at the next breifing.\n\nWe have been training very hard for this day- our first escort mission.Todays mission is what the RAF call a 'Ramrod' - we will provide the escort for B17s attacking Caen. \n\nAs you've shown great promise, you will be one of my  flight leaders.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start mission\n\nskin - SPITFIRE UNMARKED-1 (markings on)\n\nReturn to base 45mins\n
