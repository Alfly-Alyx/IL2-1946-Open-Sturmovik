Name Enter the 8th - mission 3
Short The new P47s have been delivered, take one up for a test flight.\n
Description February 1943\n\nWelcome to the 56th Fighter Group, my name is Major Hubert Zemke, you come highly recommended from your old CO, as you know we are in need of some experienced pilots that have got some operational time under the belt, most of my men are straight out from the States.\n\nSince your last operational mission the war has taken a turn for the better- Montgomery has got Rommel on the run in Africa, the Germans still don't control all of Stalingrad, we are on the offensive against Japan, and we are getting ready to begin round-the-clock bombing of Germany.\n\nWell here they are, these are our new aeroplanes.\n\nThis is the Republic P47 Thunderbolt, bigger, faster,stronger,harder hitting, than any other fighter in the United States Army Airforce, I did say bigger right ?!  And yes I know it looks like huge bus compared to your old Spitfire.\n\nThe 56th has been a bit of a test unit for the P47, and we've been working closely with engineers from Republic to iron out as many gremlins as we can before we go operational.\n\nAlso i know that we will get a lotta stick from the British pilots - they are already joking that the P47 is sooo big, that if a Hun starts shootin' at us we can run up and down inside the plane to dodge the bullets! We've already lost 3 good men - spinning in from mock dogfights with Sptfires, so no fancy stuff below 8000 ft , thats an order.\n\nI am putting you in command of a flight in the 61st Fighter Squadron, your CO is Dave Schilling.\n\nOh well you better get out there and do a few take off and landings, if you can do three touch and goes without a wreck you are ready for some aerobatics.\n\nYou will have noticed their are many British women in uniform near our base, and it has given my unit much amusement that they are allowed to give orders to British men, well for your information the men obey smartly and know its no shame. British women have proven themselves in battle - staying at their posts near burning ammo dumps, pulling pilots from burning planes,and they have died at their gun posts, not a single record exists of any British women quitting her post or failing in her duty under fire. When you see a girl in Khaki or blue with a ribbon on her tunic - remember she didn't get it for knitting more socks than anyone else in Ipswich!\n\nI look forward to hearing your opinions on fighter tactics, and British girls in the officers club later!\n\nGlad to have you aboard.\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nDo 3 touch and go landings\n\nNo acrobatics below 8000ft\n\nSkin - Blank 56th FG 61st FS Early 1943\n\n\n\n\n
