Description 19th January 1944\n\nYesterday you were waiting for a transport plane to fly you to America, when the plane landed who gets out - its Hub Zemke- heading for Halesworth to takeover the 56th again, after a hearty handshake you both exchange news, Zemke had been flying a desk back in the States since you left, he realised that the powers that be were planning to keep him there, so he'd jumped on the first transport he could find back to Britain before any orders could catch him! The 56th had been getting some great publicity at home and everyone followed the latest news about  'Zemkes Wolfpack'.\n\nSoon you were sat in the transport....but not heading west..but... sat...next to Hub, next stop Halesworth!\n\nIt was great to be ' home' -lots of old faces, and morale sky high, you couldn't help notice the new faces as well, but nobody talked about that. You caught up on all the changes over the last couple of months - Group strength was now almost 100 fighters, so now missions often had an A group and B group, you've returned just in time to see who shoots down the 56ths 200th victory. Hub's return ment a reshuffle - 'Jimmy' Stewart will be your CO in the 61st, you get your old flight back, and 'Gabby' Gabreski will be Hub's deputy exec. The Mustangs are in action at last, and rumour has it every squadron will get them.Some of the top bomber crews are using British airborne radar for even better bombing in bad weather, and the famous General Doolittle is now in command of the 8th - he will not be asking us to attack Tokyo, but his orders are if it moves attack it - no matter what the odds !\n\nYou settle down in your old leather chair, a warm English beer in your hand, tomorrow its straight into action - 61st will provide the return escort for 'Forts' attacking Germany.\n\nWelcome Back !\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nSkin - Blank 56th FG 61st FS Late 1943\n\nReturn to base 50 mins\n
