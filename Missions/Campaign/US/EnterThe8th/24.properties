Short Populated Normandy 2 map set for 1943.\n\n
Description 28th November 1943\n\nAfter two weeks of country walks and visits into London you realised how much you needed a rest, even the bombs that are still hitting London at night do not wake you! At last you've been able to live a little and enjoy yourself - an 'ace' American fighter pilot with money is never short of companions, and the British saying of us being overpaid, oversexed, and over here could have been about you!\n\nNext stop was to find out how the paper war is won, an entire army of clerks is needed to file report after report, letter after letter, even at squadron level there is a form for everything - how many aircraft are airworthy, how many in repair, what spare parts are needed, is there enough ammo...fuel...oil.....food.....drink....paint.....uniforms.....tools.....pilots......engines.........No wonder the guys at the top are so keen to keep flying, they would rather face a dozen 109s than all that paper work !  \n\nSo you are very glad that after a few weeks of finding out how the system works, you are posted to the developement unit that tests new aircraft, new improvements, new weopens etc... this should be more fun!\n\nFirst day and straight into action, take up a brand new P51B Mustang to test against the latest Spitfire Mark 9, we want to know how they compare - climb rates, top speeds etc, as you know you can't trust what the manual says an aircraft can do! Keep on the tail of the Spitfire as close as you can, and do not stray too far over the Channel, we cannot lose any of these precious P51s !\n\nEnjoy your first flight with us!\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nSkin - HunHunter stars P51B   (markings off )\n\nReturn to base to complete mission\n\n\n
