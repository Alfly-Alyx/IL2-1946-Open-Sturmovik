Name Team Normandie Template No.3: 1943
Short Populated Normandy 2 map set for 1943.\n\n
Description 6th December 1943\n\nOk today we drop bombs for real, you will form up with a bomber flight to attack industrial targets at Houlgate on the French coast, this should be a milk run but we're giving you some top cover of P38s just in case.\n\nYou will be taking up the latest version of the P47, the dash 22- this has various small improvements, but most importantly underwing hard points for bombs or droptanks and soon rockets, we should have these latest models in squadrons by the end of this month, and they will replace losses and worn out airframes. We are also testing black and white identity markings on this aircraft to aid allied ground forces in avoiding shooting us down when we are attacking at low level !\n\nCircle the base until the bomber flight arrives and  remember to get in close to the left hand side of the lead B24, and once on the bomb run you can't take any avasive action against flak or fighters!\n\nOnce you have dropped your bombs you are free to return to base.\n\nGoodluck.\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nSkin - Default\n\n\n\n
