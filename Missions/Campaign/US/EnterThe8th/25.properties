Description 3rd December 1943\n\nGood job the other day bringing that P51 home, looks like it was a faulty fuel gauge that got you into trouble, still gave you some dead-stick landing practice!\n\nAs i'm sure you've guessed this unit has more than its fair share of drama, and danger, but the work we are doing sure helps the guys in the front line.\n\nToday you will be taking up your old P47 and carrying a 1000 pounder, someone has had the idea that a squadron of bomb carrying P47s forming up on a lead heavy bomber could then all release bombs on the leaders command, once the bombs are gone the fighters could then resume their normal role. The hope is that this will reduce bomber losses and give us more options in our attacks.\n\nForm up on the B24 bomber as close as you can, and release your bomb when they do. You must be as close as possible and have the same speed and altitude, or your bomb will not hit the B24s target.\n\nTake off 0700, and i will want a full written report on my desk by 1500.\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nSkin - Blank 56th FG 61st FS Late 1943\n\n\n\n\n\n
