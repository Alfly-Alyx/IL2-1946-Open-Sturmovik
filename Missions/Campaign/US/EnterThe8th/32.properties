Short Populated Normandy 2 map set for 1943.\n\n
Description 11th Feb 1944\n\nA period of bad weather has given you time to settle into the rountine of squadron life - endless talk of tactics, kills, weather, women, and what you'll all do after the war...\n\nThere was some excitment last week when Col Zemke ordered all the P47s have their noses painted, if the damn Nazis can use bright colors then so can the Wolfpack! So the 61st now have red noses, the 62nd yellow and 63rd blue, and most were painted in one night !\n\nAs the weather is too bad to attack Gemany, bombers will be striking aircraft facilities in France, once the bombers have past Bernay we hand over escort duties and look for an airfield to strafe, try not to do more than 2 ground attack runs, the flak will nail you on the third !\n\nOne of our flights has now got the latest model  D-22, which has various tweeks and improvements, so do not go out and get your ship shot up by flak thinking you'll get a brand new Tbolt, as usual in the army- its highest rank first.\n\nTake off 1030\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nReturn to base 50 mins\n\nSkin - Blank 56FG 61st FS 1944\n
