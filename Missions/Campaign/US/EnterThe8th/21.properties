Short Fighter sweep in france\n
Description 3rd September 1943\n\nGreat news - our armies have landed in Italy!  Montgomery and his Desert Rats are leading the way, our boys will be in Rome in no time, wow all those Italian dames, my head is spinning just thinking what a holiday the so called  'poor bloody infantry' will be having while we freeze our butts off at 25,000 ft !\n\nanyway we will be having an Italian feast tonight to celebrate, prepared by some of the guys of Italian descent, but first we've got a fighter sweep to do.\n\nThe weather is not good over Germany, so the bombers will have a well earned rest, a small force of medium bombers will attack oil storage facilities in Falaise in the hope of drawing enemy fighters up for us to pounce on.\n\nOne flight from each squadron will take part, takeoff 930.\n\nPasta or spaghetti tonite ?\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 45 mins\n
