Short Fly to new base\n
Description Great job on that last mission, everything went to plan for a change, and our T-bolts showed they can soak up punishment as well as dish it out!\n\nAs instructed, today is the day we take over our new temporary base at Halesworth in the county of Suffolk, i know that this is not a popular decision as we had settled in at Horsham and made a nice home for ourselves, but with the ever growing war effort it is needed for a new bomber base. Don't forget there is a war on - we may have only unfinished buildings and facilities, but we have it 100 times better than our infantry on the front line, and more importantly our new base is on the coast, and will give us valuable extra minutes over enemy territory.\n\nYour flight will be one of the last in, so watch out for traffic, as things are a hive of activity getting the place ready for ops.\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n
