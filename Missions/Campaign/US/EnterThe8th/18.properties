Short escort b17s\n
Description August 17th 1943\n\nOk we've had a couple of missions to get used to these drop tanks, and not a sniff of the enemy, the bomber groups are very happy that their little friends can stay with them longer and pick them up again sooner.Just remember if you get into a fight and your Jug feels funny and doesn't handle as well - you forgot to jettison your belly tank dummy !\n\nThe German fighters now know to wait until our fuel is low, and when we turn for home - thats when they attack our bombers, and our losses are becoming serious. The plan is with our extended range we will catch the square heads off guard and shoot them down in droves!\n\nToday's missions should bring us plenty of action, and some firsts - this morning we escort B17s to Regensburg Messerschmitt factory, but the B17s will not be coming home! They will carry on to N Africa on a shuttle mission, the planners hope that by only having to fly through the German defences once they should have far fewer losses and confuse the Germans as well !\n\nWe should back at base for a light lunch before we then provide the withdrawal escort for B17s attacking the Schweinfurt ball-bearing works.\n\nRemember to keep an eye on your fuel gauge when you cross into Belgium, you have about 45 minutes of  fuel, if your not back across the Belgium border by then you are swimming home.\n\nGoodluck.\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 45 mins\n\n\n\n
