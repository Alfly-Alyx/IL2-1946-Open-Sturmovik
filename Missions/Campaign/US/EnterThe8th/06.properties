Short EnterThe8th \n\n56th FGs first mission, a ' Rodeo' with the RAF\n
Description 8th April 1943\n\nGoodmorning Gentlemen of the 56th FG\n\nOur big day has come at last, we've been training very hard the last couple of weeks, and now we are ready for our first operational sortie.\n\nI know you have all put in a lot of effort into making our new base here at Horsham St Faith feel like home, but now the real work begins !\n\nFor our first mission, you guys of the 61st FS will fly a coastal sweep over France, the RAF call these sweeps a ' Rodeo' and hope to draw out enemy fighters to battle. RAF Spitfires will provide us with top cover.\n\n I know a couple of you have flown many of these missions in Spitfires with the 4th FG, so i'm counting on you to show us how its done.\n\nGoodluck.\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 45 mins\n\n
