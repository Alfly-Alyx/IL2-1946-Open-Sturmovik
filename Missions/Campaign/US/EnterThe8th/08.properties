Short EnterThe8th \n\nThe 56th FG conducts its first all American     ' Rodeo'\n
Description 15th April 1943\n\nRise and shine ladies, now that we can find our way to France and back without the RAF holding our hand, its time we flew our own ' Rodeos', today will be our first mission where all three squadrons fly together, so i want it by the book just as we practised.\n\nJust remember the things that will keep you alive - good teamwork , speed is life , once combat begins never fly in a straight line for more than 20 seconds, most pilots never see the enemy that shoots him down , so keep your eyes wide open.\n\nIf all else fails, listen to what the RAF fighter boys tell you down the pub- the P47 is so heavy that it out dive the devil, and get you out of harms way.\n\nGo for it 56th !\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to exit point 45 mins\n\n
