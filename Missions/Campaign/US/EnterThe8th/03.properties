Name Bomber Escort
Short Escort B17s on a mission to Orbec.\n
Description 4th Sept 1942\n\nOK Ladies listen up,\n\nThe Germans seem to be getting the hang of attacking the Fortresses, and after a few losses the bomber boys aren't as cocky , and are squeeling for more fighter cover.\n\nTodays chat about Britain - Remember there's a war on !  Britain may look shop-worn and grimy to you.The British are anxious to have you know that you are not seeing their country at its best. Remember there's been a war on since 1939, the houses haven't been painted because factories are not making paint-they're making planes. British taxicabs look antique because Britain is making tanks for herself and Russia-not new cars. The trains are unwashed and grimy because men and women are needed for more important work than washing. In normal times Britain looks much prettier,cleaner and neater.\n\nTarget for today is oil storage facilities at Orbec.\n\nMake sure the bombers are free to concentrate on the target, if they don't destroy the target they will have to go back another day, and you can bet the flak will be twice as thick !\n\nYou will fly top cover today, stay with the bombers.\n\ngive 'em hell.\n\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nAir start\n\nReturn to base 45mins\n\n
