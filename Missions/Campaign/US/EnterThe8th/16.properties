Short B24 Escort\n
Description 28th July 1943\n\nWell this will be the 10th mission from our new home, and hardly a sniff of the enemy - not that the bombers are complaining !\n\nI hope you all enjoyed the visit from Eddie Rickenbaker today-just what we need before a mission-lots of brass hats and a WW1 Ace!  Eddie was telling me about the thrill of flying at 130mph in his Spad, and his 28 victories, only 25 years later and look how fighters have changed! The planes might have changed but fighter rules have not - keep your eyes peeled, your head turning, don't follow a kill down, and beware the Hun in the sun !\n\ntodays mission will be to escort B17s' attacking war installations at Lisieux, this is short mission so the altitude will not be high, so be extra carefull not to stray over any large towns as the flak is getting worse every day.\n\nThe 61st and 62nd will take the outward leg, with the 63rd picking up the bombers homeward bound. Remember to stick to your flight paths and times, so that we maximise our effectiveness.\n\nLets hope we can gets some 'kills' today.\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nReturn to base 45 mins\n\n
