Name Enter The 8th- 2nd mission
Short Pick up the B17s' for the homeward leg of the mission, and escort them home.\n
Description 28th August.The new P38s' will look after the heavies outward bound, and over the target ( industrial buildings in St Lo ), we will pick them up when they turn for home, should be a milk run today guys, good weather and a short hop to the French coast, and back in time for a nite out !\n\nNext on my list is another talk about the country we are in - England is a small country, smaller than N. Carolina or Iowa, and the whole of Great Britain ( England,Scotland,Wales) is about the size of Minnesota. England's largest river, the Thames ( pronounced "Tems" ) is not even as big as the Mississippi when it leaves Minnesota.No part of England is more than 100 miles from the sea. If you are from Boston or Seattle the weather will remind you of home, if you're from Arizona or N Dakota you will find it hard. Most people get used to the English climate eventually !\n\nNews on the war is mixed - its still stalemate in N.Africa, the Brits and Canadians are still reeling from a very bloody nose from the large raid on Dieppe Port last week, and the Germans have reached Stalingrad, if Uncle Joe losses his own city it could be the end for Russia.\n\nYou have all had a good look at the new P38 Lightning fighter when one visited our base, it's a distinctive looking ship with heavy and concentrated firepower, it's the first of our new fighters and has a very good escort range, and the safety of two engines for long flights. Lets hope it can dogfight as well !\n\nTake off 1500\n\nKeep it tight, and pick up the heavies on time.\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nReturn to base 45 mins\n
