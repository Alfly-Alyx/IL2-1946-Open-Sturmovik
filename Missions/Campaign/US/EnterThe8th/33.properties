Description 20th Feb 1944\n\nAt last the weather has improved, its a clear cold day and the start of a planned big week of attacks on the German aircraft industry.\n\nThere is a grim determined look on everyone's face, London suffered last night, in the heaviest air raids for some time - 1000s of women and children reported dead and many more homeless, the British know all about danger and you feel a shared bond with everyone on this little island that stands for so much in the world.\n\nOnce again we will be flying to our limits of range, so keep an eye on the clock and fuel gauge, our outbound escorting finishes over Dummer Lake, north of Osnabruck, then the P51s will take over, on your way home look out for any targets of oportunity on the ground.\n\nLets make the most of this good weather.\n\n\n\n\n***PILOT NOTES***\n\nBack to the exit point in 60 mins\n\n\n
