Short \u0020mission to Germany\n
Description 22nd March 1943\n\nThe mission to Vegesack is being seen by the top brass as some sort of turning point in our daylight bombing campaign, we have been told that the target has been officially described as ' extremely heavily damaged' and despite heavy flak and many enemy fighter attacks, losses were small, and all the 303rd ships made it home bar one - HUNGA DUNGA which was lost to flak on the way home. \n\nOur General Eaker has been congratulated by the British Prime Minister Churchill, he says -\n\n" All my compliments to you and your officers and men on your brilliant exploit, the effectiveness of which photographs already reveal "\n\nBut for us down in the squadron it's just another mission to get through and survive, and every mission has some sort of tragedy, and the Vegesack raid dealt the 303rd a bad one, the 359th's THE DUCHESS an original 303rd Ship was  lead bomber, Jack Mathis the bombardier had been entertaining his brother Mark - who had just arrived in England and was training as a bombardier himself on B26s', Jack wanted a rest from the mission, to spend more time with his brother, but was asked to go on this important raid with the promise of a 3 day pass after.\n\nSeconds before bomb release the DUCHESS was hit in the nose by a shell which mortally injured Jack - the navigator in the nose compartment  was hit as well and dazed, he watched Jack crawl back to his bombsight and release the bombs bang on target before slumping dead at his station. The DUCHESS made it back home to Molesworth with Mark waiting to greet his brother...\n\nMark Mathis has now put in to transfer into the 303rd to take over as bombardier in his hero brother's ship and get his revenge on the Nazis.\n\nThe weather is improving and although the missions are getting tougher, our bombing is getting better, what's more the unofficial race to be the first B17 to reach 25 missions is hotting up, this will be my 20th mission today, but we know that the 359th's KNOCKOUT DROPPER is right there with us, and a ship from the 91st BG - the MEMPHIS BELLE is in the race as well, I hope we all make it to25.\n\nToday we go back to Wilhelmshaven, and with great visability predicted, we know the Germans will be up in force, again every servicable ship is sent up, 18 ' Forts' takeoff, 15 of us reach the enemy coast,\n\n" ok guys watch out for fighters..."\n\n \n \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n              *** FORMATION AIR START ***\n\n               *** SET THROTTLE AT 80% ***\n\nBomb Wilhelmshaven Port Area at sector X24 - see recon photo (static camera view)\n\nReach exit point at sector A28 to finish mission\n\n\n\n
