Name mission 17
Short Attack on Antwerp 4th May 1943\n
Description 4th May 1943\n\nA month has flown by with only 1 more mission flown by you, on the 5th of April we hit Antwerp in Belgium for no loss. Then you missed the next 3 raids -\n\nOn the 16th and 17th your trusty old HELL'S ANGELS needed some well earned R&R, with a couple of engine changes needed and a bit of an overhaul, and all this just as we are nearing the magic 25 missions!\n \nThe mission on the 17th was the biggest yet, with 115 Fortresses attacking Bremen, It was also the first mission for Mark Mathis - flying in his late brother's ship THE DUCHESS and sat at the exact same bombardier's position that Jack died at....\n\nNext mission for the Group was a few days ago on the 1st of May, back yet again to Flak City, St Nazaire, but due to the ever growing strength of our group, the 358th was rested, we lost 2 ships that day - BLACK SWAN and JOE BTFSPLK 2, if only our fighters had the range to cover us all the way to the target and back...we now have our own American P47 Thunderbolt fighters to escort us on the shorter missions, but these huge lumbering beasts seem nothing like the agile beautiful Spitfire or nimble German fighters, and we don't see how they are any improvement for us!\n\nToday we attack the General Motors and Ford Motors plants in Antwerp Belgium, does Uncle Sam know we are bombing our own companies?! Anyway if we can destroy these targets that's a load less trucks and vehicles for the Nazis.\n\nThere is also a buzz of excitement in the air as we prepare for takeoff, Captain Calhoun in THE '8' BALL MK2 leads us today with his extra crew member on board - one Capt Clark Gable, the Hollywood movie star, who is making a motion picture about our bombers in England! With good weather and RAF Spitfires and our own Thunderbolts to look after us, Capt Gable should get some great film - and for us a milkrun !\n\nAll too soon the RAF Spitfires are getting low on gas and turn for home, more RAF squadrons will meet us at the coast on the return leg, that leaves our rookie Thunderbolt pilots to look after us until then...\n\n....10 minutes to target....21 B17s in perfect formation scan the skies....\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n        *** FORMATION AIR START ***\n\n         *** SET THROTTLE TO 80% ***\n\nBomb motor works at sector C1, see recon map \n( static camera)\n\nExit map at sector A1 to complete mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n
