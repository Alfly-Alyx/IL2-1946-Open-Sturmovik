Name mission 22
Short Attack Amiens Aerodrome\n
Description 15th August 1943\n\nOur trip to Hamburg was another standard mission - good bombing through lots of smoke, over 200 enemy fighters stayed with our bomber stream for over an hour, and one 303rd ship lost, BUTCH from the 360th went down over the target.\n\nBlitz Week was a mixed success - our bombers always got through to the targets in Germany but losses are mounting, and the 8th Bomber Command's B17 numbers went from 350 at the start of Blitz Week to 200 serviceable ships by the end.\n\nOur 8th Army Airforce now has 13 B17 Groups and 3 P47 Groups, our 3 B24 Groups should return to England in September.\n\nAgain you sit out the next 4 long missions to targets in Germany, we lose 2 more ships - UPSTAIRS MAID from the 360th ditched in the Channel and again our crew were rescued. No such luck for OLD IRONSIDES from the 359th which went down in flames in the ' happy valley' as we call the Ruhr industrial area on the 12th.\n\nWe have a new leader in the 303rd as well - Col Kermit D Stevens has taken over from our beloved Col Marion, Stevens has already stamped his mark on the 303rd with his great pep talks, and he tell us -\n\n" You've got to get in there and really bow your necks! "\n\nWe attack the Amiens Aerodrome in France today, with our bomber losses growing it is felt now is a good time to destroy the Nazi fighters on the ground before they can start shooting at us!\n\nWith those sleek RAF Spitfires once again watching over us, it should be a milk-run for the 303rd's 58th mission...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBomb Amiens Aerodrome at sector K2   - see recon photo (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
