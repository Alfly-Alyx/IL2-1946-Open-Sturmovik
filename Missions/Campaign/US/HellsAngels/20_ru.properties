Name Mission 20
Short Attack Le Mans\n
Description 4th July 1943\n\nThe raid on the 26th went great, with no loss to the 303rd, and your trainee crew did a good job, the Gunship was a welcome edition but struggled to keep up with us after we'd dropped our bombs and turned for home.\n\nMissions on the 28th and 29th both went to targets in France, and again all our ships came home - in no small measure to the very good fighter cover from our P47s, which despite their size, seem able to take on the Germans and win.\n\nToday you will fly another mission, and have a chance to celebrate Independence day in fine style by destroying the Aircraft works at Le Mans France, even the local Brits are looking forward to drinking a warm beer with us tonight to toast their defeat to the  USA - hundreds of years later and we fight side by side as brothers against an evil tyrant....\n\nTake off and form up go as planned, 3 ships abort, leaving 20 of us in the middle of the bomber stream, this is the veteran HELL'S ANGELS 35th combat mission!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBomb Aircraft works at sector C6\n\nSee recon photo ( static camera)\n\n\nExit map at Sector N10 to complete mission\n\n\n\n\n
