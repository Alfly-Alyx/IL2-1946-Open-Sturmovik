Name mission 21
Short \u0020mission to Germany\n
Description 25th July 1943\n\n \nWe lost just the one ship on July 4th - THE MUGGER, but hit the target good and hard.\n\nYou sit out the next 4 missions, spending your time training the new greenhorns hard, we only lost one more ship in that time - our own 358th MEMPHIS BLUES, which was hit bad by flak and ditched in the English Channel, RAF Spitfires watched over Lt Swaffer and his crew as they bailed out and waited for the rescue launch which took them home to Blighty , what a way for Swaffer to complete his 25th mission!\n\nThe 303rd is often the lead bomb group now, and with more and more crews ready for action you are looking forward to flying fewer missions - if your pride will let you! \n\nAt last our armies are on the move again - on July 10th, Patton and Monty's troops landed on Sicily against little opposition, our airforce has total control of the area, and our 8th Bomber Command B24 units seem to be having a nice little summer holiday on loan to the 15th Airforce! Over half of Sicily is already captured...next stop Italy..\n\nBut today another new crew need your help and with the top brass making this week a so called 'Blitz Week' with around the clock bombing of German targets every crew is needed. Today we go to the Shipbuilding Yards at Hamburg, the RAF hit it hard last night, if there's anything left we'll destroy it today!\n\nTwenty of our ships take to the sky, and with no aborts we fly in our perfect tight formation, we should have no probem finding our target today - just head for the smoke left by the RAF Heavies..\n\n \n \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n              *** FORMATION AIR START ***\n\n               *** SET THROTTLE AT 80% ***\n\n\nBomb Hamburg Shipbuiding Yards at sector X24 - see recon photo (static camera view)\n\nReach exit point at sector A28 to finish mission\n\n\n\n
