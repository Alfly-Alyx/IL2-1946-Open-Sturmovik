Name mission 7
Short First mission to Germany\n
Description 27th January 1943\n\nThe mission on the 23rd turned into a disaster, we encountered heavy flak and lots of enemy fighters, and by the time we reached the target only 13 of us were left to drop our bombs, and worse still only 12 made it back to Molesworth.\n\nWe lost 5 ships and their crews, our own HELLCAT was last seen with an engine on fire going down near Brest, the 359th lost GREEN HORNET, the 360th lost BEATS ME, and the 427th lost SUSFU and JERRY JINX. Four other ships made crash landings in England, including our own WEREWOLF which landed in the grounds of a mental hospital in Dawlish, Devonshire!\n\nIf this goes on we will not have anyone left to fly in a few weeks, and our goal of flying 25 missions to get our ticket home now seems like an impossible dream, it now looks like i'll either be dead, a POW or go mad before seeing the good ol' USA again, if I were in the crew of WEREWOLF I would have booked a place in that mental hospital for the duration!\n\nIt seems us bomber guys are getting a lot of flak from critics both sides of the pond about the success of our daylight bombing, and Gen Eaker feels for us like a father, so to boost morale and get our confidence back today's very early briefing at 0545 hrs, has for the very first time Germany as the target! Yes, Maj Green and Lt Von Schmidt announce todays target - the U-boat construction yards at Vegesack on the North Sea coast of Germany, the Brits have attacked this 4 times already, so now we are going in to finish the job. heavy cloud is expected again, so if the target is obscured we'll fly along the coast a bit more and hit the naval base at Wilhelmshaven.\n\nOnly 11 ships are able take off at 0930, and soon 3 have turned  back with problems, the remaining 8 of us huddle in close formation as we gain altitude and head out over the North Sea, we soon link up with the other bomber groups and 60 B17s are heading for Germany, we fly behind the 306th BG, who looks like will have the honor of being first ever group to bomb Germany...\n\nEnemy coast ahead...our eyes peel every inch of the sky for fighters...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n              *** FORMATION AIR START ***\n\n               *** SET THROTTLE AT 80% ***\n\nPrimary target is covered by cloud - Bomb Wilhelmshaven Naval Base at sector X24 - see recon photo  (static camera view)\n\nReach exit point at sector A28 to finish mission\n\n\n
