Name mission 2
Short Attack Lille\n
Description 6th December 1942\n\nOnce again all our B17s made it back home, even if a few had some flak holes in them! You are forced to sit out another mission the next day due to electrical problems, and only 12 ships were fit to fly. Luck finally left us as well, we lost our first B17,  LADY FAIRWEATHER from the 359th was on her first mission when FW190s dived out of the sun after the 303rd had turned for home, the Germans attacking in small groups of 2 or 3 set fire to her, and the ship was last seen in flames heading down into the sea. Another ship HOLY MACKEREL the lead plane in the 359th had a bizarre time of it - she was hit by flak in the nose, sending red hydraulic fluid leaking into the navigator's position and destroying the intercom, thinking it was blood and that the pilot and co-pilot must be dead he baled out over the target, and was last seen floating down to earth with flak going off all around him in his chute!\n\nAgain the damn weather is stopping all activity, two missions have been cancelled on the 28th Nov and 3rd Dec, and the men are getting nervous again after being on a high after the first 2 missions. We now have a new boss as well - General Eaker is taking over the helm, so that Gen Spaatz can help Eisenhower in North Africa.\n\nAt last today we are go for action, Major Green and Lt Von Schmidt (A good american name!) brief us at 0730, and for the first time we are flying well inland to hit rail transport works in Lille, the German's are sure to react to protect this, so we are very pleased to hear that British Spitfires will be escorting us the whole way!\n\nOur wonderful ground crews have got 20 ships ready for action, we in the 358th will take off and form up with the 360th and 427th who are already up and circle the base waiting for us,  the 359th are last up and  form up on us, six 358th ships line up for takeoff, as usual JERSEY BOUNCE leads us away, with SPOOK, SKY WOLF, HELL CAT, ONE O'CLOCK JUMP and HELLS ANGELS..\n\n" the RAF better show up on time.." is muttered by all crews as they clamber inside their ships!\n\nHere we go again...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBomb rail works at sector I4  - see recon photo (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
