Name mission 1
Short Attack St Nazaire\n
Description 16th November 1942\n\nA sharp intake of breath is all you can manage  as a fellow 358th Bomb Squadron pilot passes on the news that at last the order has come through - we attack tomorrow - THIS IS IT!\n\nAs a late arrival with the 303rd Bombardment Group at Kellogg Field Michigan, you had hardly got to know your new buddies before you all had to make the long flight by stages to England and the 303rd's new 'home' at Molesworth Cambridgeshire, arriving on 21st October. You are now part of a new phase of this war - strategic bombing, the 303rd now joins the 1st Bombardment Wing, 8th Bomber Command.\n\nThe last three weeks have been crazy, men running around everywhere, everything to be sorted, orders being barked out, and the pilots and crew knitting together and slowly becoming a team, it's amazing just how many men are needed just to run a bomber squadron, you need a map just to find all the sections - HQ, Technical Supply, Equipment section, intelligence section, Refueling, Oxygen, supply, medical, weapons, food....\n\nAs for us aircrew the weather seems to more of an enemy than the Nazis, the bitter cold, foggy and wet English winter is setting in, and we've had to cancel many a training flight due to poor conditions, at least our welcome has been warm, the locals have taken us to their hearts, and anywhere you drive around Molesworth Village or the surrounding area you are greeted as Heros, but inside we feel bad that we've done nothing to deserve it - yet! \n\nEven the English girls are much prettier than you were told to expect, and the fact that you all maybe dead tomorrow means most of us Yanks are determined to enjoy life to the full during any spare time we get!\n\nYes tomorrow, THIS IS IT !\n\nLaying in your bunk, sleep will not come, you try and go over everything you need to know - aircraft recognition, securty, radio codes, becoming a prisoner of war, escape...the film we were shown tonight isn't helping you sleep either, it was called           ' Next of Kin'....\n\nAs a final resort you open up your Army Pilots book and yet again read your responsibilities -\n\n" Your assignment to the B17 airplane means that you are no longer just a pilot. You are now an airplane commander, charged with all the duties of a command post. You are flying a 10 man weapon, it is your airplane, and your crew. You are responsible for the safety and efficiency of the crew at all times - not just when you are flying and fighting, but for the full 24 hours of every day while you are in command. Your success as the airplane commander will depend on the respect, confidence and trust which the crew feels for you. You can be a good CO and still be a regular guy, you can command respect from your men and still be one of them"\n\n17th November 1942\n\n....War Order.....303rdBG......target.....U-Boat Submarine Pens...St. Nazaire..France...crews 16....bombing altitude...20,000ft....\n\nMorning comes like a bad dream, everyone tries to have a good breakfast, and nervous smiles are everywhere, our ground crews have already been working for hours trying to make ready our huge complicated B17 bombers, before we know it each pilot is huddled by his ship giving his crew one last pep talk, you shake each of your crew by the hand and wish them  ' good luck'\n\nMajor Wurzbach, an experienced B17 commander will fly as your co-pilot today to help you in your first mission.\n\nHarold Fulghum - Navigator\nJimmy Rodriguez - Engineer\nEverett Dasher - Radio Operator\nDonald Bone - Bombardier\nJames Sadler - tail gunner\nAl Meddaugh Jr - Right waist gunner\nGeorge Hall    - Left waist gunner\nClifton Fincher - Ball gunner\n\nand your name on the top of the crew list Captain Irl Baldwin.\n\nAll four squadrons of the 303rd BG have got ships on this mission, the 359th and 427th are airborne and circle the base, it's the 5 B17s in our 358th next, then the 359th....\n\nYou taxi onto the runway with your fellow 358th ships, each one with it's own name and nose art - to bring it luck, and a safe return to dear o'l Blighty, the bright colors stand out on our olive drab ships, you read the names off to yourself as you pass them - Jersey Bounce, Hunga Dunga, Sky wolf, Werewolf...and you very own Hell's Angels line up for takeoff...\n\nFlak City here we come...\n\nTHIS IS IT !\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBomb U-Boat Pens at sector A1- see recon photo (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission\n\nSkin - 358th_HellsAngels_VKD  (markings off)\n\n\n\n\n
