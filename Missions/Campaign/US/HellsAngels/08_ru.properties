Name Mission 8
Short Mission 8\n\nattack industrial targets in Germany\n
Description 4th February 1943\n\nThe mission to Germany sure did give the Group a boost, and the crews that didn't fly were jealous as hell that they didn't get to go on this 'milk run' and all our ships made it home. Just as importantly because of the switch of target our group is now claiming to be the first to bomb Germany, much to the anger of the 306th BG who claim that their bombers dropped bombs 1 minute before us!\n\nOnce we had landed, we were mobbed by press photographers, correspondents, newsreel cameras from all the big newspapers and magazines, just what you want after a 6 hour mission! The movie men had to do several takes before  they were happy with our answers - nobody told us we had to be film stars as well ! But by the time we had drunk a few beers that night, and toasted the 306th for being the second best outfit in the 8th, we once again felt we were a winning team.\n\nOur own Lt Oxrider in SPOOK was one of the aborts and didn't feel like joining in the fun, as we were heading out over the English Channel a life raft came undone inside his plane, it hit the left waist gunner and set the gun off going wild, and put a couple of slugs into the tail gunner's ass, so he had to return to base !\n\nMore good news, the British General Monty and his Desert Rats have captured Tripoli in North Africa, it's funny that the Brits are winning battles now that they have American tanks and planes, jeezaloo how did they manage to survive for 3 years without us ! \n\nThe weather and freezing temperatures mean many missions are being cancelled, but today we are given the green light, we are to attack marshalling yards in Hamm Germany, after the usual early briefing, at 0902 hrs13 B17s take off and climb over the Channel and head out over the bleak North Sea, as we gain altitude the temperature drops below the limit of our B17 thermometer - minus 40 centigrade! Six ships have already aborted before we reach the enemy coast, that leaves 7 of us of the 303rd in the 60 strong bomber stream, only HELLS ANGELS and  SKY WOLF represent the 358th, lets hope this damn cold effects the Nazis as much as us!\n\nOver the intercom you tell your boys to keep a good look out, they all know the drill by now, but a few words and a joke will calm the nerves...\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n              *** FORMATION AIR START ***\n \n             *** SET THROTTLE TO 80%  ***\n\n\nBomb Industrial targets at sector L13\n\nExit map at sector A11 to end mission\n\n\n\n\n\n
