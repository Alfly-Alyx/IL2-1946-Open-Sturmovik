Name Mission 11
Short Attack on Rotterdam\n
Description 4th March 1943\n\nWe all made it back from the Wilhelmshaven mission on the 26th of Feb - we got lucky that the enemy fighters either didn't press home their attacks or focused on the other groups. Our 2 press reporters were too excited to be afraid, and of course they used the most unpopular phrase we have-\n\n " the flak was so thick you could walk on it.."\n\nBut the guys enjoy the attention that these reporters bring, and the folks back home can read what their heros are going through!  One of the reporters -Walter Cronkite shows us his report the next day..\n\n" American Flying Fortresses have just come back from an assignment to hell; a hell 26,000 feet above the earth, a helll of burning tracer bullets and bursting gunfire, of crippled Fortresses and burning German fighter planes, of parachuting men and others not so lucky. I have just returned with a Flying Fortress crew from Wilhelmshaven.."\n\nOur growing confidence and numbers mean we are back in the air the very next day to the U-Boat pens at Brest, again we all made it back home despite heavy flak. For a change we had RAF Spitfires escorting us to the coast and back again, and they did an excellent job of keeping the German fighters away, it shouldn't be too long before we have American fighters to provide our escort, if only our engineers back home could give us a fighter with a longer range...\n\nThe weather gives us a rest for a week, until today, when once again we head to Germany, this time as lead Group - target Hamm, 18 Fortresses take off at 0800, we only have 2 aborts by the time we cross the Dutch coast but the weather is not looking good, the target is changed to railroad yards in Rotterdam - great a much shorter mission!\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n \n            *** FORMATION AIR START ***\n\n                  *** Set Throttle to 80% ***\n\nAttack railroad yards at sector F4\n\nExit map at sector A2 to complete mission\n\nSkin - \n
