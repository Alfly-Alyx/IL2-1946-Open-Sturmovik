Name mission 13
Short \u0020mission to Germany\n
Description 18th March 1943\n\nThe mission on the 12th and the next on the 13th to Ameins were both milk runs, thanks in no small part to excellent fighter cover, our gunners joked they should have taken a good book with them or had a snooze for a few hours - any German fighter that got near us was pounced on by loads of Spitfires. Apart from testing our guns we never fired a shot!\n\nBut today might not be such a picnic as we are briefed on today's mission to Vegesack Germany to attack U-Boat yards. The enemy now know our normal route to the German coast - out over the North Sea, over Heligoland and on to the target, as soon as we reach the coast we know the fighters will be waiting and as ever there will be a few extra flak guns as well!\n\nYet another first today, our lead bombers have been equiped with AFCE - automatic flight control equipment, this links with our bombsights and takes over control of the B17 so that small adjustments can be made on the bomb run to get our bombs smack on the button, so we will bomb by squadron lead ships not Group today so that 4 crews can use it.\n\nIt's a maximum effort today, and we put up 20 ships, and as you call on the intercom -\n\n" enemy coast ahead.."\n\nWe've not had any aborts, we are the lead Group today, so we are followed by the other 3 B17 Groups, 91st, 305th and 306th, they call us 4 Groups  the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and the 2 B24 Groups - 44th and 93rd, follow the  'Four Horsemen' into Germany...\n\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n              *** FORMATION AIR START ***\n\n               *** SET THROTTLE AT 80% ***\n\nAttack U-Boat Construction Yards at Vegesack  - sector X24 - see recon photo (static camera view)\n\nReach exit point at sector A28 to finish mission\n\nSkin -\n
