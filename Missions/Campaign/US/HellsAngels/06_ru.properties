Name mission 6
Short Attack Lorient\n
Description 23rd January 1943\n\nWell the 'milk run' on the 13th sort of lived up to it's name, all our ships came home, and of course we had lots of flak holes that needed patching up - well the ground crew need something to do! The group  still lost one man , who died of oxygen failure, and a couple of other crews had cases of frostbite.\n\nThe German fighters didn't seem to like our new combat box - although we spotted plenty of enemy fighters, only a few pressed home attacks, so despite our feeling on the 'box' it will now be SOP along with having a lead bomber for the group.\n\nAnother early morning brief today, and yet again we are going to hit the Lorient U-Boat pens, we are told that these U-Boat targets are still top priority, with England depending on merchant shipping to bring in supplies, hitting the U-Boats where it hurts will shorten the war.\n\nCol Robertson in JOE BTFSPLK 2 is leading the group today, and 21 B17s have roared into the air, we are soon in our well rehearsed form up routine and heading out over the ocean..looks like one of the 359th ships has aborted, so that leaves 20 of us to slowly form into our box formation, through the frost forming on your windows you concentrate on keeping in perfect time with the other 358th ships - SPOOK, HELL CAT, WEREWOLF and OLD FAITHFUL, the French coast looms into view, you know that today will not be a milk run....\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n            ***FORMATION AIR START ***\n\n            *** SET THROTTLE TO 80%  ***\n\nBomb U-Boat Pens at sector A1 - see recon photo (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
