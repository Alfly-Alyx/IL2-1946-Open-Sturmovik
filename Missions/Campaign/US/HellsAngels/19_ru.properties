Name Mission 19
Short Attack Aircraft Works at Villacoublay\n
Description \n26th June 1943\n\nOver a month has past by since your last mission, and the big party after! The raid on the 13th of May was seen as our most perfect so far - 21 ships took off, 21 attacked, and 21 returned to base safely!\n\nThe B17 formations were completly protected by our fighters, and most importantly the target was completely destroyed, and our Group leader Maj Gen Hagenbunch said - \n\n" One of the finest examples of high altitude precision bombing done by the US Army Air Force in this theatre of war to date "\n\nSeveral other B17s and crews have now reached the magic 25 mission mark, and many other guys are now near the end of their tours, this is good news for the folks back home who can now at least believe that their loved ones have a good chance of completing a tour, but this means that training the steady stream of new pilots and crews is ever more important, and it's been my job to help teach the new pilots about  what to expect and our routines and procedures here in the 358th Squadron - all the things that you had to learn the hard way!\n\nWe've brought in a 'combat indoctrination' system in the 303rd, using seasoned instructor pilots like myself to see the replacement crews through the tricky first few missions, but this does mean I will have to volunteer to fly combat missions with new crews every so often - so i'm not out of the woods yet!\n\nMeanwhile the missions keep coming, and with them the inevitable losses -\n\nOn May 14th we lost FDRs Potato Peeler Kids, and amongst the crew, one Mark Mathis, six chutes were seen to open, we all hope for the Mathis familie's sake Mark was one of them...\n\nOn the 16th of May a crack British squadron with a small number of bombers, attacked and destroyed 5 German Dams using special torpedoes, causing huge damage to industrial targets.\n\nAnother 5 missions were flown in May, on the 29th YARDBIRD another original 303rd ship went down.\n\nPoor weather at the start of June gave us a rest, but on June 11th we lost PAPPY/GOOD SNUF, on the 22nd we lost HUNTING CLUB, and only yesterday we lost THE AVENGER and THE WITCHES TIT. \n\nThis means that my good old HELL'S ANGELS is needed today to make up the numbers for a maximum effort mission, so you and your well trained new crew are going to attack the Aircraft Works at Villacoublay, France. \n\nAnother new tactic that is being tried to stem B17 losses, is the use of special heavily armed B17 Gunships, these ships carry no bombs, but have extra guns and ammo and a front chin turret, they fly infront or on the outside of our combat boxs to protect the rest of us, they are still in very limited numbers, but we've got one ship to come with us today!\n\nTwenty ships take off, but 3 abort leaving 16 of us and our gunship as we near the French coast, we look like a ragtag bunch, war weary weathered ships next to fresh pristine new arrivals, and some ships with the new Stars n Bars with red outline - we never seem to have enough paint to do all the ships at once, but there does seem to be many English houses near our base with a fresh coat of white or yellow paint, somebody is making a fast Buck somewhere!\n\n.....You try and remind yourself why you volunteered for more missions...here we go again...!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                 ***FORMATION AIR START***\n\n               ***SET THROTTLE TO 80%***\n\n\nAttack the Aircraft Works at Villacoublay in sector K2\n\nsee recon photo ( static camera)\n\nExit map at sector I10 to complete mission\n\n\nskin - 358th_Hells_Angels1943_VKD\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
