Name mission 5
Short Attack Lille\n
Description 13th January 1943\n\nWell the mission on the 3rd was our blackest day so far - each squadron lost a ship, we lost LEAPIN' LIZ, the 359th - HOLY MACKEREL, the 360th - SNAP!CRACKLE!POP! and the 427th - KALI which blew up in mid-air over the target, must have got a direct hit from the ever growing flak. 40 good men lost on one mission...\n\nIf there is any plus side it was the fact that the new bombing tactics put more bombs on target than any other raid, which should mean we will not have to visit the same targets over and over, and General Hansell admired the courage and skill of our crews.\n\n After waiting for the weather to improve again, today we are going back to the Lille locomotive works to try our new combat formation, with German fighters becoming more and more of a menace, the top brass have come up with a 'combat box' formation - ideally of 18 B17s flying very close together, to cover and protect each other, and the wings will fly in columns of groups. We've tried a few test flights of the new 'Box' and none of us are happy, we are flying much closer than usual and are getting prop wash from the ships in front - which is making flying steady much harder, and increasing the chance of collisions. But like good soldiers we will give it a try today!\n\nMaj Green briefs us early in the morning, and it looks like we have 19 ships ready for action including our very first replacement pilot 1Lt S Smith flying our first replacement B17 - THE 8 BALL MK2, and i'm to take a new crew with me today for this 'milk run' mission, to help make them combat ready before they join their own Captain, so it'll feel strange not having the normal gang with me!\n\nLooks like only 4 ships for our squadron today - SPOOK, SKY WOLF, HUNGA DUNGA, and you and the new boys in HELLS ANGELS.\n\nAs we hundle in groups by our B17s for the final pep talks, we all wonder when it will be our turn to be replaced...\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBomb rail works at sector I4  - see recon photo (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission\n\n\n\n\n\n
