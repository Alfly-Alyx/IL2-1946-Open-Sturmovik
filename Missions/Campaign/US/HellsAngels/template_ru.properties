Description 22nd November 1942\n\nAfter every 303rd B17 made it back home from the first mission you all walked 10 feet tall, you were now in the war!\n\nA total of 63 B17s and B24 Liberators attacked the target, but the weather was so bad you never saw the other groups, and with 5 of the 303rd ships aborting the mission it felt very lonely up there over France!\n\nOur group flew another mission the next day back to St Nazaire, but gremlins in your engines saw you and your crew sit this one out, you never new time could go so slow as you and all the ground crews wait for the returning ships, men try and keep busy working, reading, playing sports...when the ships are due home every eye strains to count them in and recognise their boys...once again Lady Luck brought back all our men, looks like our nose art is working!\n\nToday the group's third mission is going to Lorient, France, yet again to destroy U-Boat pens and facilities, after our 8am briefing, we have a couple of hours to get ourselves ready, it's a maximun effort by our group and our 21 Fortresss' are ready to join 4 other Bomb Groups, we may even get 100 bombers in the air! British Spitfires will also cover you until you reach the French Coast - if they can find us in the 10/10ths cloud !\n\nYou also now have Ripley Joy your proper Co-pilot beside you, he's happy to be away from the freezing waist gunner's hatch that he manned in the first mission! - Sgt George Hall takes over that role now.\n\nGod it's 1030am already, the butterflies in your stomach kick in, already 3 crews are having problems with their ships, that leaves 18 ready for takeoff, at least all 4 B17s of the 358th are ready to go - you line up behind the lead ship JERSEY BOUNCE on her third mission, SPOOK,  HELLCAT, and you in HELLS ANGELS are ready to go, YARDBIRD the sole 360th ship on this mission tags onto your group on the runway, lets go....\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBomb U-Boat Pens at sector A1 - see recon photo (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission\n\nSkin - \n\n\n\n\n
