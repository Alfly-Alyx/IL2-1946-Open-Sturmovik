Name Mission 24
Short Attack Schweinfurt\n
Description 17th August 1943\n\nAs is becoming usual on our milk-runs to France all our ships came home, with the usual flak holes and a couple of wounded fellas, and it was another good lesson for the rookies. We hit the airfield good and hard - our bombs smack on a line of hangers.\n\nAt last today all  the talk of a ' Big Show ' becomes reality as we are briefed on today's special  ' Double Strike' mission to celebrate the first aniversary of the 8th Airforce's bombing campaign. The room is full of whispers as the complex mission is explained to us by the planners...\n\nThere's going to be three bomber task forces - the first one of 150 B17s will attack the Messerschmitt factory at Regensburg, but after they've bombed, instead of turning for home, they will fly onto bases in N.Africa, this will confuse the German defences and leave the path clear for the other two task forces - of about 115 B17s each,  to attack the V.F.K.  Ball Bearing Works at Schweinfurt, Germany, then turn for home and safety while the German fighters are refueling or chasing after the 1st Task Force!\n\nWe are told that by destroying this huge ball bearing factory we will cause insurmountable problems to the Nazi war industry, 500 American and British fighters will escort us outward and homeward bound, but the target is deep inside Germany, 600 miles away so we'll be on our own with no escort for a long time...\n\nThe 303rd is putting up 30 ships today, 12 will join a composite wing in the 2nd Task Force, while the other 18 of us join the 3rd Task Force. Also our medium bombers will fly a diversion mission to France to draw off any other enemy fighters.\n\nAs you all shuffle out of the briefing room the C.O puts his arm around your shoulder -\n\n" this will be your last combat mission son...make sure it's a good one and Jerry gets really smacked...and come back in one peice! "\n\nThe crews gather at their ships, the words SNAFU and FUBAR are jokingly mouthed, there's a lot of things that could go wrong on this mission...\n\nOf all things the weather has caused problems for take off, and some Groups are up to an hour late taking off, our 3rd Task Force takes shape and heads out across the Channel and over Holland, we have 1 abort and another ship turns for home after catching some flak as we pass Antwerp, so far the mission seems perfect, and not a sniff of any enemy fighters! Are we really going to sneak all the way into Germany and out again without a scratch?!\n\nWe are now nearing the German border, our huge formation a fantastic sight to behold, the 358th has drawn the short straw today and we are in the vunerable low squadron position at the rear of the combat box, and it's not called Purple Heart corner for nothing...flak  is starting to  follow us...where are those enemy fighters...?\n\n " ...Bandits 12 O'Clock skipper...."\n\n" keep your eyes peeled boys..."\n\n" here they come...!
