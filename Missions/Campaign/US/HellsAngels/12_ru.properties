Name mission 12
Short Attack Rouen\n
Description 12th March 1943\n\nThe mission to Hamm was another case of S.N.A.F.U out of the 4 bomber groups despatched, we and the 305th BG were the only ones that got the message to divert to Rotterdam, the 306th returned to base and when the 16 ships of the 91st got near the primary target and the cloud cleared, they found themselves all alone, but bravely pushed onto the target and did a textbook attack, on the trip home they were attacked by what they thought was the entire Luftwaffe - about 200 Nazi fighters! They were damn lucky only to lose 4 B17s.\n\nWe were lucky yet again, and had no lost or damaged ships but two days later on a trip to attack a power station at Lorient we lost one B17 from the 360th but did have some very good direct hits on the target. \n\nWe've also been getting a few new crews and fresh new B17s for them to wreck, in the 358th we've got THE HUNTING CLUB and TWO BEAUTS joining our little club, with the latter sporting the most popular art work in the squadron, and certainly more attractive than the 360th's new ship  THE WITCHE'S TIT which has already become the most notorious nose art in the Group!\n\nSo it's back to France again today to hit Marshalling Yards at Rouen, take off at 1000, with RAF and American Spitfires as escorts, should be a milk run...\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBomb Marshalling Yards at Rouen at sector I4  - see recon photo (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission\n\nSkin - \n\n\n\n\n
