Name mission 18
Short Attack Potes Aircraft Factory\n
Description 13th May1943\n\nThis is it, our 25th Mission !\n\nYou cannot believe that you have survived so long! Everyone is in a good mood, bad weather for a week  had left us with an agonising wait for this mission, but our luck looks like holding out as today's early briefing shows us our target for today is the Potes Aircraft Factory in Meaulte, Northern France, which means Spitfire and P47 cover all the way and the prospect of another milk run for our 303rd, which is the lead Group today.\n\nMore good news at the briefing - the war in North Africa is all but over...we are just waiting for the official announcements over the wireless, this means that it's next stop Italy for Monty and Patton, and straight up to the middle of Europe, the rumours have already started...the war will be over by Christmas!\n\nAlso today the era of the ' Four Horsemen' ends with the number of our groups in the 8th Bomber Command now 8 instead of 4 and with our group numbers growing and aborts less, it's hoped that missions of up to 500 B17s will soon be launched, or that diversionary raids can be launched to confuse the German's as to where the main strike will be.\n\nThe C.O has put the HELL'S ANGELS in the middle of the combat box today - the safest place, so they say....\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nBomb the Potes Aircraft Factory at sector I4  - see recon photo (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission\n\n\n\n\n
