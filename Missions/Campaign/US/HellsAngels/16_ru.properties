Name Mission 16
Short Attack Renault Motor Works, Paris\n
Description 4th April 1943\n\nIt was yet another good mission on the 28th, the Spitfires took care of any enemy fighters, and our bombing was on target, and all ships returned to base. It was your turn to be interviewed by a reporter after the mission - \n\n"So Captain how was the mission.."\n  \n       " Well it's getting to be like a habit, we go over, drop our bombs and fly back. Our bombing is improving all the time. We haven't always totally destroyed what we went after, but the day will soon come when we will."\n\n" Were all your raids in the same aeroplane, Captain...? "\n\n       " Yes Sir, the HELL'S ANGELS has gone over 20 times, and every time over the target, that's a pretty good record! "\n\nYou hope that you haven't jinxed your crew with your remarks, but on the next mission 3 days later it's two other crews that are jinxed - it should have been a milk run to Rotterdam, but on the outbound leg while still over England the Group flew through some heavy cloud, and two ships, OOOLD SOLJER and TWO BEAUTS collided and crashed. Somehow 2 men from each ship managed to bail out and survive, but it's still a bitter lost for the Group, especially the veteran crew in 'Ooold Soljer'. But the mission went on without a hitch and the rest of us made it home to mourn yet more pals.\n\nSo today is our first raid in April, and we're off to the outskirts of Paris, France, to hit the Renault Motor Works, this big industrial plant was hit hard by the RAF last year, but we are told in today's briefing that it has been rebuilt, and is making over one thousand vehicles a month for the German Army, so with good weather forecast we have a chance to deal a big blow to the Nazis.\n\nAfter taking off, it takes 2 hours for the 100 ships of our 4 Groups to form up and head out, it's a maximum effort raid, so our Group has put up an impressive 23 B17s, three aborts leave 20 ships as we near the coast, just ahead of us the 305th lead the way, and our beloved RAF Spitfires are perfectly placed to pounce on any attackers...\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                 ***FORMATION AIR START***\n\n               ***SET THROTTLE TO 80%***\n\n\nAttack the Renault Motor Works at sector K2\n\nsee recon photo ( static camera)\n\nExit map at sector I10 to complete mission\n\n\n\n
