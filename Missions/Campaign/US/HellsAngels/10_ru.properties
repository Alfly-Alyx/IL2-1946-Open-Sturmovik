Name mission 10
Short \u0020mission to Germany\n
Description 26th February 1943\n\nThe attack on St Nazaire went like all the others - lots of flak and fighters and good bombing, but we all know that we'll have to go back there soon, and every time we go back it's a little bit tougher.\n\nWe lost another two damn good crews as well, the 360th lost SHAK HAK to fighters and our own SPOOK committed the cardinal sin of leaving our formation to help a damaged B17 being attacked by a few 109s below us, but as we lost sight of the 2 bombers even more enemy fighters were seen to join in, and neither plane returned home. Once again we are reminded to never leave the combat box, the cowardly Nazis seem to love attacking our wounded and damaged ships that are easy pickings on their own, it's a heart breaking feeling seeing one of your own squadron drop out of formation in trouble and there's not a damn thing you can do to help them....\n\nBut this war goes on, today we go back to Germany for the third time - to attack industrial areas in Bremen, secondary target is Wilhelmshaven, and bang on time 19 of our ships take off into the dreary mist of merry old England, as usual those evil little gremlins start their work and before we are near the enemy coast 7 B17s have aborted, leaving a dozen of us  to form with the bomber stream, now about 70 B17s and B24s will bring the war to the Germans front door...\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n              *** FORMATION AIR START ***\n\n               *** SET THROTTLE AT 80% ***\n\nPrimary target  Bremen is covered by cloud - Bomb Wilhelmshaven Naval Base at sector X24 - see recon photo (static camera view)\n\nReach exit point at sector A28 to finish mission\n\n\n\n
