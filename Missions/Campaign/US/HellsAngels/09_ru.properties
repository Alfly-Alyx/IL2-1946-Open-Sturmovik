Name mission 9
Short Attack St Nazaire\n
Description 16th February 1943\n\nAnother very early start today, but not to Germany but back to Flak City aka St Nazaire, breakfast was at 0445 and an hour later you are at the briefing, we go in at 25,000 ft with 1000 lbs demolition bombs, so yet another damn cold mission!\n\nThe cold is one of our worst enemies, it freezes guns and equipment and instruments, freezes our cockpit glass and freezes us men as well! \n\nOn the 4th of Feb most of our aborts where due to freezing, we bombed well, but still lost one ship - MEMPHIS TOT from the 427th, and our own OLD FAITHFUL got shot up bad, with the pilot Lt McDonald ducking just at the right time as a 20mm shell hit where his head would have been, and the bombardier Schieble was saved by his pistol taking a direct hit from a 20mm shell instead of hitting him! \n\nTwo days ago we had our first recalled mission due to 10/10 tenths cloud and bitter cold. Of course we have our heated suits but half the time they don't heat enough or not at all, and the other half of the time they burn us! Often the gunners are so cold and miserable they just do not care what happens in the mission, they just want to be warm!\n\nLike clockwork the ground crews ready our ships, and now we sit on the runway waiting our turn to take off in our ever reliable HELL'S ANGELS for our 9th mission! \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBomb port area at sector A1\n\nsee recon photo for target (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission\n\n\n\n\n
