Name mission 4
Short Attack St Nazaire\n
Description 3rd January 1943\n\nThe 6th December mission was a great success, although again we had lots of aborts, we really hit the target hard, and the fighter escort did a great job keeping the Nazi planes busy, the group also claimed 12 German fighters shot down for no loss to ourselves, but our ground crews again face some long cold nights patching up holes in our ships! That night we toast the British Spitfire pilots in our best English accents - " Jolly good show!"\n\nAgain you have to sit out the next three missions due to technical problems, the engines on our B17s are reliable and powerful and can take alot of damage, but they are short lived, and it's becoming a common sight to see our ships with 1,2 or even all 4 engines being replaced. Anyway on the 12th December the group went to Rouen, we lost WULFE HOUND and ONE O'CLOCK JUMP, on the 20th we hit Romilly - ZOMBIE was lost and THE 8 BALL crash landed in England, and on the 30th Lorient was hit again for no loss.\n\nThe new year weather has started crisp and clear, as yet again we are briefed to hit St Nazaire, in an effort to put more bombs on the target we are going to try a new tactic today, against our instincts we have been ordered  to have a longer bomb run with no weaving to avoid flak! and also we are going to have a lead bomber and all the other group ships will drop their bombs when he does, that honour goes to Maj Wallace in the 427th in S-FOR-SUGAR, who just for added pressure has got General Hansell CO of the 1st Bomber Wing coming along for the ride!\n\nAs we all prepare for the mission, we know this clear weather is just what the Luftwaffe wants, and with St Nazaire well beyond the Spitfire's range and our group flying in a long straight bomb run you hope luck is with YOU today!\n\nAs we climb aboard some joker shouts out that the war will be over by next Christmas, enjoy it while you can.....\n\nWe are the last squadron up today, LEAPIN' LIZ, SPOOK, WEREWOLF, and HELLS ANGELS will join the17 303rd ships and help make up over 100 bombers on todays trip to 'Flak City'.\n\nGentlemen start your engines....\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBomb Torpedo storage areas at sector A1\n\nWatch for the lead bomber, and release your bombs when they do.\n\nsee recon photo for target (camera view)\n\nReturn To base to complete mission\n\nSkin - \n\n\n\n\n
