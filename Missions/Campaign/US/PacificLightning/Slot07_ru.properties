There are some fat ducks on the lake in that area, and one thing they won't expect is if we go hunting.\n\nYou will progress to the base at wavetop height to avoid detection.  Strafe any enemy floatplanes you identify.  If these are not available, you may target freely.  Marine Air will accompany you as escort.  If you need to join them in aerial engagement, remember to jettison your tanks before doing so.\n
