Description 339th Fighter Squadron\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n347th Fighter Group\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n12th June 1943\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n1630 Hrs::::Weather: Good\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nExternal Ordnance: N/A\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nThe Empire's air offensive is maintaining its ferocity, despite the heavy losses we are inflicting.  They've no doubt seen the build-up for TOENAILS that's happening off Lunga, and are fully aware of what it is portending - their eviction from New Georgia.\n\nBy now, the enemy's actions are becoming little more than spoiling attacks, but that doesn't mean they can't upset our preparations.  We need our offensive efforts to run as smoothly as possible - there are other theaters in the Pacific that will soon require these resources, and we can't hold on to them forever.  Get up there and give those dive-bombers another beating.  Let's teach Tojo to keep his nose out of our business.\n
