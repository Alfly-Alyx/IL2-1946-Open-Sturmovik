Description 339th Fighter Squadron\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n347th Fighter Group\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n7th June 1943\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n1105 Hrs::::Weather: Good\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nExternal Ordnance: N/A\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nThe enemy has been quiet since the licking we gave him in April, but it looks like he's a sucker for punishment and is coming back for more.  It's his usual set up - dive-bombers and Zekes, but now we've got another surprise for him - our airfields on the Russells are operational and we can intercept him from further out.  Looks like your P-38's won't get first bite of the cherry this time....\n\nProbably a good thing for all you new boys who've turned up to replace the Yamamoto crews.  Your careers will be longer and probably less glorious than theirs, but at least you'll get to send more Japs to the bottom of the Solomon Sea.\n
