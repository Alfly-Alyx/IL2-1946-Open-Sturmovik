HE\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nThe Coastwatcher on Choiseul has identified a group of enemy ships heading down The Slot.  We presume their destination is New Georgia.  They are obviously taking advantage of the poor conditions to reinforce their garrison on the island.\n\nFollow the prepared route, which will take you to the calculated current location of the transports.  Sink them if you can.  Supreme Commander SWPA has identied New Georgia as a stepping stone to Bougainville, so we want to make taking it as easy for ourselves as possible.\n
