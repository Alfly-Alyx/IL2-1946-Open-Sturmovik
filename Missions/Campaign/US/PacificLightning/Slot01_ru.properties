Look out for enemy reconnaissance submarines, and any improvised water craft that loose bands of enemy personnel might be using to get off Guadalcanal.  We think we've cleaned them all up, but you never know when it comes to the Japs.\n\nAlso look out for enemy aircraft attempting to intervene in our landing on the Russells.  The islands are deserted, so we can get to work on our airfield building tasks almost straight away.  We expect our Oriental friends to react as soon as they figure what we're up to.  Don't make it easy for them....\n\n\n
