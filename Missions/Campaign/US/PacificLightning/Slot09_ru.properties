Description 339th Fighter Squadron\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n347th Fighter Group\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n7th April 1943\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n0515 Hrs::::Weather: Good\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nExternal Ordnance: N/A\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nRadar has picked up a single contact at high altitude heading toward us bearing 100 Degrees.  This is no doubt the enemy recon assessing the results of today's raids.  Climb to 30,000 feet and attempt an intercept.  If it's a Dinah then you will find it near-impossible to catch, but if you chase it away then that's almost as good.  Whatever, let's keep the prying eyes away from us.\n
