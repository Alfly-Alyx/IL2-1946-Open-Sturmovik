As you are no doubt aware this is the first step in the overall CARTWHEEL operation to reduce Rabaul.  There have been two landings as part of the plan - an Eastern Force, which has seized Wickham Anchorage and the enemy crash strip at Seghi Point, and the main Western Force, which has captured Rendova Island.  \n\nThese landings have so far proved to be a resounding success, and we hope to soon move on to the main phase - landings at Zenana Beach, and then a short overland hop to take Munda airfield.  We've certainly caught the enemy napping on the ground, but now their air force is responding.  We've just heard of the first attack wave hitting Sunday Inlet, and there's more on the way.  Get over there and join the Marines and the Navy in maintaining a patrol presence.  The Japs know this is the main game and will be throwing everything they can at us over the next few days.\n
