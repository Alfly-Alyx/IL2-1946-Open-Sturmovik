Description 339th Fighter Squadron\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n347th Fighter Group\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n7th August 1943\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n1050 Hrs::::Weather: Poor\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nExternal Ordnance: 2 x 500lbs. HE\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nWe have taken Munda, and the TOENAILS phase of operations is complete.  Work is already underway in clearing the strip for usage, and mopping up enemy pockets in the north of New Georgia.\n\nHowever, it is believed that a sizeable enemy garrison remains on Kolombongara.  In some ways that suits us as we can effectively seal them off and let them whither on the vine.  To this end, aerial reconnaissance has spotted what we suspect to be camouflaged enemy boats in Teme Cove.  You will destroy these vessels to minimise the risk of an enemy breakout.  SBD's will launch a simultaneous strike on the AAA positions at Vila Field in order to minimise ground fire.\n\nI would like to thank you for your participation in the successful prosecution of TOENAILS, and wish you luck in your re-assignment Stateside.  If you ever visit the Solomons again, I hope it is in much more comfortable circumstances.....\n
