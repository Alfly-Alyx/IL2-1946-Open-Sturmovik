Description 339th Fighter Squadron\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n347th Fighter Group\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n7th March 1943\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n0910 Hrs::::Weather: Good\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nExternal Ordnance: 2 x 250lbs. HE\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nCOMSOPAC has stressed to us the vital strategic importance of airfields in this theater.  As such, all our efforts are to be focused on both the neutralisation of enemy strips, and the capture and creation of our own forward bases.  COMAIRSOLS will co-ordinate the efforts of Thirteenth Air Force, Marine, Naval and ANZAC air forces to this end.\n\nOur calculation is that the enemy does not have the resources to project force across the entire SWPA and SOPAC areas.  Our strategy of capturing and/or bypassing his key installations should see him retreat from his Bismark-Solomons line and back to his mandates.  There can be no equilibrium in this theater - the balance of power will always tip in favor of the side that is best able to project air power to effective ends.\n\nCOMAIRSOLS has identified that the enemy appears to be building a hidden landing strip in the Munda vicinity of New Georgia.  We have been waiting for some time for the Japanese to respond to our seizure of the Russell Islands.  At last it appears he is beginning his build up.  One thing's for sure - we cannot afford for this base to become operational.  The threat it poses to us here at CACTUS cannot be over-emphasised.  The Japs have thrown down the gauntlet - you will pick it up and throw it back at them with HE attached.\n\nYou will strike the airfield and any ancilliary facilities.  Try at least to make a few craters.  You'll be given Dogs as escort - they won't be able to stick around for long so make it quick and make it count....\n
