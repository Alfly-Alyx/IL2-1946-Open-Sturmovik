Description 339th Fighter Squadron\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n347th Fighter Group\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n14th March 1943\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n1425 Hrs::::Weather: Poor\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nExternal Ordnance: N/A\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n11th BG will be hitting Munda this afternoon, and you are on escort.  Keep the Zekes away from the B-17' s.  Our round-the-clock harrassment of this facility appears to be working so far - we have had no known major raid either emanating from, or staging at, this field.\n\nAs you know, some of our bombers have been circling the strip all night, even throwing hand grenades and beer bottles out of the bomb doors to keep the Japs on their toes.  Let's keep making life miserable for them.  With a bit of luck they might even quit the island all together.\n
