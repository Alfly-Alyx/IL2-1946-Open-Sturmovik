Description 339th Fighter Squadron\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n347th Fighter Group\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n23rd May 1943\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n1010 Hrs::::Weather: Good\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nExternal Ordnance: 2 x Droptank\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nYou boys are on escort again, this time for 307th Bomb Group, who are hitting Shortland this morning.  As you are no doubt aware, they've taken a beating whenever they've gone over there on their own, so now that we can plumb your ships for droptanks, they're getting you as escorts.\n\nWatch out for fighter opposition over the target - it's a real hornets' nest over there.  Look out for each other and maintain combat discipline.  Hit them a firm blow in their own back yard - let us demonstrate who will be the dominant force in the air over these islands.\n
