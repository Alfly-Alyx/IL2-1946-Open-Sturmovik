Description 339th Fighter Squadron\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n347th Fighter Group\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n15th July 1943\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n1510 Hrs::::Weather: Poor\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\nExternal Ordnance: 2 x 500lbs. HE\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\nOur progress from Zenana to Munda has been painfully slow over the last couple of weeks.  This has many causes, including inexperienced troops, the thick jungle making good cover for the Japs, and the lack of an established trail through which to feed logistics.\n\n169th Infantry have hooked south to establish coastal positions to land supplies.  General Harmon has ordered a new assault towards Munda, but already 43rd Division have hit fixed enemy defenses at Horseshoe Hill.  For once, these are thought to be visible from the air.  We're taking the Marines' place in the usual strike allocation and targetting these positions.  172nd Infantry will help us out with identification via the use of phospherus grenades.  Destroy those positions and allow the attack to progress.\n
