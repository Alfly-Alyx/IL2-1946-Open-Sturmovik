Name Flying Tigers Over Burma 24
Short February 27, 1942\nRetreat from Rangoon\n
Description February 27, 1942\nTime:  0600  Weather:  Clear\n\nAfter the JAAF air superiority raids of the 25th and 26th and with the Japanese army advancing closer, the RAF moved their radar to Magwe leaving the pilots with little warning of an enemy raid.  With no advanced radar warning the Flying Tigers decided to quit Rangoon and move north to Magwe.\n\nThe RAF stayed at Mingaladon until March 6 and Rangoon fell to the Japanese on March 8, 1942.\n\nAt Magwe the remaining allied fighters fought one more large battle against an overwhelming force of Japanese bombers and fighters.  The allies then quit Magwe with the RAF moving to Akyab and the Flying Tigers moving to bases in China.  \n\nNewer P-40E models were becoming available with bomb-carrying capability and this allowed for more ground attack missions against the Japanese as they moved up the Sittang River to Toungoo and Pyinmana.  The Flying Tigers would retreat from Burma but would continue fighting in China and eventually be absorbed by the U.S. 14th Air Force.\n\nMission:\nTake a flight up to Magwe to save the surviving P-40s where they can fight another day.  This is the last mission in the battle for  Rangoon.  Say your goodbyes.\n
