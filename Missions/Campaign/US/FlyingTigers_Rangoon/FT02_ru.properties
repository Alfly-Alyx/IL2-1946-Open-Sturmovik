Description December 23, 1941\nTime:  1000  Weather:  Clear\n\nThe Japanese bombers were not in sync during the big raid on December 23.  The first wave had 15 Sally bombers and the next wave a while later had 18 Sally bombers.  This allowed the other P-40s to gain altitude and wait for a good advantage.\n\nMission:\nJapanese bombers are heading toward Rangoon from the southeast at 10,000 feet (3000m).  The second group of six Hell's Angels will patrol the Syriam oil field area and intercept the bombers coming from the southeast.\n
