Short January 24, 1942\nDefend Mingaladon\n
Description January 24, 1942\nTime:  1030  Weather:  Good\n\nThe Japanese bombers always seem to make the mistake of going far ahead of their escorts.  The Sally bombers especially do this by speeding up as they near the target and they quickly outdistance their slower Ki-27 escorts.\n\nThe day after the raid by the Ki-30s, the Japanese sent more heavy bombers to do the job.\n\nMission:\nIntercept incoming Japanese planes at 10,000ft (3000m)!  Seven P-40s from Mingaladon, two Hurricanes, and four Buffaloes will intercept the enemy coming from the east.\n
