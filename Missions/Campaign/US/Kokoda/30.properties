Description December 27, 1942\nBriefing at 1130 hours \n\nTO:  39th Fighter Squadron Commander\n\nThe big brass is honked off about the Japanese raid yesterday on Dobodura airfield.\n\nToday, they want your P-38s to fly high cover at the field & Cape Endaiadere where our troops are landing and to knock anything down that comes your way.\n\nCoast watchers are reporting fighters & Vals headed there from Lae so you may not have long to wait.\n\nWe also have information the Japanese army has for the first time committed aircraft to New Guinea.  We believe the experienced 11th Sentai flying Ki-43 fighters has been transferred to Lae & Rabaul.   Expect to see them today.\n\nGood luck on what is looking like your first major engagement with P-38s.\n\n\nLt. Col. RICHARD A. LEGG\n35th Fighter Group\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
