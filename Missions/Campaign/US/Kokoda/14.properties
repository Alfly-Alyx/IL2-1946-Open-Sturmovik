Today, we will start transporting U.S. troops there from Port Moresby by C-47.\n\nThe 8th FS will escort them.  You will land and remain at Wanigela.  [Don't taxi off the runway as there is a 6' drop from it to the grass.  This is a fault in the portable airstrip modeling.]\n\nThe 9th FS will escort C-47s making an air drop to U.S. ground troops that have marched to Arapara.\n\n\nLt. Col. PAUL B.
