Description November 14, 1942\nBriefing at 1830 hours \n\nTO:  7th  Fighter Squadron Commander\n\n\nThe Australians have now recaptured Wairopi airstrip and are trying to rebuild the bridge northeast of there.\n\nWe will air drop bridging equipment to them and the 9th FS will escort our C-47s to there.  This mission will be near dark so our transports have less chance of being discovered.\n\nTo keep the enemy occupied during this drop, a B-25 with extra guns in its nose will bomb & strafe the Wairopi - Buna trail at Soputa for which the 7th shall provide air cover.\n\nAs you close on the targeted  area, advance your fighters ahead of the B-25's course and engage any enemy aircraft that tries to interfere with its mission.\n\n\nLt.
