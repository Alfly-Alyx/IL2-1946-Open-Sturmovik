Description November 8, 1942\nBriefing at 1100 hours \n\nTO:  7th Fighter Squadron Commander\n \nThe Aussies have recaptured Kokoda airstrip and are pressing toward Wairopi.\n\nBecause the U.S. troops who advanced by ground to Jaure were in such poor condition upon arrival, we have decided to airlift more troops to newly created grass strips.\n\nThe 7th will escort C-47s carrying troops from here to Pongani, located on Oro Bay, where troops from Wanigela will be joining them for the assault on Buna.  Your squadron will land at Pongani and remain there.\n\n[When landing there, due to a game fault in the portable strip modeling, do not leave the landing strip to taxi or you will self-destruct.]\n\nThe 8th will escort C-47s transporting troops to another new field at Fasari.\n\nLt. Col. PAUL B. WURTSMITH\n49th Fighter Group\n\n                      Part 1 of a 2 Part Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
