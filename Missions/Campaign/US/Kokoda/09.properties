Description September 20, 1942\nBriefing at 1500 hours \n\nTO:  7th Fighter Squadron Commander\n\n\nWelcome to Port Moresby.  Sorry about the bad weather.  I hope your P-40s that arrived here yesterday are ready for action as they must fly today.  \n\nThe Japanese have driven us out of Efogi, past Naura, and are at Ioribaiwa, where they have stopped temporarily.   Our troops have entrenched at Imita Ridge, just south of there.\n\nWe'll start you off with bombing & strafing.\n\nYour 1st Flight will bomb Kokoda airstrip and the 2nd will go after the bridge on the Buna - Kokoda trail east of Wairopi.  On the way home, both flights will strafe the enemy on the track at Myola, Efogi, and Naura.\n\nEngage enemy aircraft if they are encountered.\n\n\nLt. Col. PAUL B. WURTSMITH\n49th Fighter Group\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
