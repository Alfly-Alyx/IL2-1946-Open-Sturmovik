Name Recon to Oro Bay
Short July 22, 1942\n\nU.S. P-39s and P-400s recon a landing reported at Oro Bay.\n\n
Description July 22, 1942\nBriefing at 0700 hours \n\nTO:  41st & 80th Fighter Squadron Leaders\n\n\nCoast watchers have reported some sort of landings are occurring at Oro Bay along the shoreline from Buna Village west for about 8 miles to a small place called Gona.\n\nMake a joint reconnaissance in force to see if anything is going on.   It is probably nothing but it will give you and your pilots a chance to survey the country up there.\n\nIf you encounter a landing force of any size whatsoever, attack it.\n\nEmergency landing fields at Kokoda and Wairopi are marked on your charts as recon points. \n\nI'll see you all back for lunch as I am sure there is nothing to this.\n\n\nBrig. Gen. ENNIS C. WHITEHEAD\nPt. Moresby Operations, 5th Air Force\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
