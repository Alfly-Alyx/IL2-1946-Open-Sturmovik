We will be waiting there at dawn to attack them.\n\nOur heavy bombers will be bombing Lae today so our medium & light bombers must do the job.   Your P-40s & other fighters will provide cover.\n\nToday, our ground forces will also make a determined assault on Buna Village.   If we can capture it, they will lose the use of their airfield.\n\n\nLt. Col. DONALD R.
