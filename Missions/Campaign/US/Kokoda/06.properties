Description August 20, 1942\nBriefing at 1700 hours \n\nTO:  41st  & 80th Fighter Squadron Leaders\n\n\nAs you are aware, since our recapture and loss again of Kokoda airstrip, our troops are again dug in the area of Isurava, just south of Kokoda.\n\nWe have been supplying them by air drop with our two remaining C-47s at the only open area available to us at the dry lake bed at Myola.\n\nYou will fly cover for these invaluable aircraft.  Fly ahead of them and form a perimeter of fighters around Myola which Zeros will be unable to penetrate.\n\nMyola Lake can be identified as the large, 3-pronged snow-covered open area just to the east of the Kokoda track.\n\nWe must not lose either of these transports.     \n\n \nBrig. Gen. ENNIS C. WHITEHEAD\nPt. Moresby Operations, 5th Air Force\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
