Description November 8, 1942\nBriefing at 1100 hours \n\n\nTO:  8th Fighter Squadron Commander\n\n\nA missionary has helped us locate another new field at Fasari village near Mt. Sapia.  \n\nThe 8th will escort C-47s transporting troops to there.   These U.S.  troops will then march to Pongani on Oro Bay.  Your flight will occur while the 7th FS escorts troop transports to Pongani and will spread enemy air strength.\n\nYour squadron will land and remain at Fasuri but stay on the landing strip when you land as taxiing off is dangerous [in fact fatal due to a fault in the portable landing strip modeling].\n\nThe 80th F.S., with its P-39s, has been transferred from Port Moresby to Milne Bay.\n\n\nLt. Col. PAUL B. WURTSMITH\n49th Fighter Group\n\n\n                       Part 1 of a 2 Part Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
