Name B-25 Attack on Oivi & Wairopi
Short July 25, 1942\n\nU.S. P-39s and P-400s support B-25s in an attack on Oivi Village & Wairopi air strips.\n\n
Description July 25, 1942\nBriefing at 1000 hours \n\n\nTO:  80th Fighter Squadron Commander\n\n\nThe Japanese have made startling progress down the Kokoda-Buna trail toward Kokoda.  In 3 days, they have travelled almost half way to Port Moresby and captured our airstrip at Wairopi.  They are at Oivi - just 6 miles from Kokoda. \n\nWe can't let them get our airstrip at Kokoda or we will have no where to bring in supplies.\n\nB-25s will bomb Oivi and the strip at Wairopi.    Zeros are operating in this area so you will fly escort but strafe these places yourself if the primary isn't destroyed by the bombers.\n\nKokoda's location is marked as a recon point for emergency landings.\n\n\nMajor WILLIAM A.
