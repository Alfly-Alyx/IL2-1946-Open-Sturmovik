Description August 8, 1942\nBriefing at 0600 hours \n\n\nTO:  41st Fighter Squadron Commander\n\nAt 45 minutes after dawn, the Aussies will attempt to recapture the Kokoda air strip.\n\nThat will give us just enough daylight to strafe the field and the defenses in front of the village before they attack.\n\nThis will be an all P-400 show.  Half your planes will conduct the strafing and half will fly CAP.   You'll probably have only a short time to strafe before Zeros appear.\n\nThe higher elevations will have less ground fog than the lowlands.\n\n\nLt. Col. RICHARD A. LEGG\n35th Fighter Group\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
