Description September 6, 1942\nBriefing at 1745 hours \n\nTO:  41st & 80th Fight Squadron and 8th Bombardment Squadron Commanders\n\n\nThe enemy has withdrawn from Milne Bay.  However, after a 4 day battle, we have had to fall back from Isurava and beyond Alola, Myola, Eora Creek, & Myola Lake.\n\nOur troops are now forming a line at Efogi Spur on the Kokoda Track.  You must give them time to do so.\n\nThe 80th's P-39s will dive-bomb them at Myola Lake while the 8th's A-20s strafe the enemy along the track just north of Efogi.    The 41st's P-400s will fly cover.\n\nThings are getting dicey.   There aren't too many places yet to retreat to.   We must hold soon or they will be on the improved road to Pt. Moresby.\n\n\nBrig. Gen. ENNIS C. WHITEHEAD\nPt. Moresby Operations, 5th Air Force\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
