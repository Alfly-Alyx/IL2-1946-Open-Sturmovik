Description December 2, 1942\nBriefing at 1800 hours \n\n\nTO:  8th Bombardment Squadron Commander\n\nA week of bombing and ground attacks have produced nothing in the Gona - Buna area.   Now there is a report of Japanese destroyers attempting to land reinforcements.\n\nYour A-20s armed with torpedos will advance to this area by way of Buna and then from the southeast, attack any enemy ships sighted.\n\nB-17s and B-25s will also bomb these ships.   Fighters from the 40th FS will fly cover for your attack.\n\nThis campaign appears far from over.  We are creating airstrips at Popondetta and Dobodura just outside the Japanese area of control in order to bring in supplies.\n\n\nBrig. Gen. ENNIS C. WHITEHEAD\nPt. Moresby Operations, 5th Air Force\n\n \n                     Part 1 of a 2 Part Mission\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
