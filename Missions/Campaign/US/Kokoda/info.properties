Name Kokoda Track Campaign
Short \n
Description In early 1942, the Japanese believed that if they captured Port Moresby, on the southern shore of New Guinea, they could cut the U.S. supply line to and even invade Australia.  However, they were defeated in the battle of the Coral Sea and lacked the naval strength to try again. \n\nUndeterred, they decided to land troops at Buna on the north coast of New Guinea and march across the 110 mile Owen-Stanley mountains.  That was thought impossible because there was only a jungle path, called the Kokoda Track, on which to travel and would be through some of the most forbidding terrain in the world.  \n\n\If their 12,000 jungle-experienced troops can do it, they will only have to defeat 1,200 inexperienced militia to seize Pt. Moresby.\n\nOnly some bombers and two inexperienced U.S. fighter squadrons of P-39s & P-400s are stationed at Pt. Moresby with which to save Australia.
