Description August 26, 1942\nBriefing at 0700 hours \n\nTO:  41st Fighter Squadron Commander\n\n\nAfter a lull in combat, the enemy has launched a two front attack against us.\n\nThey have sent troops from Buna by barge 190 miles east to invade Milne Bay.   They also outnumber our troops six to one at Isurava south of Kokoda and are now making their main assault there.\n\nTheir Zeros at Buna airstrip will be flying cover for both assaults.   Fly to Buna and attack them on the ground and those that get airborne.\n\nHalf your force of P-400s should strafe the AA while the rest concentrate on the enemy fighters.  After destroying these targets, attack targets of opportunity at the air field and nearby.  \n\n \nLt. Col. RICHARD A. LEGG\n35th Fighter Group\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
