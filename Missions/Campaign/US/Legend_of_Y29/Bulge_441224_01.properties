Name December_24
Short Tactical recce\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 24th, 1944\nTime: 0700hrs\nWeather: hazy, clouds at 1100m (3000ft).\n________________________________\n\nMISSION:\n\nChange of plan! Forget the patrol you were going to fly, the Thunderbolt group just requested a fast recon!\nThey need tactical information on which village to attack.\nBefore they fly off they'd like to know whether they must attack Checogne, Mande St. \u00C9tienne or Renaumont.\n\nFly to B1 NP9 and find out where the Germans are hiding their rocket launchers. \nPrimary target is to recon the right village. \nYou should fly at less than 1000m (3.000ft) to get a visual, yet high enough to evade small arms fire.\n\nYou have 15 minutes to recon the right village and radio the target to base as soon as possible.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n
