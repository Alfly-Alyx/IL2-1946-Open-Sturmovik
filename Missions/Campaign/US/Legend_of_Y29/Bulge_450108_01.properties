Name January_08
Short Scramble\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: January 8th, 1945\nTime: 1430hrs\nWeather: poor, clouds at 500m (1500ft).\n________________________________\n\n\nBackground:\nThe Luftwaffe used jets for surprise attacks on various targets, from late 1944. They never attacked in strength, even though enough planes were available, and their successes were usually rather small. \n\nHowever, where the Luftwaffe\u00B4s piston engined aircraft were often grounded by fuel shortages, the jets were still able to operate, using the lower grade fuel which was still available.\n\nThe Luftwaffe discovered very soon that the jets needed protection when taking off or returning to base; for this purpose, small patrols of low- flying FW190's were used.\n\nMISSION:\n\nScramble!! we're under attack yet again! \n\nObservers report jets approaching, but their number and direction are unknown! \nTake off immediately and patrol the area. Destroy those jets, even if it means a lengthy chase!\n\nGood luck...\n\n
