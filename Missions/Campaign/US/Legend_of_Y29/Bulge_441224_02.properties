Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 24th, 1944\nTime: 1230hrs\nWeather: poor, clouds at 1100m (3000ft).\n________________________________\n\nAs soon as the weather lifted, allied aircraft were back on the offensive. \n\nRAF 320 (Dutch) squadron, operating from Melsbroek since October 15th, were back in action on this day.\n\nAttention: loadout is unlocked.\n\nMISSION:\nIt's back to escort duty today. Take off and climb to 2000m (5500ft), vector 270, to pick up the Dutch Mitchells in A/B4. \nThe Mitchells will attack marshalling yards in F2. After releasing their load they will turn back for the front line via the shortest route, roughly vector 310-320. \n\nGood luck!\n
