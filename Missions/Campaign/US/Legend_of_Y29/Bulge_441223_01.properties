Name December_23
Short Supplies for the "town of NUTS" \n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 23rd, 1944\nTime: 0900hrs\nWeather: hazy, clouds at 700m (2400ft).\n________________________________\n\n\nBastogne gets surrounded after the 18th; numerous German attempts to crush the 101st airborne fail. \nGeneral McAuliffe's tactics are too clever to beat, and on December 22nd he tells von Mantteuffel's messenger "NUTS" when he gets summoned to surrender.\nOn the 23rd the weather improves and immediately an air bridge starts supplying the 101st and the 10th armored division. The siege of Bastogne continues.\n\nMission:\n\nThe weather has improved. \nPutting first things first, Allied commanders want supplies to be airlifted to Bastogne. We will cover the operation with 8 of our aircraft.\n\nTake off to the west, flying vector 270. You should be able to pick up the C-47s in A4.\n\nOperational altitude depends on the C-47's but it is expected that they will fly at around 2500m (8000ft). \nEscort them until they cross the line again. \n\nGood luck!\n
