Name January_06
Short Escort duty\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: January 6th, 1945\nTime: 1000hrs\nWeather: rain, clouds at 500m (1500ft).\n________________________________\n\n5 days before this mission, the original task assigned to 487 was escort duty; but the CO, Col. Meyer, traded that in for a patrol over the Ardennes. Little was he to know, that because of his decision, the `legend of Asch` came about. This mission, 5 days after that, represents the original mission that 487 was requested to do.\n\nEscort duty was among the chores that had to be done from tome to time. 487 took a fair share in these. Todays mission is no exception, your flight was assigned to a bomber box formation going into enemy territory.\n\nMISSION: \n\nATTENTION you have an air start!\n\nThere was no escaping this time; we have to fly as escorts for B17\u00B4s all the way to Germany. \n\nThe task is as usual: bring `em back alive...\nIf enemy fighters engage, make sure you do NOT follow them down! Stay with the bombers at all times! Keeping them away from the bombers is all you need to do.\n\nWe will be far into enemy territory. In fact, we will be using a Dutch airfield in use by 2nd TAF to land.  \nThis field is in A2. We will fly back to Asch tomorrow: but tonight, there\u00B4s a party at the RAF mess, don\u00B4t miss it!\n\nGood luck!\n
