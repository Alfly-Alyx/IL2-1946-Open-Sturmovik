Short Buzzbombs\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 15th, 1944\nTime: 1430hrs\nWeather: rain, clouds at 500m (1600ft).\n________________________________\n\nDuring the Arnhem operations and after, Antwerp was targeted by German V weapons. \nChasing them was restricted to zones outside the "FLAK BELT" which was off limits for obvious reasons.\n\nMISSION: \n\nYour flight leader wants you to chase doodlebugs today. He will fly cover while you try to bag a V-1!\n\nKeep your focus on the V1.The V1 has a vector of around 230-235 at 2000- 2500m.(6000- 8000ft) \nPick them up in F4 NP1 above their operational altitude and wait for one to launch. What you need to do to in this mission is "hidden" but the key word is survival. You have exactly one hour to score a "MISSION COMPLETE".\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: AS_P-51D_Generic_352FG-487FS.bmp\n
