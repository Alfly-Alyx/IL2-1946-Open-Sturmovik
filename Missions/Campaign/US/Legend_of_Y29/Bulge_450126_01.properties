Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: Jauary 26th, 1945\nTime: 1000hrs\nWeather: hazy, clouds at 700m (2500ft).\n________________________________\n\nThe battle of the Bulge is back where it started 6 weeks ago.\nGerman units are falling back to their starting line, without fuel for their tanks and no air cover to protect them.\nLosses have been appalling; some 30.000 US and 20.000 German soldiers have been killed. \n\nAny hope the Wehrmacht might have had of keeping the Soviet army away from Berlin has now faded.\n\n487 FS have played an important role in keeping the skies clean while the battle below raged; unknown to its pilots, high command consider this to have been instrumental. \n\nMISSION: \nWe have a rendez- vous over Houffalize with a squadron of P38's who will attack an enemy base. \n\nClimb to 2500m (8.000ft) and circle Houffalize until the "fork- tailed devils" turn up. Escort them to F3 and back to their base in A1. \n\nYou may have to assist in the airfield attack; do not leave the target area until everything is wrecked.\n\nYou have two primary targets: destroy ground and escort the P38's until they're home.\n\nGood luck!!\n \n
