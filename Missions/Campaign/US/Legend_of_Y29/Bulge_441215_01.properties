Short Airfield strike \n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 15th, 1944\nTime: 0900 hrs\nWeather: blind, clouds at 1500m (5000ft).\n________________________________\n\nDuring the build- up to the battle, many missions were about escorting ground attack missions. These were not without risk, as the AAA around German airfields was very dense and accurate. AAA shot down many a low attacker, especially if they were foolish enough to do more than one run. \n\nThe Luftwaffe, seriously hampered by fuel shortages, fly in small patrols above the build- up of armored divisions, which arrive by train.\n\nMISSION:\n\nAfter take-off, form up above the P47's that you will be escorting today. Mel Paisley and his 366 group will pay the Germans a visit on their airfield in F1.\n\nShould you get lost, it's vector 135 to target, and from there it's vector 320 to get back. \nOperational altitude is 2000- 2500m (6000- 8000ft) on the way there and 3000m (10,000ft) on the way back.\n\nStay well away from the Antwerp AAA belt (which is supposed to deal with the V1's in the area) around B2, C2 and C1. \nKeep this in mind when you encounter a V1.\n\nBy the way, good news: the depot will deliver your new P51-D today.\n\nGood luck! \n\nSkin:\nP51C_Metal_Blue_Nose_Post_Invasion.bmp\n\n\n
