Name January_10
Short Fast recon\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: January10th, 1945\nTime: 1445hrs\nWeather: good, clouds at 700m (2000ft).\n________________________________\n\nToday, we will fly a fast recon mission to identify a target for Mel Paisley's P47's. \n\nIt is said that the enemy is firing rockets from F2,  or Hosingen. These rockets, they say, cannot be intercepted once they've been launched. \nAn attack is needed to put an end to this! \n\nFirst, you will fly to Hosingen and find those rockets. We need an exact count of them. \nFly below cloud cover to identify the rocket site. \nYou will need to be low enough to see the whites of the enemy gunner's eyes!!\n\nThe "recon" target times out in 15 minutes. \n\nSecond, we need you back at base within 30 minutes for de- briefing and re-fueling. \nA second mission will be flown immediately after you get back, using P47's to obliterate the target, and we need you to escort them.\n\nGood luck!!\n\n\n\n
