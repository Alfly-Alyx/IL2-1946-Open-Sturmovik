Short Front line patrol\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 14th, 1944\nTime: 1700hrs\nWeather: blind, clouds at 1000m (3000ft)\n________________________________\n\nWelcome! \n\nYou have been assigned to 487 Fighter squadron. \nThis squadron belongs to 352 Fighter Group, based on Y-29, or Asch, a forward field very close to the Ardennes front.\n\nJust so you'll get used to things in Europe your flight leader will take you up for an easy patrol of the sector to the immediate east of the airfield. \nBecause this front has a terrible loss rate for rookies, you have not been given the latest aircraft type. Don't take it personal, just remember the next rookie will be here sooner than you think to collect it from you.\n\nMISSION: \n\nTake off and climb to 2500m (8000ft) in C3. Then vector 120 to E3 NP3; then cover D/E 3/4 completely. \n\nBe back at base  (C4 NP 8) within 30 minutes, this patrol is just to get you settled in-  you don't have a full fuel load.\n\nGood luck!\n\nSkin: \nP51C_Metal_Blue_Nose_Post_Invasion.bmp\n \n
