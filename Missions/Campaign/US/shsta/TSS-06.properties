Name The Shooting Stars - Mission 06
Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 06\n\nIntercept level bombers over Houffalize during the US Army assault on the city.\n
Description DIARY\n\nMarch 23, 1946\n\nWell the snow came sooner than expected!  Its a blizzard outside and the wind has picked up.  Its very cold...chilling to the bone.  We lost another few pilots today in our raids on the enemy airbvases.  Good men...good pilots...just unlucky I guess.  Everyone is wondering when this damn war will be over or when each of our numbers comes up and its our turn to die.\n\nI hear the scramble alarms going on now so I better find out whats going on.\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 15:30 hours\n\nWeather: Snowstorm, cloud base at 900 meters\n\nBRIEFING\n\nScramble alert.  We've got level or dive bombers attacking our Houffalize. With the onset of bad weather, the Army has managed to sneak in much closer to German lines without their artillery spotting them.  Our artillery is now staring their artillery down in the face and Sherman tanks are streaming in for the takeover.\n\nAll of this will be for naught if those bombers flatten the artillery positions.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Defend the artillery positions north of Houffalize\n- Destroy enemy bombers\n
