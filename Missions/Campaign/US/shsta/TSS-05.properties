Name The Shooting Stars - Mission 05
Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 05\n\nEscort Thunderbolts to attack the Luftwaffe on the ground.\n
Description DIARY\n\nMarch 23, 1946\n\nWe've got another clear day to operate in.  The weather is expected to get worse tonight so we're trying to get the squadron into action before things get worse.  We've been lucky, our loses have been light, and we've really taken it to the enemy.  The brass is pleased and the Shooting Star is living upto expectations...but the mechanics are still dealing with fuel line freezes and engine troubles under the cold weather.  Spring should be arriving soon...one can only hope.\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 11:00 hours\n\nWeather: Partly cloudy skies, visibility is starting to worsen\n\nBRIEFING\n\nThe whole of the 9th airforce is being mobilized today.  Earlier this morning, bombers from the 8th Air Force struck targets around Berlin, Frankfurt, and Bohn.  Damage to industry is reported as heavy but the bombers had a heck of a time dealing with the escorts.  Of the 120 B-29s sent into action, only 98 returned and many more were damaged.  In order to surpress further interceptor operations, the 9th airforce has been ordered on the whole to attack jet bases and destroy aircraft on takeoff or on the ground.\n\nOur duty is to escort Thunderbolts already enroute to targets at Hosingen airfield.  The Me-262's based there should be easy targets on the ground.  Mustangs have already shot up the field this morning in a armed recon raid and the flak and air defenses should already have been scattered.  We'll just be landing the crippling blow.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy enemy fighters (75%)\n- Escort Thunderbolts to the objective\n
