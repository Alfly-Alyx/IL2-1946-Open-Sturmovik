Name The Shooting Stars - Mission 11
Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 11\n\nThe war takes a turn in the Allies favor.  Strike the busy rail line before the Luftwaffe has a chance to strike back.\n
Description DIARY\n\nApril 28, 1946\n\nThere is a real sense of energy at the airbase now...or maybe thats urgency.  We've lost alot of pilots in recent weeks...flak, jet fighters, operational accidents.  One young lieutenant blew up on landing and there was nothing left.  Plane was shot to pieces anyways so its a miracle he even made it as far as he did.  Thats the reality we live with.\n\nThe war has turned in our favor.  After a year of stalemate in Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, we've pushed into Germany.  The Russians are now quickly closing the gap and the game is on to see who can reach Berlin first.  This has taken our operations to the heart of Germany.  Orders are coming up right now so we'll see what they hold.\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 08:00 hours\n\nWeather: Hazy skies, cloud layer at 1000 meters\n\nBRIEFING\n\nOur job for today is to fly long distance to the Berlin sector.  The target is a rail line near Potsdam.  We're to start at one end and fly to the other.  Destruction of vital supply trains is the goal.  Use of machine guns will be required as the ground attack conversion kits have not yet arrived for the P-80s.  We'll use speed to interdict the trains and leave the area before the Luftwaffe can respond.  If they do, we are to defend ourselves...but save our ammo for the trains.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy all the trains you can find along the rail route (100%)\n
