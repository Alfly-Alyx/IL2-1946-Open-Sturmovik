Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 10\n\nCrush the Luftwaffe in this sector once and for all.\n
Description DIARY\n\nApril 19, 1946\n\nThe weather has been bad again for a few days but things have cleared out.  The army is on the move again after consolodating their gains at St. Vith.  Only a few pockets of resistance still linger in our sector here in the Ardennes.  There's an increasing feeling of accomplishment in the squadron.  We've done alot to turn the tide in this area.  Victory appears at hand.\n\nSpring is apon us, the trees are green with buds, there are birds singing, and the airfield is starting to be a very lively place.  The squadron has been more jovial in the last few days than I have ever seen them before.  Hopefully the mood lasts and this war can be over.\n\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 1000 hours\n\nWeather: Clear skies, excellent visibility\n\nBRIEFING\n\nWith the takeover of St. Vith, Gouvy, Clervaux and several other minor objectives, the US Army has delt a stunning blow to the Germans.  They are reeling from the assault and beginning to fall back on all fronts.  Its now a matter of weeks before we may be knocking at the doors of Berlin.  The Russian front has seen some gains as well.  The pocket of resistance in Ardennes is about to fall.\n\nTo this end, all units are ordered to attack the last Luftwaffe planes in the air and on the ground.  Thunderbolts are striking the airbase at Merzhausen.  We are to provide support by taking out targets of opportunity.  Primary targets are aircraft in the air, but ground targets may be engaged too.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy any aircraft you can find (50%)\n- Defend the Thunderbolts as they attack the airbase\n
