Name The Shooting Stars - Mission 02
Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 02\n\nFly a patrol over Bastonge.  German jet bombers have been known to conduct daily raids.\n
Description DIARY\n\nMarch 17, 1946\n\nWe've been here a few days now and the squadron is settling in.  \n\nOur new Shooting Stars really made an impression on the veterans stationed here.  I think they are all warm at the thought that we finally have something to turn the tide with.  The Germans have been using jets for three years now and since the Ardennes offensive began, they have been using them in nearly every air operation.\n\nWe were not prepared for the cold however.  Its very cold...  Several Shooting Stars have developed mechnical problems.  The fuel lines in particular seem to pose some problems.  The mechanics are working on it now.\n\nWe've got more missions to fly...\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 11:00 hours\n\nWeather: Hazy skies, clouds around 900 meters\n\nBRIEFING\n\nIntel has mentioned that Bastonge is the daily target of German jet fighter-bomber attacks.  They zip and and zip out before Mustangs or Thunderbolts can dive to intercept.  The most common type attacking has been the Me-262...but several Mustang pilots reported a strange 109 variant that may also be at work.\n\nOur orders are to fly continous patrols over the area.  One patrol is about to depart the area due to a mechnical breakdown so we're up.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy fighter bombers (100%)\n
