Name The Shooting Stars - Mission 03
Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 03\n\nCombat Air Patrol over Houffalize.  Watch out for German jet interceptors.\n
Description DIARY\n\nMarch 18, 1946\n\nYesterdays combat with the German jet fighter-bombers was pretty intense but not as intense as I expect it to become.  We've got word that the Germans are planning an offensive in our sector. In anticipation of that, the army has launched strikes on Houffalize and other sectors nearby to try and weaken any possible future onslaught.\n\nTo make maters worse...the 'meto' people are telling us that the weather is going to get worse.  Much worse.  Snow storms at the end of March are expected.  We could be doing some rough flying soon.\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 14:00 hours\n\nWeather: Poor visibility, clouds at 1100 meters\n\nBRIEFING\n\nOur latest mission has just been decided on.  We're to fly a combat air patrol over Houffalize.  Army and paratrooper divisions are planning a retake of the city and they are launching a bombardment now.  The Luftwaffe may respond with bombers or their own fighter patrols.  Bandits could be coming from anywhere.\n\nPatrol at an altitude of 4500 meters or greater.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy enemy fighters (75%)\n
