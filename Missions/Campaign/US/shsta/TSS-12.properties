Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 12\n\nA final strike at the heart of the German war machine.\n
Description DIARY\n\nMay 1, 1946\n\nThe tempo of the war has increased in the last few weeks.  The army has made huge gains and both Prime Minister Churchill and President Truman are preparing the world for the prospects of peace.  The radio has been abuze with the reports of surrendering German units and crumbling leadership.  We only hope that the end comes soon!\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 15:30 hours\n\nWeather: Hazy skies, cloud layer at 1500 meters\n\nBRIEFING\n\nThe Mighty Eight has been preparing for three days to make this strike.  Long rang bombers and fighter escort will fly from bases in England to strike at Berlin and its industrial sectors.  The concentration of bombers will be immense.  Over 300 B-29 bombers will be involved.  The so called Superfortresses are going to make a final statement to the war effort.\n\nOur job is to fly interference for the tip of the bomber stream.  Mustangs will provide close escort while we'll intercept and attack any fighters that challenge us.  Any interceptors the Germans have left will surely be our targets.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Escort the B-29 formation\n- Destroy any fighters that attack the formation (50%)\n
