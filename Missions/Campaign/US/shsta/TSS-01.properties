Name The Shooting Stars - Mission 01
Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 01\n\nFly to your new airbase at Eindhoven.  The first of the frontline Allied jetfighters have been rushed to the front just in time to meet another German offensive head on.\n
Description DIARY\n\nMarch 15, 1946\n\nWe've been ordered to the front.  Dispatch handed me the orders just minutes ago.  We're to takeoff from our staging base here near Paris and head to Eindhoven near the Ardennes forest.  The Germans launched a counter-offensive in December of 1944.  For a year, they have been fighting it out over the same area with the front lines moving back and forth.  We've lost thousands and so have the Germans.  Neither side is ready to give up.\n\nThe Soviets in the east haven't faired any better.  The Germans put up a tough fight around Berlin and in the Kurland area.  Allied intel suggests the Soviets could be bogged down for many months.\n\nMeanwhile, the Luftwaffe has unleashed a new kind of hell on Allied pilots.  The jet fighters that numbered so few before are now common place.  Our Mustangs and Thunderbolts are hard pressed to catch them down low and our only successes have been up high.  Thats what my squadron is going to change.  We've been outfitted with new P-80 jet fighters.  Our boys call it the Shooting Star.  We'll see what it can do.\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 16:00 hours\n\nWeather: Excellent conditions\n\nBRIEFING\n\nOur orders are to fly to Eindhoven airbase at an altitude of 3200 meters (roughly 10,000 feet).  Once we reach Eindhoven and have made contact with the air traffic control there, we are to land our planes and get ourselves sorted out at our new base.  We're the first of what will be a hub of jet fighters to arrive here.  Hopefully we don't outstay our welcome with the veterans.\n\nWe've been told to keep an eye out for fighters or bombers.  I don't doubt it so we've got our Shooting Stars fully armed and ready to go.  Just in-case...\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Land at Eindhoven airbase\n
