Name The Shooting Stars - Mission 08
Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 08\n\nDefend the airfield from attack.  Bandits are inbound!\n\n
Description DIARY\n\nApril 14, 1946\n\nYesterdays fighting was intense on the ground and in the air.  We lost another couple of good pilots on combat air patrols and on escort missions.  The mighty eight is focusing their airpower on Berlin now.  I'm told by a couple of pilots at the pub that raids of 200 B-29 bombers or more are starting to become common.  There is a definate buildup in operations undertaken by ourside as we continue to edge forward.  The army took Gouvy and is driving towards St. Vith now.  If all goes well, we may be able to force a defeat of the German army in our sector soon.  The men are looking forward to victory...we know its there, we just don't know when and how many of us will live to see it.\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 1200 hours\n\nWeather: Hazy conditions, clouds at 1500 meters\n\nBRIEFING\n\nScramble!  Enemy fighter-bombers are inbound and are attacking the airfield.  We've got to get off the ground as quickly as possible before they can strike!\n\nA damaged B-29 reported the strike on their approach to the airfield so they may already be in trouble by the time we get our planes in the air.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Scramble and destroy as many attacking aircraft as possible\n- Return to base after the raid is over\n
