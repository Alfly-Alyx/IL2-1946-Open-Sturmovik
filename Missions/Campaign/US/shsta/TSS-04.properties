Name The Shooting Stars - Mission 04
Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 04\n\nIntercept German supply aircraft and shoot them down before they can land.\n
Description DIARY\n\nMarch 19, 1946\n\nThe squadron did well against the German jet fighters yesterday.  It appears that our Shooting Stars are a good match for the He-162s that we faced.  A little gloating and drinking was in order after that run.  Some of the guys are still sleeping it off...but with the stress that they are under, a little celebration now and then can't hurt.\n\nStill, the next mission is coming up tonight. A Luftwaffe supply run to one of their southern bases in this sector.\n\nOne of the veteran pilots from the Mustang squadrons tells me that its not the He-162s we should worry about.  He tells us that in Mustangs they were often able to surprise them and take them out.  What he feared that most was a new frontline weapon that some of the guys have nicknamed 'the Bat'.  We'll see what happens the next time we find one.\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 17:00 hours\n\nWeather: Clear skies\n\nBRIEFING\n\nThe weather has cleared and the Luftwaffe is expected to resupply this sector.  Our weather experts aren't sure how long these clear skies will last but it won't be for long.\n\nWord is that supply aircraft will be flying into Meinz.  We'll head them off and intercept the aircraft before they can land.  We're to watch out for escorts and raiders from above.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Destroy enemy transport aircraft (75%)\n- Intercept escorting fighters\n
