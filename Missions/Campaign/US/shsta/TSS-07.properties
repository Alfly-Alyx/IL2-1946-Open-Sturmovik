Name The Shooting Stars - Mission 07
Short The Shooting Stars - Mission 07\n\nTurn back a group of German tanks on the road to Houffalize.\n
Description DIARY\n\nApril 3, 1946\n\nWe've been out of action and out of the cockpits for a couple of weeks now.  The squadron and I were relieved to spend some rest and relaxation back in Paris while the weather was bad along the front.  Snow storms quickly turned to rain and the frozen fields have become muddy and impossible to travel.  But the weather is due to clear out and we've returned to our home at Eindhoven airbase.  Our Shooting Stars have been given a proper workover, we've gotten our replacement pilots, and we're ready to take the Luftwaffe on again.\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nTime: 0700 hours\n\nWeather: Poor visibility, low level winds and turbulance\n\nBRIEFING\n\nWe've got word that German army units are attempting to retake the road to Houffalize.  Since the capture of the city three weeks ago, the army has dug in and prepared for the worst.  They need our support to take these tanks out and we'll be giving it to them...with some help.\n\nThe French Air Force, with new planes and equipment, will assist us in this mission.  While the Thunderbolts are out of action, the French P-63s will take bombs and use their 37mm cannons to take out vehicles and tanks attempting to break into Houffalize along the road to Gouvy.  Our squadron will provide air cover and engage any jet fighters that cause them any trouble.  Our job is air superiority and not close escort so feel free to hunt fighters and other targets as they present themselves.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n\n- Escort French Air Force P-63Cs\n- Destroy enemy fighters (75%)\n- Ensure the destruction of Panzer tank group (50%)\n
