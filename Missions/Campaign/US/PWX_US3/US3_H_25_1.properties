Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 6th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nEtogi and Naura are cut off.\nBut the enemy forces are definitely weakened.\nOur landing at Wairopi forced the enemy to withdraw his heavy forces.\nAllthough the Etogi pocket is small in size, the local commander is optimistic to hold the village.\nThe same at Naura.\nThere the enemy encirclement will not be of a final quality. An attack from the south is planned and will be conducted tomorrow.\n\nThese good points at the Etogi front are shadowed by the estmated future of the Wairopi landing pocket. Even if the situation is satisfying at the moment the withdrawn enemy heavy forces will turn the tide in the next days.\nThe Yodda - Kokoda attack groups is meeting more and more resistance in front of Kokoda.\nThe Japanese managed to build up a well layed defense line in this short time.\nIf this group won't be able to break through to the Wairopi pocket, the airborne troops will have a hard time. \n\nIn the centre, the enemy is advancing with speed.\nArapara was invaded by the enemy and nothing seems to be able to stop him there.\nOur command's point of gravity is the Etogi front. That's why no more reinforcements can be spent to support the other sectors. Shall the enemy make gropund as long as Port Moresby is saved.\n\nToday a great number of air support missions are planned for the bomber and attack units.\nThe fighters are ordered to keep the air clean of enemy fighters.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep.\n\nTime: 07:10\nAltitude: 6000ft\nFlight: Unicorn- 3\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear. light morning haze.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
