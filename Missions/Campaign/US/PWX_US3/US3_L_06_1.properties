Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern Solomons\nGuadalcanal / Tulagi / Savo\nLunga Airbase.\n\nAugust 13th, 1943\n\n==================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe Yorktown is burning!\n\nThe ship was attacked from north.\nWhile the Yorktown's fighters intercepted enemy planes which were detected west of Savo Island, a group of very low flying B5Ns came through the islands northwest of Florida Island and attacked the Yorktown with bombs and torpedoes successfully.\n\nAt the moment the burning ship is trying to escape to the south but it's making only five knots.\n\nDuring the Yorktown Drama Guadalcanal was attacked at nearly all relevant places simultaneously. While you were fighting over the Yorktown Lunga was attacked by enemy Betties. Thank God without substantial success.\nOnly minutes before that our radar installations were attacked by other carrier airplanes.\n\nUntil now it is estimated that at least three enemy carriers are in the region. Unfavouritely none of the reconaissance flights came through.\n\nThirty minutes ago an enemy battleship group was sighted west of Cape Esparance. It seems that the ship group is heading towards our airbase.\nIf the ships come through, Lunga could be bombarded by these ships.\n\nYour squadron is assigned to escort B-24 bombers on their attempt to attack the enemy battleships.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nSecure the B-24 Bombers.\n\nTime: 06:45\nAltitude: 1000ft\nFlight: Pharaoh- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
