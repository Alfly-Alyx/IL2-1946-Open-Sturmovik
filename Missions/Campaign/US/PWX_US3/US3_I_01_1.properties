Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nOctober 24th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nQuiet times.\n\nIt's raining without interruption.\nThe front lines are stabilized. \nSince days no attacks were reported. Both sides seem to be satisfyied with their positions.\n\nIn the east the COBA- Line is a very well built defense line. Our ground troops are able to deliver supplies via the Collingwood Bay- Abau road to the front line which runs parallel to the road. \nA good position. \nThe Japanese supply line is very much hampered by the lack of a road. Only in the north and in the south the enemy is able to deliver his supplies over roads.\n\nIn the west the YEAK- Line is only randomly supplied by the road system for both sides.\nBig parts of the line can only be supplied by foot and muli- transport along bad ways through the dense djungle. These transports are difficult enough during the good weather period. At the moment, during the rain period the transports are exhausting nightmares.\nHowever, these circumstances affect both sides in the same way.\n\nAs the country, even the own one, can only marginally be controlled, both sides have started to bring commando troops behind their enemy's lines.\n\nThese small units are supplied by air. \nTransport planes are conducting occasional flights behind the enemy lines to drop off supplies. \nFloat planes fly deep into enemy territory to land on one of the many waterways to deliver men and material directly.\nThe bad weather with it's poor visibility gives them good protection against their opponent's fighters.\nThe transport airmen love the bad weather. \nThe fighter pilots hate it.\nBut fighter patrols over own territory must be conducted, at low altitude in rain and through dangerous winds.\n\nAlong the coasts of the mainland and the islands both sides are delivering supplies with ships and boats. Again the weather gives them very good protection against bombers. Here fighters have to fly patrols to probably find and attack the enemy's transport vessels too.\n\nAllthough the air war is somewhat pausing, the fighter airmen's life hasn't become much safer.\nWhen once the enemy fighters were the most dangerous threat, the terrible weather is threatening our pilots now and keep losses still high.\n\nNew Guinea is like a deadly monster. A monster made of earth, water, storms and lightnings.\nHow long can somebody survive this fight?\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nPatrol through river valleys and look for enemy activities.\n\nTime: 05:30\nAltitude: Very low.\nFlight: Ferrett- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nRain. Strong winds. Poor visibility.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
