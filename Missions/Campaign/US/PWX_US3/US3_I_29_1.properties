Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nJanuary 24th, 1943\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nOn the 19th our forces had a black day.\n\nOn an attempt to attack Goodenough with directly with naval forces, two battleships were sunk by the enemy. Although the enemy base at Goodenough had to take great losses the japanese were able to keep the base operational.\n\nThis happened at the same time when another drama took place here in front of Alola and Arapara.\n\nHere our ground troops were trying to take Alola since two days. \nAll heavy units were withdrawn from other front sectors to support a planned attack in the morning of the 19th.\n\nThen, in the same minute when our attack started the Japanese launched a very well prepaired assault on our defense line in the Rouna sector.\n\nAt the same time when our tanks were shot up in front of Alola the Japanese Army forced a retreat of our totally surprised forces at Rouna.\nOur attack at Alola had to be called off, to free heavy units for the defense of the Rouna sector.\nOur losses at Rouna: over 1400 men dead, missed, wounded or taken prisoner.\n\nDuring the night the reinforcements of heavy weapons from Alola managed to stop the enemy advance. \nRouna seems to be saved, but the frontline at Alola had to be withdrawn two miles south.\n\nIn only one day, our long time planned and well prepaired Spring Offensive to retake Eastern New Guinea was stopped by a resolute and quickly reacting enemy.\n\n\nA plane with a high officer coming from Australia is awaited. You were called to escort the plane to Wards Airfield.\nThere an Air Commander Meeting shall be held in the evening. You're invited to the meeting too.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nEscort the B-24 to Wards Airfield. After landing of the B-24, land at Wards too.\n\nTime: 18:10\nAltitude: 1000ft\nFlight: Ferrett-1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
