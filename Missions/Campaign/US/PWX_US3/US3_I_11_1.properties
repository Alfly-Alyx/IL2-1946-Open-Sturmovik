The psychological pressure inflicted by the numerous missions, by the permanent danger and fear is turning young boys into old men.\n\nNew Guinea changed you too. \nBut in another way.\nYou are becoming familar with the wild land. \nYou're feeling as you would become a part of the wilderness.  You're feeling like beeing a man of the stone age awaiting a ride on a metallic eagle.\nAre you getting crazy?\nYou're not sure, but you begin to love this archaic feeling.\n\nIn the morning the sky cleared up a little.\nIt's still raining but visibility is allowing missions again. \nBoth side's transports will get up again...\n\nFour PBNs are supplying a commando unit operating behind the enemy lines east of Jaure.\nThey are very close to the enemy fighter fields.\nThey'll need fighter cover to get up again.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFly to the PBN position and secure their taking off and escort them home.\n\nTime: 07:00\nAltitude: low\nFlight: Ferrett- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nRain. Poor visibility.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
