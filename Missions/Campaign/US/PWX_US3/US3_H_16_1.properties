Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 2nd, 1942\n\n================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nTwo days of rain hindered flight operations.\nThe airwar made a pause.\n\nOn the ground the enemy attacked and advanced.\n\nIn the western sector of the front the Japanese finally took Alola and pressed forward to Etogi.\nOn both sides of the village they bypassed our strongpoint and reached the flanks of Naura. We are holding the road between Naura and Etogi. Now the enemy has the opportunity to cut off Etogi.\nBut his supply situation seems to be bad. The Japanese shouldn't be able to deliver heavy supplies through the dense forest. So as long as we're able to hold the road open, we should have an advantage.\nSecuring the road and beating off the enemy attacks from our flanks are the most important operational targets today.\n\nSince the night the weather is clearing up.\nA flight of C-47s is ordered to deliver needed supplies to Etogi. You will have to escort them.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nEscort the C-47s\n\nTime: 05:50\nAltitude: 5000ft\nFlight: Unicorn- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny early morning. Fresh winds. Slight haze.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
