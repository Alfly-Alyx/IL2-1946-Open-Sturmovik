Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern Solomons\nGuadalcanal / Tulagi / Savo\nLunga Airbase\n\nAugust 15th, 1943\n\n=================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe Japanese are leaving the battlefield.\n\nFor Lunga the whole thing went not so bad.\nThe airfield is nearly unharmed. \nOnly two big hangars and a part of the barracks have been destroyed by the Japanese bomber attacks.\nAnd they had to pay a high price. At both attacks the enemy lost the majority of his attacking planes.\n\nOn the other hand we suffered heavy losses too:\n\nThe Guadalcanal Heavy Bomber Group lost 22 of it's 40 B-24s and in these minutes the group is just conducting another attack on enemy ships. Until this moment more than 160 men are dead or missing. 24 bombermen are wounded. And the just ongoing attack will produce more losses.\n\nThe two fighter squadrons here at Lunga had no more luck:\nAll in all Ary's 44th Fighter Squadron had to write off 12 of it's former 29 P-47s. The losses in men are not so high. Four are dead, two are missing and two are wounded. Four pilots had a better fate than their planes.\n\nYour squadron , the 44th, lost 15 planes from the former 28. Six men dead, two missing and three wounded are low losses for 12 destroyed planes. From these eight were shot down by the enemy , one fell victim to the Japanese bomber attacks and three P-38s were so badly shot up that they had to be written off after landing.\n\nThe battle was short and fierce, but for you at Lunga it went much much better than for the Navy guys.\n\nThe sinking of the Yorktown, the numerous attacks and air battles cost the Navy the majority of it's planes.\nThe losses under the dive- and torpedo bombers were terrible. Even the Navy fighter units lost more than the half of men and planes.\n\nOnly three days of battle.\n\n\nHalf an hour ago you were told that Lunga is awaiting a high visit:\nIt's no less than 'His Majesty' General Douglas C. McArthur himself who is returning from a visit at Hawaii.\nAt the moment he closing Guadalcanal and you're ordered to escort his personal B-24 to Lunga.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nMeet McArthur's B-24 over Taivu Point at an altitude of 1000ft. Escort him to Lunga.\n\nTime: 17:52\nAltitude:2000ft\nFlight: Pharaoh- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
