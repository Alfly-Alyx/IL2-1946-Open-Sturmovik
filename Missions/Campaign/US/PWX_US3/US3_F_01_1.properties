Your squadron was quickly reequipped with new men and planes.\nSince the few days of war on Wake you have a very different look on the young men who came to your unit.\nWith your six aireal victories you're a hero for them.\nYou're only thinking about the luck you had at Wake.\nMany died.\nNow you're looking on these young men and you're asking yourself who of them will have luck and who won't.\n\n\nLast month America's and Japan's forces met each other in the Coral Sea. \nBoth sides lost one carrier.\n\nOur intelligence is estimating that the Japanese Navy is planning to launch an operation against Midway. Admiral Nimitz ordered the remaining carriers to counter that threat.\n\nAll preperations were made when two days ago an American submarine spotted a Japanese Carrier Group near the Marianas on course to the south.\nTo counter an eventual threat at New Guinea or Australia,the Saratoga was redirected to the Coral Sea, where it shall form up with the Wasp.\n\nNow our force to guard Midway contains only two carriers: The Yorktown and the Enterprise.\n\nBut, will this guard really be needed?\nWith the sighting of the enemy carrier group sailing south it's very questionable that any Japanese naval forces are really on the way to Midway.\n\nYou're hoping that the Admiral is wrong.\nYou don't want to sit again on a small Island with no exit when the Japanese are about to take it.\n\n\nAt around 11 o'clock the group will reach Midway\nTraining flights are on the plan.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nTraining flight along the plotted course to the ships and back.\n\nTime: 08:00\nAltitude: 3000ft\nFlight: Bullfrog- 7\n\nWeather Forecast:\nStrong winds, hazy.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
