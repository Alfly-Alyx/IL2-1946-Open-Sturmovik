Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nNovember 13th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nMore and more commado activities behind our lines are reported. \nEvery day and night enemy float- and transport planes are flying into territory held by our troops. \n\nThese units are gathering informations and probably are prepairing attacks against our supply lines. \nAs long as the weather is so bad that the regular ground troops aren't able to conduct major operations, the commando activities keep mostly unrecognized. \nBut when the weather will clear up and ground operations will restart again, the enemy covert operations will come to effect. \nIt must be estimated that the enemy is aware of a great part of our preperations for the early 1943 offensive. \nThe Japanese must not be allowed to get a full picture of our troop's  organisations and deployment. Thats why the head command has to order low altitude search and destroy missions. \n\nThe dangerous weather circumstances have to be ignored. Losses through accidents have to be taken..\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nSearch for enemy air activity north of Port Moresby.\n\nTime: 09:00\nAltitude: very low\nFlight: Ferrett-1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nRain. Haze. Strong winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
