Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 4th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nAfter nightfall you were called to the briefing room again.\n\nYour last mission yesterday afternoon was the preparation for an upcoming major operation.\n\nThe reason for this operation is the desperate situation at the Etogi- Naura front.\nThere the Japanese can no longer be stopped if nothing happens.\nIf Naura falls the enemy will be able to cut off Loribalwa in a short time. Then he could attack Port Moresby coming along one of the flat river valleys.\nLoribalwa would be very much harder to defend. So the enemy must be held at least at Naura.\n\nOur Head Command has created a desperate plan to counter the Japanese advance at least temporary:\n\nBetween Wairopi and Kokoda the enemy supply line shall be cut off for some days.\nWe're awaiting a ship convoy with needed reinforcements and heavy weapons. Until then Naura must not fall.\nIf the enemy at Naura can't get supplies in a sufficient mass, Naura could perhaps be held. At the moment only we can use heavy weapons there, because the road is blocked at Etogi for the Japanese. As long as Etogi can be held by our troops, the Japanese have to attack at Naura with infantry only. These attacks can be beaten off by our heavy weapons.\nSo our Etogi troops need support. Support by cutting off the Japanese supply line.\nIf the road could be blocked west of Wairopi, the enemy's supplies wouldn't get through to Etogi and this would be the greatest help for our encircled troops in the village.\n\nNow the plan:\nAn airborne landing will be conducted in the early morning hours west of Wairopi. The airborne's task will be to block the Wairopi- Kokoda road.\nAt the same time an attack force starts to advance southeast from Yodda into the direction of Kokoda.\nThe force isn't very strong but we hope to get a way through to the airborne troops.\n\nThe enemy's main heavy forces are standing in front at Etogi. So if he want's to counter our landing and our attack from the northwest effectively, he will have to bring these forces to the airborne's landing zone. Then the pressure on Etogi would have been taken away.\nWould the Japanese keep their heavy weapons in front of Etogi, they would need much more time to open their supply line and their heavy forces would be weakened by a more and more worsening supply situation.\nHowever, a landing at Wairopi will bring us time. Time we desperately need to hold the enemy away from Port Moresby.\nOur airborne troops will be sent into a awfull situation. It only can be hoped that they will be able to break throug to our lines at the end of their mission.\n\nAt the end of the briefing you got the message, that the position you attacked yesterday was built up again by the enemy.\n\nAt 04:30, after a short night, you went to your plane.\nSince 40 minutes the air landing is running....\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nEscort a squadron of C-47 transports to their landing zone and back\n\nTime: 04:30\nAltitude: 7000ft\nFlight: Unicorn- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nNight. Fresh winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
