Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 7th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nIt's burning at all places.\n\nThe Etogi sector is stabilized but now the battle for the Wairopi pocket has become intense.\nThe airborne troops are beeing attacked from all directions.\nIt's only a question of time when the enemy will reopen his supply line and destroy the airbornes as a force.\n\nAnd that's not all:\nBecause all efforts were concentrated on the Etogi- Wairopi area, the centre enemy force was able to advance from Lauruni into the direction of Kalikodobu, taking Arapara on it's way. Now the enemy is standing only about 20 miles before the south coast. If the Japanese reach Kapa Kapa our land connection to the Milne region will be cut off.\n\nAt the moment Port Moresby seems to be saved, but at all other fronts the situation is becoming worse.\nIt questionable if the awaited reinforcements will be sufficient to throw the Japanese back.\n\nAt Arapara a strong enemy force was sighted, waiting to go into action. A good opportunity to hit the enemy before he can bring his power to the front lines.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nEscort a squadron of Marine- SBDs to Arapara and back.\n\nTime: 14:00\nAltitude: 9000ft\nFlight: Unicorn- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nWorsening. Strong winds. \n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
