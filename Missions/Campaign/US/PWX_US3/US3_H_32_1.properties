Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 10th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nDuring the night our long awaited reinforcements will arrive. \nThey are desperately needed.\n\nThe overall situation is not good.\n\nThe Wairopi pocket will make it only a few days.\nIn front of Kokoda the enemy is getting stronger. \nThe advance to make a connection with the airborne troops failed. \nThe encircled troops will have to break out by their own force. It's clear that a great number of them won't get out there.\n\nAt Etogi and Naura the picture is looking better.\nAllthough both positions are still encircled it can be hoped that their garrisons will be able to survive until the reinforcements come to the front.\n\nIn the centre the Japanese have reached Kalikodobu. At the moment our defenses at the place are holding the enemy's advance but it's clear that the resistance can't hold out for long.\nIt must be estimated that the Japanese will reach the coast at Kapa Kapa in the coming days.\nWhen this happens our thin line at the Owen Stanley Ridge must be withdrawn. Then the Japanese will have placed themselves between Port Moresby and the Milne Region.\n\nIn the east the situation is not more promising.\nOur troops at the Wanigela area will be cut off from their connection to Milne within the next 20 hours.\nAs many troops as possible are about to be withdrawn, but the door can't be held open for long enough. The Command is building up an evacuation plan to get out the men by sea ferry.\n\nThe majority of the fighters are ordered to support the airborne troops at the Wairopi pocket. \nOur transports are still supplying the men via the airstrip in the pocket. The losses are disastrious. Nevertheless the transport airmen do their duty with great braveness. The paratroopers need every box they can get.\nThe enemy must not be allowed to attack them from the air.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep.\n\nTime: 08:13\nAltitude: 4000ft\nFlight: Unicorn- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny, strong winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
