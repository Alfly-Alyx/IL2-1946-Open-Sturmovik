Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 18th, 1944\nTime: 2355hrs.\nWeather: hazy, clouds at 1500m (5000ft).\n________________________________\n\nRight from the start of the offensive, the Luftwaffe uses NSG units, or `NachtSchlachtGeschwader` to maximize the pressure on allied air force bases.\n\nIn this role, the Ju87 Stuka was used at night alsongside a variety of night fighters, light aircraft and reconnaissance planes such as the FW189. \n\nFlying under normal conditions had become almost impossible for the Stuka\u00B4s but the NSG role suited it just fine. \n\nMISSION:\n\nScramble! The air raid alarm has been sounded! \nIt\u00B4s one of those irritating night attacks again. Jump into your boots and get ready to take off into the dark... \n\n\nGood luck!!\n\n
