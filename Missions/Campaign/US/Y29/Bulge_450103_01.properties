Name January_03
Short Ghost plane chase\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: January 3rd, 1945\nTime: 1130hrs\nWeather: blind, clouds at 1000m (3000ft).\n________________________________\n\nAfter January 2nd, the garrison at Bastogne is no longer surrounded. Although German resistance is not letting up, there\u00B4s no stopping the American advance anymore. Supply columns get under way to the front, first of all to resupply the 101st `screaming eagles` airborne division.\n\nMISSION:\nOur supply columns are being attacked every time they\u00B4re close to Bastogne! Reports coming in fresh from the front speak of a `ghost` plane, a light aircraft that circles around for a couple of minutes before disappearing mysteriously from sight and from the radar screens... some 5 minutes later, the column will be attacked by other planes. \n\nSomething must be done about this! \n\nA duo of aircraft is to fly south to Bastogne and from there, follow the road to its northwest;  via C1 to B1, B2, A2, so roughly vector 310- 320. Stay below cloud, you will see nothing otherwise. \n\nFind that ghost plane and destroy it!\n
