Short The legend of Y-29\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: January 1st, 1945\nTime: 0920hrs\nWeather: poor, clouds at 1100m (3000ft).\n________________________________\n\nOn this day, the Luftwaffe mounts its last large- scale operation in the West. \nThe objective is to destroy as many allied aircraft on the ground as possible, and preventing the tactical support around the Bastogne pocket and elsewhere to be resumed.\n\nAfter pulling together some 1020 single- engined aircraft from all fronts, Goering decides the attack is to be flown on January 1st.\nAfterward, the Germans estimate to have destroyed more than 400 aircraft, but their own losses are well above 200, among which there were dozens of experienced leaders which could not be replaced.\n\nIt took the 2nd tactical AF about a week to replace all losses. The Luftwaffe never recovered.\n\nIn this mission the attack on Asch, Belgium, by JG11 is reconstructed. \nA flight of P47's led by Mel Paisley is just about to set course to the front, to attack German forces on the ground. John Meyer and a flight of P51's is taking off to meet the 109's which at 0920hrs appear out of the blue.\n\nThey have 20 minutes to destroy the Germans, led by G\u00FCnther Specht.\n\nMISSION:\n\nHAPPY NEW YEAR!\n\nMen, we were ordered to fly escort duty for the 8th, but the CO has used his influence and now we don't have to do that. \nThe old man had a hunch we're needed here, and now we're off on armed recon.\nWe are to fly a patrol in the area between the Bastogne front line and our base at 2000-2500m.\nKeep your eyes open for enemy intruders.\n\nGood luck!!\n\n\n\n\n\n
