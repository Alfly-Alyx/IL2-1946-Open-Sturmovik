Name December_17
Short Battlefield patrol\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 17th, 1944\nTime: 1000hrs\nWeather: poor, clouds at 900m (2500ft).\n________________________________\n\n\nOn December 17th alone, the Luftwaffe flies 600 sorties to support the onslaught by the SS panzer divisions. Allied fighter squadrons are flying patrols everywhere, almost tumbling over each other, adding to a general feel of chaos.\n\nWeather forecasts predict a sharp drop in temperature but this morning the weather is still suited for limited tactical support. \n\nMission:\n\nToday's first patrol is like yesterday's last, the only difference is serviceability today. We have 8 aircraft for armed recon. Cover the area between base and Bastogne flying at 2500m (8000ft). \n\nThe enemy is employing larger formations than those we have gotten used to, so if you engage in dogfighting keep looking around you.\n\nOther units in the area are british, you should expect encounters with Typhoons from 123 wing, or Tempests from 33 sqn.\n\nUse the last of the flying weather well, the next few days we'll probably spend on the ground.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n
