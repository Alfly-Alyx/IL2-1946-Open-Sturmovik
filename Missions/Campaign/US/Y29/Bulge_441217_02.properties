Short Bridge bombing\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 17th, 1944\nTime: 1500hrs\nWeather: snow, clouds at 600m (2000ft)\n________________________________\n\nTactical roles being carried out by medium bombers became more and more common after D- day.\nSeveral medium bomber squadrons were based in northern France and Belgium.\nRAF 320 (NL) squadron operated from Melsbroek in the Ardennes from October 15th, 1944.\nFlying the B-25, mostly targeting bridges and marshalling yards, 320 used Gee-H radar for a target fix. This enabled them to bomb under all conditions.\n\nMISSION:\n\nYou will fly in support of RAF 320 (Bomber) squadron today. The target is a bridge in E3; stay with the bombers until they're on the ground. \nIt is still snowing out there. Be careful to stay with your leader, you don't want to get lost in these conditions! \nShould you lose sight, climb until you're out of the clouds (that should happen around 2200m/ 7000ft) and look around you. The bombers will initially have vector 160 and they should climb to 3000m (10,000ft). From B1 the bombers will fly vector 60 and from E3 they return home on vector 300.\n\nTarget timeout is set to 22 minutes, which is when you're roughly above the front line on the way home. \n\nGood luck!!\n\n\n
