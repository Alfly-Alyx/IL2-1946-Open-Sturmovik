Name January_09
Short Front line collapsing\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: January 9th, 1945\nTime: 1500hrs\nWeather: good, clouds at 1100m (3500ft).\n________________________________\n\nAll along the front line the Allied counterattack is gaining momentum. \nFuel shortages have forced the Germans to abandon most of their tanks. The biggest single threat to the Sherman, the King Tiger, is out of action.\n\nIn absence of armour and fuel, what could German generals possibly come up with to stop the Allied advance?\n\nMISSION:\n\nWe will escort a single flight of P47's on an armed recon to D1/2. Reports suggest some well dug-in anti- tank guns are pinning down a number of armoured units in a village northeast of Longvilly.\n\nIf we don't clear the way for them, no- one will... the enemy is fighting tenaciously and we have to help those Shermans break through to Clervaux!\n\nWhile over the  target, take out the AAA and any soft- skinned vehicles if you need to. This mission will NOT be considered a success until everything is destroyed. \n \nGood luck!!\n
