Name December_28
Short Jackal jammin'\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 28th, 1944\nTime: 1030hrs\nWeather: Poor, clouds at 1500m (5000ft).\n________________________________\n\nIn 1944, a special RCM bomber squadron was formed within the 8th AF. RCM, or Radar Counter Measures, was new to the world, and top secret as a result. \nFlying from Oulton, missions differed depending on the purpose of the moment. Besides radar jamming, they also carried out "spoof conversation" missions, and "Jackal" missions, which jammed German armored unit radio traffic.\nOn December 28th and 31st, this squadron flew its only "Jackal" missions over the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nOther units were never informed of the purpose of these B24's, circling the Ardennes air for no apparent reason.\n\nMISSION: \n\nThe 8th has ordered us to fly an escort for B24's. They're not going to Germany for a change, so you'll be back before dinner.\n\nJust climb to 6000m (20000ft) flying vector 180. You should be able to pick up a 36 sqn Liberator which is cruising sectors B2, B3, C3, C2. \nRelieve their escort, who will return to base when you`re in position. \n\nYou will know when the B24's job is done, because in that case they will climb to 10000m (33000ft.) vector 300. Thats the cue for you to return to base. \n\nKeep that bomber in one piece!!\n\nPrimary targets:\n1) escort B-24 (times out when B-24 sets course for home)\n2) land back at base within 1 hour.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
