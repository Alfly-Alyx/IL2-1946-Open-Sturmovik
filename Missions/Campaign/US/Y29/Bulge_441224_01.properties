Short Tactical recce\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 24th, 1944\nTime: 0700hrs\nWeather: poor, clouds at 1100m (3000ft).\n________________________________\n\nMISSION:\n\nYour aircraft was readied for a patrol. But the Thunderbolt group need tactical information on which village to attack.\n\nThey will attack the German artillery which is pounding Bastogne from the northwest.\nBefore they fly off they'd like to know whether they must attack Checogne, Mande St. \u00C9tienne or Renaumont.\n\nFly to B1 NP9 and find out where the Germans are hiding their rocket launchers. Primary target is to recon the right village. You should fly low enough to get a visual, and high enough to evade small arms fire.\n\nYou have 15 minutes to recon the right village and radio the target to base as soon as possible.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n
