Short Ground attack in relays\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: January 2nd, 1945\nTime: 0830hrs\nWeather: hazy, clouds at 1000m (3000ft).\n________________________________\n\nAfter Bodenplatte, life goes on. The Germans are still pounding Bastogne and the Tactical support squadrons fly countless missions. \n\nMISSION:\n\nBusy times!! Some flights are already under way to the front. You must take off and fly south at about 1500m (5000ft.) to escort the Jugs. They will attack Longvilly in D1, where enemy tanks are waiting for their call to attack Bastogne. \nLet the Thunderbolts do the ground attacking! We know there's no enemy aircraft in sight today, but you can't be too sure. Besides, the FLAK there is killing. \n\nPrimary target is to escort the P47's until they're on our side of the "fence" in 35 minutes, and to land at base within 45.\n\nSome RAF Spitfires will be out there with us today.\n\nOnce again, good luck.\n\n
