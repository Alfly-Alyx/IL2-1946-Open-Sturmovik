Short Cover patrol over the fuel dump\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 23rd, 1944\nTime: 1600hrs\nWeather: hazy, clouds at 1500m (5000ft).\n________________________________\n\n\nThe Germans are advancing quickly. They are lucky to have bad weather to cover their armored advance. \n\nMission:\n\nWe have a small auxiliary fuel dump in A3 NP 6. \nThe squadron must fly a standing patrol to protect it. \n4 aircraft from "B" flight will patrol B3 and B2 at 1000m (3000ft) as safeguard against low- flying attackers, "C" flight will patrol the same area but they will fly at 2500m (8000ft) so they are above cloud. \n\nYou must be back at base within the hour.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n
