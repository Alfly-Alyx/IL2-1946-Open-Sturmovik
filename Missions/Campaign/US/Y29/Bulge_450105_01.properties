Name January_05
Short Strafing streak\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: January 5th, 1945\nTime: 1530hrs\nWeather: good, clouds at 1500m (5000ft).\n________________________________\n\nThe Germans are fighting rearguard battles to give whatever armour they have left a chance of falling back. They may have a fuel shortage, but they still have plenty of shells left for their howitzers.\n\nMISSION:\n\nOur tanks are advancing on Houffalize. The Germans are shelling the only road our tanks can take... and it\u00B4s up to us to do something about it. \n\n8 aircraft will form up over base before flying the short trip to C3 NP2. Fly low (1200m/ 3500ft) if you want to be able to see the field guns firing from across the river.  \nAttack until there are no guns left! \n\nBefore attacking the Howitzers, take out the AAA. \n\nYour weapons loadout is free, you could choose to take bombs with you.\n\nGood luck!\n
