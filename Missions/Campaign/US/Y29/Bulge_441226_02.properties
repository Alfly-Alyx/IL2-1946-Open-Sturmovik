Short Hosingen harrassed\n
Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 26th, 1944\nTime: 1730hrs\nWeather: Good, clouds at 1300m (4000ft).\n________________________________\n\nThe 4th armored division has reached Bastogne through a narrow corridor southwest of the town. They have brought their firepower and some supplies and the German attacks grind to a halt.\n\nIf the Americans want to prevent casualties, they should make sure the German assault force gets no supplies under cover of the night.\n\nMISSION: \n\nThe Germans have put in a tremendous effort at Bastogne and they will continue to do so, unless we destroy his supply columns tonight.\n\nThat\u00B4s why this mission has been timed in such a way that they are expected to start shifting supplies from Hosingen and Clervaux to the front, just when Paisley and his guys appear out of the blue.\n\nThe P47\u00B4s are already in the air, so take off immediately. \n\nPrimary target is to land at base before 1800hrs!\n\n\n\n
