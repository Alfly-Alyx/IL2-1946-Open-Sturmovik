Short No peace here\n
Description Description Asch, Belgium\n\nDate: December 25th, 1944\nTime: 1100hrs\nWeather: hazy, clouds at 1500m (5000ft).\n________________________________\n\nThere can be no respite for the aircrews, not even on this day.\n\nThe tip- and- run raids are most annoying. In this raid you simulate a decision to raid KG51's base using B25's. \n\nMISSION:\n\nAnother escort job, guys. It's the Dutchmen from 320 again, they're raiding the jet bomber base that keeps giving us a headache. \n\nTake off to the west, vector 270, to meet the bombers on their way. They will climb to 2500m (8000ft) and their attack will follow a prolonged shallow dive from D4 toward F3. \n\nAfter release the bombers will turn straight for home while climbing to 2000m (6000ft).\n\nKeep the bombers alive to win the mission.\n\nGood luck...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
