Name One week in May 1944- Thursday
Short One week in May 1944. Thursday. You must intercept a German recon aircraft and destroy it at its home base.\n
Description One week in May 1944. Thursday. The Germans have been fearing an invasion of Europe since 1943. With this fear came the ever increasing need for photo reconaissance of England to try and keep tabs on the Allied buildup there in preparation for invasion. Very few daytime flights flights have been possible since March of 1943 due to very strong British fighter patrols and standing fighter presence over all of the port areas. Even very high altitude attempts have been thwarted, and the Luftwaffe has had to have been satisfied with very few pictures of very low intellegence quality.\nToday a Bf 109 has sucessfully made a photo recon flight over Portsmouth harbor. The Area Controller of Nr 11 Group, Squadron Leader Eric Holmes, has studied the routing of recent Luftwaffe flights and reckons that this aircraft will return to its base just south of Bernay with its pictures. You and your wingman have been scrambled to fly on an important mission to intercept the 109 as it comes back to Bernay for a landing. I dont have to remind you that flak will be strong around the airfield. Keep it low and fast. If you do encounter enemy aircraft other than the 109, ignore them or run away. We must not let photos of Portsmouth get in to German hands!\n
