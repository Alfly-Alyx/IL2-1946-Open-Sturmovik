Description One week in May 1944. Wednesday. In the last two months, Allied heavy bombers have been smashing any and all targets that might be of aid to the Germans when the expected invasion of Europe comes. Airfields, coastal batteries and defenses, factories, railway marshalling yards and bridges have all been prime targets for this 'round the clock campaign. This morning you will escort the "big friends", B17s, to and from their target for today: the railway bridge just to the south of Caen.\nYou will join the bombers at an altitude of 4700m over the Channel. Weather over the Channel and the Continent is expected to be fair with clouds at 1100m.\nFlak defenses around the target area are expected to be quite stiff. Good luck up there and bring the "big friends" back home!\n
