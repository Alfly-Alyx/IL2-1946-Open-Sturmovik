Name Monday-Something's brewing. Low level recon.
Short One week in May 1944. Monday-You have been picked/volunteered to fly a low level, high speed photo recon run over the French coast between St Aubin-Sur-Mer and Pointe Du Hoc.\n
Description One week in May 1944. Good morning sir! So glad that you were willing to volunteer for this very important mission. It seems that the Germans have been reinforcing their defenses along the French coast. What we need is some low level photos to get an idea of what they're up to. The Underground has not been able to get very detailed information due to strict secrecy by the Germans near their coastal defenses. We do know that Fieldmarshal Rommel has been involved with directing their efforts. You will be flying a P51 photo recon aircraft this morning. No guns, but plenty of cameras and film. You will need to approach the coast  at low altitude and high speed. Your first photo target will be the north west side of the small town of St. Aubin Sur Mer. There the Resistance has reported a new HQ in a house on the edge of town. Tanks were reported there as well. Continue west along the coast and photograph any vehicle columns you encounter along the way. Your next important photo target is a German gun emplacement between Formigny and Port en Bessin. Again fly low so we can see exactly what is there. Your final and most important target is the gun emplacements and bunkers on the high ground at Pointe du Hoc. It is important that you stay low and move fast. AAA will be heavy. Your mission will not end until you have passed your final waypoint.\nAny questions? No? Excellent! I knew we could count on you.\n
