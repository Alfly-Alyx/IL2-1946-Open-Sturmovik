Name One week in May 1944. Friday
Short One week in May 1944. Friday. You have been assigned to attack Luftwaffe aircraft on the ground at the Carpiquet airfield outside of Caen\n
Description One week in May 1944. Friday. Today is going to be a day of intense, focused attacks on all Luftwaffe airfields in the coastal areas. Great numbers of Allied fighters and medium bombers will be sent out on this task. There have been some rumors that the Allied invasion of France is soon to come and your daily sorties acrosss the Channel would support this thought. You will cross the water with your section at approximately 2500m and then descend to 500m when you prepare for your attack.\nYour target for today is Carpiquet airfield outside of Caen. The Germans actually have aircraft on the field today. They have been hiding them in dispersals up to 5 Km away from the runways so we'll have a golden opportunity to take them out on the ground in the open.\n(Fly off the map to the north to consider this mission finished)\n
