Short One week in May 1944. Saturday-Assist a Coastal Command PBY that has damaged a U-Boat in the Channel and forced it to surface.\n
Description \u0020One week in May 1944. Saturday. You have just recieved orders to scramble immediately and fly due south over the Channel to assist a Coastal Command PBY. It and its wingman have just dropped depth charges on a U-Boat that was attempting the dangerous crossing thru the narrow channel. The U-Boat was hit during the dive and forced to surface. The Germans have recently greatly reinforced AAA defenses on the subs to counter the ever increasing threat from Allied aircraft. One of the PBYs was shot down while attempting to make another attack on the sub on the surface. The second has wisely chosen to stay just outside the range of the U-Boats guns and wait for assistance. \nYou and your squad will meet up with the PBY as soon as possible and drop your bombs on the sub and sink it. Keep your eyes open as you fly through the balloon barrage just before the coast.\n
