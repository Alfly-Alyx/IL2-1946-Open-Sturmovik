Name Tuesday-Fly a ground attack mission against a radar station
Short One week in May 1944. Tuesday. You will be flying with your section this morning to attack a German radar installation just to the south of Villers Sur Mer.\n
Description One week in May 1944. Tuesday-Our recon flights have located 46 long range radar sites operated by Jagdkorps II in our area of operations. These radars are of the "Wassermann" and "Mammut" types that have very narrow beams and are subsequently difficult to jam. You will approach the target from the northwest at approximately 500. You will be armed with 1000 lb bombs on this mission to do the most damage to these heavily fortified positions. For safety, you should put a 1-2 second delay on the bombs to give you a little more time to escape the blast. As witth your mission yesterday, you will encounter heavy flak. The Luftwaffe has been quite skittish about mixing it up with our fighters. The Germans have instead chosen to heavily reinforce their flak defenses in French coastal areas where an Allied cross-Channel invasion might occur. Intellegence estimates that there are over 10,000 flak batteries along the coast.\nAfter your attack on the radar station, you can make a short flight inland to look for other targets of opportunity to strafe.\n
