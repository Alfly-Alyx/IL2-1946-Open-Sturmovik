Description One week in May 1944. Sunday-Its been a very hard week but there will be no rest today. The USAAF and the Allies are keeping up the pressure on the Germans 'round the clock. You will be tasked with the destruction of two important bridges on the north side of the town of Quinville. You and your wingman will approach from the east at approximately 500m and attack the easternmost of the two bridges. Two of your squadron mates will be responsible for the second bridge. We also have a very fresh report from French intellegence regarding the recent arrival of a German train in Quinville. The resistance contact thought that the train might be off loading troops and armor. Take a low pass over the station in town and see what you can see. If that train is still there, do your best to disrupt or destroy it. Good luck.\n
