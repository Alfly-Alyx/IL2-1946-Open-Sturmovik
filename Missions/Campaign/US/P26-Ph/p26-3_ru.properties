Description December 10, 1941. \n\nYesterday was a day of grace, due to bad weather over Formosa - so the Japanese couldn't attack us att full power.\n\nBut now they are back. Most airfields have been hit again. Clark is a mess, so is Del Carmen, Iba and the Neilson Aerodrome. The US Far East Air Force has already lost more than half of all their planes... This looks BAD.\n\nBy the way: those fast and deadly maneuverable Jap fighters that you encountered the other day are called "Zeros" - avoid them at all costs!\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe know that the Japanese are landing troops up around Vigan. There is also reports of landings at Linguayen Gulf. If the last info is true we are really facing a crisis. We need to have this checked. Take a wingman and go and investigate.\n\nIt is imperative that you return in one piece, and are able to report. So avoid all dogfighting if you can!\n
