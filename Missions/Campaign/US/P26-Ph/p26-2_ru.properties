Description December 8, 1941. Noon.\n\nWhat a chock! That attack this morning at Iba came as a chock, even though it shouldn't have. The Americans lost a lot of P-40's on the ground, plus a number of their famous B-17's. In addition to this, more fighters were destroyed in a collision accident on the ground.\n\nAnd several of the other bases have been very badly shot up...\n\nPerhaps you heard: this morning the US air commander in the Philippines, Maj. Gen. Lewis H. Brereton, urged his superiors to launch B-17 bombing missions against Formosa, from which the attack probably came, but this was denied. This may very well prove to be a fatal error.  \n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe must help the Americans stop the enemy attacks. Japanese two-engined bombers have just hit targets south of Manilla, and you must try and intercept them when they are homeward bound. \n\nNormally these heavy bombers operate on altitudes we cannot reach, but due to the low clouds they are flying low. So there is just a chance that you might catch them.\n\nBut beware: they are probably escorted!\n
