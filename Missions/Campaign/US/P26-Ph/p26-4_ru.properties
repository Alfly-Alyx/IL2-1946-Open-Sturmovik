Description December 12, 1941. \n\nThe Japanese forces in the north are advancing, and now we have heard that there is yet another landing, at Lagonyo Gulf, to the southeast: some 2,500 men of the 16th Division, 240 km from the nearest American and Philippine forces.\n\nThis situation is getting more and more grim. \n\nThe Japanese air attacks continues, without pause. Most of the US air assets are knocked out. We in the 6th Pursuit Squadron have only some five servicable aircraft left.\n\nYOUR MISSION\nWe are to do a patrol towards Dingalan Bay. See if you can spot any incoming Japanese ships there. Avoid enemy fighters, if possible, attack bombers.\n\n************************\nDESIGNERS NOTES\nThis is the last mission in this mini-campaign. Thanks to Deutschmark (and the ones who helped him) for building the Boeing P-26!\n\n
