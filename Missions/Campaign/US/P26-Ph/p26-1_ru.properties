Description December 8, 1941. Dawn.\n\nWe have just received news that confirm earlier reports: Yes, war has come to the Philippines!\n\nAnd we in the Philippine Airforce will stand beside the Americans, against the Japanese aggressors. We in the 6th Pursuit Squadron (no, there aren't five more) are poorly equipped, with obsolete Boeing P-26's. But we won't go down without a fight!\n\nWe all suspected that it was coming, but... in this way. A sneak attack on Pearl Harbour - awful! And now we have just been reached by an report from one of the cities on the coast, that Japanese planes have bombed it.\n\nIn the harbour was the seplane tender USS Preston and it was attacked, and they also destroyed two naval PBY Catalina Flying Boats.\n\nTake a flight and scramble! Fly directly to the coast, see if you can catch any of the attackers and make them PAY!\n\n********************\nDESIGNERS NOTES:\n1. The Filipino 6th Pursuit Squadron was based at Batangos, but as there is no airfield at this location, Dinalupihan will do.\n2. To raise the cover over the sight, press Ctrl+D.\n3. Don't forget to switch skins, if you want to fly inte same camo as your wingmen.\n4. Special thanks to Deutschmark (and the guys who helped him) for buildeing the P-26!\n\n
