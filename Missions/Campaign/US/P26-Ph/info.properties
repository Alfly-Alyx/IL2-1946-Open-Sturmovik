Name Philippine Peashooter
Description December 8, 1941. War has come to the Philippines! Yesterday Pearl Harbor was attacked, and today the Japanese are on the move all around Southeast Asia.\n\nYou are a pilot in the small Filipino Airforce, in the 6th Pursuit Squadron, a unit equipped with obsolete Boeing P-26's. But even though the odds are against you, you won't go down without a fight - right?\n\nRegarding difficulty: Keep the "No Instant Success" OFF - the war goes on even if you fail your mission, right? In addition to this I strongly recommend that you also select the "No Icons" option. Regarding rank: start as "Captain".\n\nIMPORTANT: This campaign will only work if you have A.) The AAA Mod UI 1.1 installed, B.) The map over the Philippines by Delvpier, C.) And of course the Boeing P-26, made by Deutschmarks, and also available at www.allaircraftarcade.com
