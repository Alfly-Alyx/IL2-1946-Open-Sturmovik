Time of attack; 1620/I. Altitude 14,000 ft.\n\nD. I took off from Dulag strip 1450/I. as leader of Daddy Special flight on a fighter sweep to Mindoro beachhead.  I contacted controler and started to patrol.  At 1615 controler said that beach-head was being straffed.  At same time I spotted two boggies at 12:00 high.\n\nRichard I. Bong\nMajor Air Corps.\n\nUpon hearing the news of Dick's latest kill General Kenney sent word that he was to fly his P-38 to Tacloban and leave it there.  40 kills was enough.  It was enough and it was time for Dick "to go home while he was still in one piece, marry Marjorie, and start thinking about raising a lot of towheaded Swedes like himself."\n\nShortly before midnight on Dec. 29th, 1944 Major Richard Ira Bong boarded an Air Transport Command C-54 bound for the states.  Behind him lay two years of combat, over 200 combat missions flown over some of the toughest terrain in the world against skilled and ruthless opponents.  40 kills made him America's Ace of Aces.  In contrast the future was rich with promise - Marge, home and a career testing Air Force jet fighters lay ahead.  His future was so bright he had to wear shades.\n\nUse skin P38L-39 if you're almost there.\n
