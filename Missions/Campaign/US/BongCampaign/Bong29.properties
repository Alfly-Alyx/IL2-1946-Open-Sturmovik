Atltitude: 4,000 feet.\nElement leader of Daddy Green Flight.\n\nArriving over Ormoc Bay at 2:50 things were quiet over the American shipping at anchore.  The skies were clear of enemy aircraft for the first 10 minutes and then all hell broke loose.\n\n"I'm living with McGuire right now and so I'm not with my old outfit anymore.  Haven't had any mail for about six weeks except that one letter you sent to the 49th Group so I don't know much about what is going on back home.  The boys are receiving clippings back here so I see I'm spread all over the papers again...Would like to know what's going on back home and how badly the reporters are treating you all.  I'll bet you're both getting plenty of trouble from them.  I've heard vague rumors to the effect that I'm going to be decorated again so you know what that will be."  \n\n"Bad news.  I got into a poker game and lost $1500 before I knew what had happened.  Looks like my sins have caught up with me.  McGuire lost $2500 so the majors practically financed the game.  War is hell but poker is worse."\n\nUse skin P39L-36 unless you haven't kept up.\n
