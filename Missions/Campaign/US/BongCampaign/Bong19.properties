Name Catch Em If You Can
Short Bong and Lynch are sent on a mission to shoot down a Betty full of generals.\n
Description "In the afternoon of February 27 we picked up and decoded a Japanese radio message which gave the time of arrival at the Wewak airdrome of a transport plane carrying some staff officers from Rabaul.  By the time we got the information, it was almost too late for and interception, but we gave the information to Bong and Lynch, who hurriedly took off and flew wide open all the way, arriving over Wewak about two minutes before the Jap plane was about to land.  The inconsiderate pilot, however, was ahead of schedule, he had already landed, and was taxiing down the runway.\n\nThe score and the end of the attack was a major general, a brigadier general, and a whole staff of high ranking  officers." -General Kenney-\n\nGeneral Kenney tried to talk Bong into taking credit for a kill but Dick would have none of it.  In the Pacific theatre you didn't get credit for aircraft desroyed on the ground, only in the air.  Bong was asked "Maybe the plane's wheels had touched and it had bounced back into the air temporarily?'\n\nBong turned down the easy kill even though he was pressured to take it.\n\nUse skin P38L-Marge 22 for this one.\n
