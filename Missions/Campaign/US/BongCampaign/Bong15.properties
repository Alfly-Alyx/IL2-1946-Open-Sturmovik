Name Rabaul!
Short Attacking the bastion of Japanese strength in the South Pacific.\n
Description 9th Fighter Squadron, 49th Fighter, Group Army Air Forces,  APO 503\n\n29th of October, 1943\n\nMIssion:  Escort B-24s to Rabaul.\n\nAfter a little R&R in Australia Dick escorts an attack on Rabaul the main Japanese base in the South Pacific.  This is a tough nut to crack and will require superior flying.  The defenders are experienced pilots and know how to go for the kill.\n\nDick loses his wing man on this flight.  \n\nLt. Charles Mc Elroy who flew with Bong says "I can not imagine Bong being at fault for the loss of this wing man.  There was some gossip about his loss of wing men, but I did not know of any bitter feelings.  Possibly his superior ability as a pilot made it difficult for some to stay with him.\n\nBong's score is 19 after this flight.\n\nUse skin P38J-17 if you've earned it.\n\n\n\n\n
