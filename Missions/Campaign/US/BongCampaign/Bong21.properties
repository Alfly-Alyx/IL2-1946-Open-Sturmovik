Description HEADQUARTERS V FIGHTER COMMAND\nOffice of the A-2               A-2/RIB/wfm\n\n8th of March, 1944\n\nMission: Fighter Sweep\n\nSweep the area around Tadji.\n\nWith no air opposition Tommy Lynch and Richard Bong deside to straff some luggers escorted by a corvet of the shore of the Tadji area.  Tommy is hit and Bongs best friend is a memory.\n\nIn the space of a few minutes Fifth Air Force had lost one of its finest leaders and Dick had lost  a close friend. In the short time that Dick and Lynch had flown together a deep friendship and respect had grown between the two.  Of his old friend Tom Lynch, Dick would only remark that "losing Tom was just about the worst single blow I ever took while flying in combat."\n\nIt appears that one of the luggers was a flak ship and Dick's plane returned on one engine and had 87holes in it.\nCan you save Tommy?\n\nLetter home to Mom,\n\n"Didn't you know that I knew Lynch a long time ago?  I was flying on his wing the day I got my first flight and we just renewed old acquaintances. "\n\nTo be historically accurate use skin P38L-Marge25.  This was actually a mistake.  One of his kills was taken away shortly after this and called a probable instead.  He really only had 24 confirmed kills but was using this paint job for this mission.\n\n
