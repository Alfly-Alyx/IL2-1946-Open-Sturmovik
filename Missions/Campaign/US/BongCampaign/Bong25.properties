Description 9TH FIGHTER SQUADRON, 49TH FIGHTER GROUP\nARMY AIRFORCES\nAPO 72\n\nMission No. 342 27th October, 1944. 9th Fitron, 49th, Fitergp.11 P-38's.\n\nStrafe Lapdak and patrol Tacloban.\n\nTime of attack 1621/I Altitude 6,000 feet.  \n\nFour hours earlier 34 P38's of the 49th landed at Tacloban, Philippines. These were the first U.S. aircraft to land on Philippine soil since April, 1942.  General McArthur and General Kenney were there to greet them.  The last plane landed and a "short, stockey, towheaded lad" climbed down from one to the P-38s.  Dick had once again managed to wangle his way into combat!\n\nKenney yelled "Bong, come over here."  The kid came over and saluted, looking solemn and then grinned shyly as he saw McArthur standing there smiling at him."\n\n"Who told you to come up here?"  Kenney asked.  "Oh I had permission from General Whitehead", he answered.\n"Did he tell you that you could fly combat after you got here?" Kenney asked.\n"No." replyed Bong, "but can I?"\nEveryone laughed including Kenney who said "We are in such a fix that anyone could fly combat that knew anything about a P-38 and had one to fly.\n\nThe first few weeks after the invasion of the Philippines these P38s were outnumbered 10 to one and at one point they were down to just 20 pilots.  They recieved a bunch of replacement pilots with zero combat experience.  These pilots were told to get in there and hang on.  Men reported at 5:00 pm.  Their CO's never met them.  They were scheduled the the following morning and  went down in flames by noon in heavy combat losses over Leyte the same day.  \n\nUse skin P38L-30 if you dare.\n\n
