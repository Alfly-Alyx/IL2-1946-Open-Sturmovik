Mission No. 401.  80th Figher Squadron\n\n12th of April, 1944\n\nMission: Escort\n\nJoin a flight from the 80th Fighter Squadron and help out with escort duty.\n\nBong wins the race and is America's new Ace of Aces.  Not bad for a farm boy from Poplar, WI.  He is credited with 2 Oscars shot down for sure bringing his score to 27.  Bong claims a 3rd but no one saw his victory and his gun camera malfunctioned.  His description of the crash site is so detailed  that General Kenney promises to send down a diver,  when Hollandia is captured to find the wreck.  Later a diver does indeed find the wreck exactly where Bong said it would be and he is credited with kill number 28.\n\nLetter home to Mom.\n"I broke the record and by so doing procured for myself a lot of trouble, and besides that they have grounded me from combat flying.  I suppose that doesn't make you mad, but it certainly doesn't make me happy.\n\nI suppose Marge is catching hell, too.  I feel kind of sorry for her in this postion.  I wasn't thinking far enough ahead or I would not have put her picture on my airplane and she could have lived in peace."\n\nUse skin P38L-25 for this mission.\n
