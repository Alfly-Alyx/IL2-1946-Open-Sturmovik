Short Dick gets his 29th and 30th while "defending" himself. \n
Description October 10th \n\nMission to Balikpapan Oil fields on Borneo.\n\nEscort Bombers \n\n106 heavy bombers escorted by 36 fighters.\n\nGet the recon flight before it reports your raid !\n\nBong accompanies a raid on the oil fields to observe first hand the results of the gunnery instructions he had been giving since his return from his 2nd trip to the US on leave.  While conducting observations, he was forced to defend himself.  Even after 6 months away from combat, he is still America's leading ace. Tommy Mc Guire is still 8 behind the farm boy from Wisconsin.\n\nTalking to General Kenney about the gunnery course he took while back in the states, Bong states "Well, I know it is a good course and next time I'm going to try some long-range shooting, but today, just to make sure, each time i pushed the gun barrels into the Nip's cockpit and pulled the trigger.  I only fired two bursts, one for each Jap."\n\nUse skin P38L-28 for this one.  \n\n\n\n\n
