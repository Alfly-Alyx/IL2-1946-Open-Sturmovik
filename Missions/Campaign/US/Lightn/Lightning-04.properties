Short Lightning Strikes - 04\nBy IceFire\n\nBombers are heading for our positions.  Intercept and destroy.\n
Description DIARY - July 25, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nOur celebration after last nights tank busting operation was cut short by the sound of sirens and cannon fire.  The Bofors batteries setup at our base were active and the sound of German aircraft filled the skies.  No bombs landed at A-6 but we can be sure they will be back again soon.\n\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Intercept\nFlight Altitude: 3500m\n\nThe clearing weather this morning has not been the opening we were hoping for.   Radar in England is now detecting Luftwaffe bomber formations flying north towards the beaches and airbases that we've setup.  The harbour facilities and temporary airbases are all vulnerable to these bombers unless they are intercepted.  RAF squadrons have scrambled over Caen and its upto the 9th Air Force to intercept the bombers headed towards the peninsula.\n\nGet in the air, climb to 3500m and intercept the bombers.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Intercept bombers (50%)\n- Intercept fighter escort (50%)\n\n\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 0930 hours\nWeather: Good visibility, cloud base at 1400m\n
