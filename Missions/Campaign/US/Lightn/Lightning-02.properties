Description DIARY - July 24, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nYesterday we saw enemy action.  Some in our squadron shot up some vehicles south of Avranches.  The flak was all around us.  I was terrified and excited.  Our next missions will likely bring us more of the same.\n\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Strike\nFlight Altitude: 500-900m\n\nThe target for todays flight is south of St. Lo.  Recon has determined that a ammunition depot is located in the town of Torigny-sur-Vire.  Your orders are to fly to the target release your bombs and then return to base.  The flak on the second run is likely to be intense so you should make your pass and then head back to the clouds.\n\nMustangs from the 363rd  will provide top cover for the operation.  The Luftwaffe is expected to make a return to the skies as they have been moving reinforcements into the area.  Keep an eye out for them.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy the ammo depot south of St. Lo (100%)\n\n\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 1200 hours\nWeather: Poor visibility, cloud base at 1500m\n
