Short Lightning Strikes - 03\nBy IceFire\n\nA Sherman tank group has been pinned down by German tanks south of Carentan.  Fly out in the bad weather and destroy the tanks.\n
Description DIARY - July 24, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nThe flak keeps getting worse.  The Germans have set flak batteries up everywhere.  Along rivers, bridges, and especially around army dumps.  The Mustangs escorting us ran into a little bit of trouble with the Luftwaffe and we saw our first Focke Wulfs since we got here.  Very impressive aircraft to be fighting against.  Hopefully we don't see too many of them.\n\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Strike\nFlight Altitude: 500m\n\nThe weather has gotten worse and we're expecting ran and thunderstorms overnight.  Unfortunately, we've got an urgent dispatch from the army units south of Carentan.  Panzer tanks have been sighted moving in from the south and several Shermans have been caught on the road.  The Sherman crews have dug in but the Panzers have them pinned down.  We're going to take our eight P-38s and do whatever we can to stop those tanks.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy tanks (75%)\n\n\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 1700 hours\nWeather: Rain, cloud base at 900m\n
