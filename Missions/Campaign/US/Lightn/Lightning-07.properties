Short Lightning Strikes - 07\nBy IceFire\n\nConduct a fighter sweep over the Saint-Paul Luftwaffe base.\n
Description DIARY - July 28, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nThe liberation of St. Lo was a success.  The whole operating went quicker than any of us in the squadron expected it to.  Fighting south of the city continues but the army is now driving south west to Countances.\n\nEveryone is elated that we were able to assist those on the ground.  We hope to have the same chance again.\n\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Fighter Sweep\nFlight Altitude: 6000m\n\nWith the Army on the move to Countances and the liberation of St. Lo a complete success, our operations are shifting towards the south.  The Luftwaffe base at Saint-Paul has been the site of continual Luftwaffe operation despite our best efforts.\n\nB-17 raids are scheduled for later today and we expect that their activity over England will get the Luftwaffe back in the air.  Fly over Saint-Paul at high altitude and engage any aircraft you can find.  Spitfires and Mustangs will likely be patroling the same areas so keep an eye out for friendies.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy all fighters encountered (50%)\n\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 1500 hours\nWeather: Poor conditions, cloud base at 1200m\n
