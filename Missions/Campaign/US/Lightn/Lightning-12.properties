Name Lightning Strikes - 12
Short Lightning Strikes - 12\nBy IceFire\n\nBattle of the Falaise Gap.  German units evacuating must be crushed.\n
Description DIARY - August 17, 1944\n\nDear Mom,\nI'm sorry its been over a month since I last wrote to you.  The squadron has been so busy and we've been so heavily involved with the fighting in the air that I haven't had a chance to finish this letter.\n\nThe Germans are retreating.  Many of their units are surrounded by the combined strength of the Allied armies south of Falaise and north of Argentan.  We're expecting the call any minute now to scramble our fighters to attack the retreating vehicles.\n\nI'm due to return home for leave as they rotate new pilots onto the frontlines.  I'll hopefully see you soon!\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Ground Attack\nFlight Altitude: 1500m\n\nThis is it pilots.  We're heading out to Falaise.  The Germans are in high retreat.  They are leaving behind guns, tanks, and burning vehicles and our jobs are to make sure that they leave as many burnt out hulks as possible.\n\nThe Luftwaffe has been reduced to a non-existant force and our own fighter-bombers now rule the skies.  Your greatest enemies will be flak.  Keep an eye out and attack your targets.  The air will likely be filled with Allied aircraft so keep your wits about you!\n\nGood luck.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy all vehicle convoys encountered (75%)\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 1545 hours\nWeather: Good visibility, cloud base at 1500m \n
