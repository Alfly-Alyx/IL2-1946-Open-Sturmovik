Description DIARY - July 26, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nWe lost pilots and planes yesterday.  More friends than I care to write about.  Although the replacements have already arrived and the squadron is still operating at strength, the impression made by the Luftwaffe's bombers and fighters on us is one that I will not soon forget.\n\nThe army is making a move toward St. Lo and our jobs will be to disrupt the Germans when that happens.  Meanwhile, the battle for Caen continues but with no noticeable success at the moment.\n\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Interdiction\nFlight Altitude: 1000m\n\nGentlemen, the the Army is making a move for the city of St. Lo.  When this happens, they will need all the luck and help they can get to push the Germans out of the city.  To do this, all of the tactical air force squadrons are on duty to attack trains and vehicles in the southern areas to slow or stop their efforts to resupply the front lines.\n\nGerman rail tends to move by night and this evening is likely to be no different.  Watch for trains with mounted AA guns as they will cause you the most trouble.  Fly the rail route between Coutances and Villedieu.  Destroy any trains you see and avoid contact large concentrations of flak.\n\nGood luck!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy all rail traffic encountered (75%)\n\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 1700 hours\nWeather: Clear skies\n
