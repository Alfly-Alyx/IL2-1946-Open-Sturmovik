Name Lightning Strikes - 10
Short Lightning Strikes - 10\nBy IceFire\n\nDestroy the V-1 Launch Rail.\n
Description DIARY - August 14, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nThe 367th FG has moved to a new base and we've been out of the action for a few days now thanks to the move.  Our new base at A-2 makes our old field look like luxury.  A-2 is overgrown with little in the way of amenities and the nearest town, Grandcamp-les-Bains, is not an easy place to reach.  The crews are working overtime to keep the dust out of the engines.\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Strike\nFlight Altitude: 3500m\n\nI hope everyone has a restful night in our new accomodations.  They aren't much but they will do for now.  Our next mission is a strike against a "No-Ball" target.  Yes these are the V-1 launchers that you may have already seen before.  Recon has discovered a pair of V-1 launch rails that must be destroyed.\n\nOne flight of P-38s will fly to the target and destroy it.  The flak positions are unknown but they are likely to be light so as not to draw attention to their position.  Good luck!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy V-1 launch rails and facilities (75%)\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 0545 hours\nWeather: Thunderstorm, cloud base at 900m \n
