Short Lightning Strikes - 09\nBy IceFire\n\nAttack the Saint Paul Luftwaffe base.\n
Description DIARY - July 30, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nEverything is happening very fast now.  We haven't been told the latest news but the last we heared was that the Army had moved into Avranches.  Yesterday morning we were flying over enemy held territory and now it is ours.  I worry that we may be overconfident and that the Germans are holding something in reserve but we haven't seen anything to suggest that.  Victory may come soon...then we can all go home.  Those of us left...\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Strike\nFlight Altitude: 1500m\n\nPlanners have suggested that now is the time to deal a fatal blow to any remaining aircraft at the Saint Paul airfield.  The facility has been bombed several times from higher altitude and then attacked again at low altitude by fighters but this time we're going in for the kill.\n\nThe 367th has been called into action to strike at parked and moving aircraft on the base itself.  We'll be walking into the brunt of any flak at the base which is why we're not going in alone.  The Eight Airforce will be backing us up on this one with B-17s that will bombard the field.  P-47s from the 366th will also help us with flak supression.\n\nBe aware of the attack timing.  The B-17s should be bombing the airbase at roughly the time that the P-47s and our squadron arrive.  If the base has not been bombed when you arrive give it a wide berth as the B-17s will be leveling much of the place and I don't want to see any P-38s damaged by our own bombs.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy parked aircraft, vehicles, and planes at the Saint Martin airbase (75%)\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 1400 hours\nWeather: Clear skies\n
