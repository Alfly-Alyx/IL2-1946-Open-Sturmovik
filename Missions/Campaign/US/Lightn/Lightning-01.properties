Description DIARY - July 23rd, 1944\n\nDear Mom,\nMy adventures with the 367th Fighter Group have begun in earnest.  Although the past month has been exciting, we've move onto a new stage in our operations, and things are bound to get interesting.\n\nWe've setup shop at our new airbase on the continent.  Its been given the glorious name of A-6 and its going to be our new home for a couple of months.  A-6 is near Quineville.  I'm not sure if you can find that on a map somewhere but its a very nice little French town right on the coast.  We're looking forward to sampling their wines and visiting the place.  Although its not in very good shape thanks to the invasion, the people are very friendly.  I guess they are glad out be out from under the boot of occupation.\n\nThe war continues and we've got a job to do.  I'll write again when I can.\n\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Armed Recon\nFlight Altitude: 1000-1500m\n\nGood morning gentlemen.\n\nThe temporary airstrip A-6 is our new home.  Get used to it and settle in.  It may not be pretty but it should help us get the job done.\n\nThis morning we'll be flying to the western port city of Avranches.  Our mission is to sweep the area for fighters, bombers, vehicles, tanks, and other other types of enemy activity.  Our goals are to disrupt enemy communications and prevent their ability to move troops and supplies to the front.  We'll fly in two flights of four fighters to the area and back again.  Do not linger over Avranches as the flak is bound to be heavy.  Keep an eye out for the Luftwaffe, they may be scarce but they aren't invisible just yet.\n\nIntelligence reports that the French resistance have damaged one of the major bridges in the area.  There may be a backlog of German troop and supply vehicles moving in from the south.  Keep an eye out and consider that area your primary target.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Fly an armed recon patrol to Avranches\n- Destroy targets of opportunity and then return to base\n\n\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 1000 hours\nWeather: Good, cloud base at 900m\n
