Name Lightning Strikes - 11
Short Lightning Strikes - 11\nBy IceFire\n\nFinal fighter sweep to crush the Luftwaffe.\n
Description DIARY - August 15, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nWe've been told that the Luftwaffe is in taters with very few aircraft left in the area.  They haven't been seen very often and we've been told that the majority of their crew and aircraft have been withdrawn to defend Germany from invasion.  We'll meet them soon enough.  Meanwhile, the war on the ground near our base has continued and we're expecting a climax very soon.\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Fighter Sweep\nFlight Altitude: 6000m\n\nOrders from HQ.  We're to fly a fighter sweep over Falaise and Argentan.  The last of the Luftwaffe fighters are defending this airspace and we want to eliminate their ability to operate by drawing them into a battle and destroying them.\n\nBombers from the RAF will be flying a sortie over the area and will draw the enemy up.  Your job is to cut them out of the sky.  Good luck!\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy all fighters encountered (75%)\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 1230 hours\nWeather: Poor visibility, cloud base at 600m \n
