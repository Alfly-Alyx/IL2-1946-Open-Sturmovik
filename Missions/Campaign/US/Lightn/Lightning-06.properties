Short Lightning Strikes - 06\nBy IceFire\n\nLiberation of St. Lo!\n
Description DIARY - July 27, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nThe army is moving on St. Lo.  The liberation of another French city is under way and our enemy continues to fight us to the last.  Hundreds of tanks and thousands of soliders on either side are once more charging into battle.  Our P-38s are being readied by the ground crew and we're about to take our planes back into the fight.\n\nIts not what I thought it was going to be but we'll see it through to the end.\n\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Attack\nFlight Altitude: 2000m\n\nThe Battle of St. Lo has commenced.  Several hundred army units are now converging and fighting inside the city.  The 9th has been busy taking the battle to the skies.  We haven't seen much of the Luftwaffe and that has given our fighter bombers the opportunity to strike at the enemy tank formations.\n\nOur job for this mission is to fly south of St. Lo and attack any Panzer divsions that may be attempting to reinforce the garrison at St. Lo.  Make sure you check who you are shooting at as our units are spread out over the entire area.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy Panzer tanks south of St. Lo (50%)\n\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 0800 hours\nWeather: Hazy conditions, clouds at 900m\n
