Short Lightning Strikes - 08\nBy IceFire\n\nDestroy artillery and V-1 facilities in the south of Normandy.\n
Description DIARY - July 29, 1944\n\nDear Diary,\nYesterday saw some of the most impressive aerial combat since I arrived here in France.  Planes from both sides were falling from the sky and we lost some good pilots.  The enemy paid dearly and the Luftwaffe is now reeling from the continual fighting with our planes.  We continue to see them but in dwindling numbers.\n\nThe Army continues its drive southward with increasing speed and I expect that we won't be staying at our current base for too much longer.\n\nBRIEFING\nMission: Strike\nFlight Altitude: 1200m\n\nThe liberation of St. Lo and Coutances has come with an impressive pace as the Army traces the roads south into the heart of German controlled territory.  French resistance fighters continue to make their lives difficult and the momentum of the advance has quickened considerably.\n\nOur next mission is two fold.  Flight one will fly to an area just north of Avranches and destroy a fortified artillery base along the road.  When the Army arrives we don't want them to have to fight their way through this post.\n\nFlight two will fly to an area just east of Avranches near the town of Brecey.  A V-1 launch site has been discovered and it needs to be destroyed quickly.\n\nThunderbolts from other IX Command squadrons will be flying flak supression in the area.\n\nOBJECTIVES\n- Destroy artillery fortification (75%)\n- Destroy V-1 launch site (75%)\n\nCONDITIONS\nTime: 0630 hours\nWeather: Good conditions, cloud base at 600m\n
