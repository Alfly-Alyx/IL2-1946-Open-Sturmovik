Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern Solomons\nGuadalcanal / Tulagi / Savo\nLunga Airbase\n\nAugust 15th, 1943\n\n=================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe Japanese are leaving the battlefield.\n\nLunga had luck.\nThe airfield is nearly unharmed. \nOnly two big hangars and a part of the barracks were destroyed by the Japanese bomber attacks.\nAnd they had to pay a high price. At both attacks the enemy lost the majority of his attacking planes.\n\nOn the other hand we suffered heavy losses too:\n\nThe Guadalcanal Heavy Bomber Group lost 22 of it's 40 B-24s and in these minutes the group is just conducting another attack on enemy ships. Until this moment more than 160 men are dead or missing. 24 bombermen are wounded. And the just ongoing attack will produce more losses.\n\nThe two fighter squadrons here at Lunga had no more luck:\nAll in all Willard's 7th Fighter Squadron had to write off 15 of it's former 28 P-38s. The losses in men are not so high. Six are dead, two are missing and three are wounded. Four pilots had a better fate than their planes.\n\nYour squadron , the 44th, lost 12 planes from the former 29. Four men dead, two missing and two wounded are low losses for 12 destroyed planes. From these eight were shot down by the enemy , two fell victim to the Japanese bomber attacks and two P-47s were so badly shot up that they had to be written off after landing.\n\nThe battle was short but fierce.\nFor you at Lunga it went much much better than for the Navy guys.\n\nThe sinking of the Yorktown, the numerous attacks and air battles cost the Navy the majority of it's planes.\nThe losses under the dive- and torpedo bombers were terrible. Even the Navy fighter units lost more than the half of men and planes.\n\nOnly three days of battle.\n\n\nWe just got a message from our observation post at Cape Esperance:\n\nTwo Japanese destroyers were sighted.\nYou want to attack them...\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nAttack the enemy ships with bombs and rockets.\n\nTime: 17:52\nAltitude:2000ft\nFlight: Pyramid- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
