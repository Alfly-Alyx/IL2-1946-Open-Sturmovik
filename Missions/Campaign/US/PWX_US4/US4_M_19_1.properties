Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nGoodenough, Ferguson, Normanby.\nCollingwood-, Goodenough-, Milne Bay.\nEastern New Guinea.\n\nSeptember 27th, 1943\n\n===================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nOne of the biggest fighter battles of New Guinea has ended.\n\nIt raged the whole morning long. \nAlone on our side  over 350 sorties were flown by all five fighter units of the Milne Bay Air Groups's fighter squadrons.\n\nOn the first sight this seems not all too many, but what makes this number so special is, that all these 350 sorties met the enemy. Everybody who took off this morning knew that he will surely fight Japanese fighters.\n\nLosses on both sides were huge.\n\nThe Milne Bay Air Group lost 51 fighter pilots dead. 7 airmen are missing, 10 wounded. 60 fighters didn't come home.\n\nEverybody is shocked.\nEightysix dead or missed pilots in less than four hours!\n\nThe Loss Reports sent to the Air Group Command are giving a depressing picture.\n\nThe 44th FS at Garuahi lost 12 of 21 planes and 10 of 25 pilots.\nYour 7th FS lost 11 of 22 planes and 9 of 26 pilots.\nThe Marine's VMF-113 lost 8 of 16 planes. 8 of 18 airmen died.\nThe RAAF's Spitfires from Sagari lost 12 of their 20 planes with 10 out of 24 airmen dead.\n\nThe70th FS suffered the most:\nWith 17 from 20 planes shot down and 14 pilot losses out of 22 the squadron was nearly wiped out.\n\nBefore the battle the Milne Bay Air Group commanded exactly 99 operational fighters manned by 115 fighter pilots.\nLess than four hours later only 39 fighters were left operational with 64 airmen still alive and unharmed.\n\n60 planes and 51 pilots lost!\n\nOver 150 aereal victories were claimed by our pilots. A number which can't be true, as the Japanes didn't have more than 100 to 120 fighters on hand before the battle.\nIt's surely more realistic to cut this number by 75.\n\nMany more men are dying on the Baniara peninsula.\n\nOur forces are making some progress. They are standing right in front of the building site of the Baniara / Bibiwa port and airfield.\nSince our advance from the south the enemy has begun to supply his forces from the north.\nThe supplies are landed from ships to the beach between Sirimo and Woruka.\n\nIt would be of great worth if the enemy supply line could be cut. The enemy freighters are good targets...\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nAttack the enemy ships with bombs and rockets.\n\nTime: 18:50\nAltitude: 4000ft\nFlight: Angel- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nWorsening again. Strong winds.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
