Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nTarawa Atoll...... March 18th, 1942\n\n==================\n\nSITUATIONAL REPORT:\n\nThe day yesterday brought no decision. \nBoth, Tarawa and the Enterprise Group were attacked two times. So was a Japanese carrier group which was detected about 400 miles southwest of the island.\n\nSlowly we're getting a clearer picture of the battle and the enemy forces. \n\n\nThere are reports from the second raid against the Japanese battlegroup saying that a second carrier arrived in the afternoon. ID- markings on planes which attacked the Enterprise in the evening seem to confirm this. \n\n\nOur forces have lost many planes.\nBetio Airfield was badly hit by two enemy air raids. \nBut fortunately the airstrip is still operational.\n\n\nThe Enterprise was damaged too.\nIt was hit by one bomb and one Torpedo.\nBut thank god the ship was never in danger to be sunk.\nIt had great luck.\nUntil today's morning the repairs were brought to a state where the ship is operational again.\n\nOur forces are weakened but ready for a second day of battle.\n\nBoth sides will have to reconnoitre the position of the opponent's carrier group.\nThis is the time for forward fighter area control missions to interrupt the enemy's reconnaissance.\n\n\nMission orders:\n--------------------\nForward Fighter Air Control.\n\nTime: 07:31\nAltitude:  15000ft\nFlight: Caesar- 2\n\nWeather forecast:\nOvercast, very strong winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++\n.\n
