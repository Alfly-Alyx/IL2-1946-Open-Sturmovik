Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern Solomons\nGuadalcanal / Tulagi / Savo\n\nAugust 15th, 1943\n\n=================================\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe Japanese are back!\n\nFifteen minutes ago the Essex Group was attacked by an enemy carrier borne air raid some seventy miles south of the island. Thank god the attack wasn't that successful, although the Essex suffered light damage.\n\nA force of two enemy battleships is beeing observed to close to the southwestern coast of Guadalcanal. Right in front of our radar- and observation post.\nSouthwest of that position a Japanese carrier was just sighted steaming east, covering the battleship's operation.\n\nThe Lexington Group has passed Savo Island north and is just about to prepair an air raid against the enemy carrier group.\n\nThe Lunga Air Group was ordered to deal with the enemy battleship group.\nTwo air raids are about to be conducted.\nThe first raid shall be conducted by heavy B-24 bombers  which are ordered to attack at low altitude.\nThis will hopefully draw down the enemy fighters.\n\nThe second raid, planned to be conducted by the remnant dive bombers from the Yorktown Air Group will attack the battleships from high above. Hopefully without beeing intercepted by enemy fighters at that altitude.\n\nYour squadron is assigned to the first raid.\nTo the heavies.\n\nOk, let's go.\nAttack all enemy fighters you encounter.\nDon't let them shoot down the B-24s.\nHave you seen the bombermen?\nThey're full of fear.\nShow them that you're there.\n\nToday you're not only responsible for your men, but for the poor bomber airmen too.\nHow many will come back?\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nEscort the B-24s at all cost.\n\nTime: 08:38\nAltitude: beside the bombers.\nFlight: Pyramid- One\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny with strong winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
