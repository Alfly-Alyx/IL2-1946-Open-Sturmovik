An all out assault was beaten off in the morning with the use of the last reserves. But every enemy attack at Etogi will make the Japanese supply situation worse.\n\nNow our airborne troops have to be supported at all costs. Our ship convoy is on the way. \n \nIn these minutes our airborne troops managed to establish a provisoric runway in the western part of the landing zone. This enables the transports to fly in supplies which can't be dropped off.\n\nThe first C-47s have landed just  15 minutes ago.\nAt the moment they're beeing unloaden.\nSoon they will have to take off again.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep\n\nTime: 08:14\nAltitude: 7000ft\nFlight: Griffin- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny morning, strong winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
