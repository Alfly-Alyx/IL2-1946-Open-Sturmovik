Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nSeptember 12th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe Japanese opened a corridor to their troops in the centre of the Wairopi pocket.\n\nSince one week this small contingent of infantry was able to hold it's position against all American attacks.\nAll fightings in the pocket demonstrated the difficulties which modern military forces have to encounter when fighting in dense forests.\n\nSince the time, when Arminius beated the mighty Roman Legions in the dense forests of Germania, forest- war is writing it's own rules:\nHand to hand combat. Visibility ranges less than 30 yards. Invisibly defenders. Attackers of company size running in ambushes layed by only a handful of men.\n \nWhen the fights start, the opponents are so close to each other that heavy weapons can't be lead and can't be used without hitting own men.\nThis leads to the paradox situation that even a well equipped attacker, nominally superior in firepower, is suffering from a lack of firepower.\n\nSo it was possible that only about 120 men were able to hold the forest against a far superior opponent. \nSo it was possible that the Japanese couldn't be destroyed in the Wairopi pocket forest and so it was possible that the American infantry could hold the Etogi- Naura- position.\n\nNow the Wairopi pocket is falling. \nWhen the airborne troops are wiped out south of the Wairopi- Kokoda- road the Japanese will have reopened their supply line.\nFrom then on, the paratroopers will only have to fight for their naked lifes. For a break out to their own lines.\n\nThey'll need our air support.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nSearch and destroy enemy ground units.\n\nTime: 06:10\nAltitude: 7000ft\nFlight: Griffin- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny early morning.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
