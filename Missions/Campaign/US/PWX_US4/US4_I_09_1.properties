Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nDecember 7th, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe attacks on the enemy radar installations failed. \nAgain the enemy was well prepaired. \n\nThe bombers had to take great losses. \nMorale is down. \n\nThe fighter's fate wasn't much better. \nAllthough the enemy had to take great losses too, he was very effective in defending his bases. \nYou and your comrades have to fly those low altitude patrol missions daily. \nOften fighters are falling victim to the horrible weather conditions. \n\nWhen a pilot is able to bail out, he's far from beeing saved. If he had to bail out over the jungle, he often lands with his chute on one of the high trees. \nThen it's very difficult to reach the ground. \nThere is hardly any help for him. \nIf he isn't able to get down alone, he will have to die hanging on a tree. \nLonesome. \nForgotten.\nFar from home. \nAnd even if he should reach the ground unharmed, he is far from beeing safe to make it home. \nThe jungle is a hostile world. Finding the way isn't easy. \nThere are so many pilots who were last seen hanging on their chute. \nThere are so many who didn't ever came home; \nSo many missed.\n\nThe Japanese are supplying their troops with ships anchoring in the Collingwood Bay. \nA good target, the commander said.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nAttack the enemy ships with bombs and secure the SBDs.\n\nTime: 13:42\nAltitude: very low\nFlight: Angel- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nRain, rain, rain.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
