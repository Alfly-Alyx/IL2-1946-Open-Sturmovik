Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nJanuary 22nd, 1942\n\n==================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nA catastrophy on the sea!\n\nThe whole battleship- bombardment operation of the enemy Goodenough Airfield is leading to a total desaster:\n\nAllthough the Japanese were taken by surprise when the ships started to bombard the enemy airfield, the Japanese managed to fly many planes out unharmed.\n\nRight in the first 20 minutes one of our destroyers was sunk by enemy fighter bombers. Then two battleships were hit. Allthough not critical, the hits hampered the battleships fire control.\n\nAt 03:30 the ship group left the Goodenough area.\nThe enemy airfield was badly hit and showed heavy destructions and several big fires.\nAll looked satisfying.\n\nBut then, twenty minutes ago, another air strike against the battleships was reported.\nThis time one of the heavy ships was so badly hit, that it was immobilized. \nHeavy fires are raging and the crew is fighting against the fires.\n\nThe rest of the group is steaming south to evade any further enemy air attacks.\n\nNow the crippled ship is alone....\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFly to the damaged battleship and secure the airspace over it.\n\nTime: 04:55\nAltitude: 800ft\nFlight: Angel- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nClear night.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
