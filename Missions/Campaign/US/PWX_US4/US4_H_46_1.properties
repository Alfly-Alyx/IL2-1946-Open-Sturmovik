Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nOctober 3rd, 1942\n\n=================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe air war is pausing.\n\nThe permanent rainfalls and thunderstorms hinder air operations totally. \nThese conditions will last at least until january.\nBoth sides are resupplying their air groups.\nTime for refreshment after the exhausting weeks you survived.\n\nSince the end of August, when your squadron was deployed to Port Moresby with 18 planes and 20 pilots, your unit lost 27 planes destroyed and 19 pilots  dead or missing. \nOnly seven of the airmen you arrived with in August are still alive.In only 46 days you had to fly 142 missions where you encountered the enemy 39 times.\nWithout permanent reinforcements in men and material your squad would have ended to exist.\nLosses of this degree had to be suffered by all air units here in New Guinea.\nAnd it's not very satisfying that your opponent had to suffer equal losses.\n\n\nThe war on the ground is going on. \nBad weather or not.\n\nThe Japanese have started an offensive to take away the whole centre of Eastern New Guinea.\n\nBetween the line Arapara - Kapa Kapa in the west and the Abau - Collingwood line in the east the enemy is attacking at two places:\n\nA western Japanese attack group is advancing  along the road Kalikodobu - Abau and an eastern attack group is attacking along the Embeso - Abau- Road.\nOur whole central forces are in danger to be encircled.\n\nThe Head Command has planned a controlled withdrawal from the centre region to the east.\nThe Japanese shall be held between two main defense lines.\nIn the west the line is going along Yodda, Etogi, Arapara and Kapa Kapa. \nIt was given the name 'YEAK- Line'.\n\nIn the east the defense line is planned to be built up a few miles west of the Abau- Collingwood Bay road, named 'COBA- Line'\n\nBoth lines could be supplied relatively easy, much better than the Japanese could supply any attack forces to overwhelm the two.\n\nThis all will need air support.\nBut the strong winds and the bad visibility makes it impossible to identify and to hit enemy ground units.\nAt these conditions nothing more than bomber attacks at medium to high altitude can be conducted.\nSo the fighter units will have to conduct high altitude patrols during the rain period.\n\nToday no plane took off until now.\nSuddenly an officer came to your barracks:\nEnemy bombers on the way!\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nTake off immediately and secure the airspace over Port Moresby.\n\nTime: 18:52\nAltitude: 12000ft\nFlight: Griffin- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nRain. Overcast. Very strong winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
