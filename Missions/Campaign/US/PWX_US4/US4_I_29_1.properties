Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nJanuary 23rd, 1942\n\n==================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nYesterday was a crazy day.\n\nIn that early morning a battleship group was ordered to prepair the Goodenough Island for a landing.\nThe gunfire of the battleships destroyed a great part of Goodenough Airfield's installations.\nBut although the runway must have been hit too, the Japanese managed to bring planes in the air very quickly.\nWith these planes, just in the first hour, the Japanese succeeded in sinking one destroyer and damaging two battleships. \nWith the first light the battleships were attacked by Japanese bombers coming from Buna. \nAgain one of the battleships was hit by a bomb but stayed operational.\nThis attack lead the head command to the decision to withdraw the ships.\nOn their way back the group was attacked again.\nThis time one of the heavy ships was immobilized. Within only 30 minutes this unit was sunk by a further air raid. \nOver 2300 men sunk with their ship.\n\nIt took not very long until the rest of the group was attacked again.\nA second battleship had to take three torpedo hits in the bow. \nAlthough seriously hit, the ship was still able to steam south at lower speed, but the fire in the foreship grew.\nWhen the group passed the Milne Cape, the fire fused a serious of explosions in the first turret which affected the function of the boilers. \nWith it's last speed the ship made it to a position close to the southern beach of Cape Milne.\n\nAgain a battleship was immobilized.\nAnd again it took not much time until the Japanese attacked and sunk the ship.\nOver 900 men dead.\nFortunately many were able to rescue themselves to the Milne Cape beach.\n\nAt this time it was clear that it would be suicide to bring a landing fleet to Goodenough. \nThe plan was abandoned.\n\nNo objective of that day was achieved.\nThe battleship's first objective, to interdict air operations from Goodenough prior any attempt to land there wasn't achieved.\nAt no time the airfield was inoperable.\n\nThe enemy's Goodenough Commander quick and resolute order to immediately launch as many aircraft as possible, brought him the victory.\n\n\nIn the west another drama took place at the same time.\nThere our ground troops were trying to take Alola since two days. \nA great part of the heavy units from other front sectors were withdrown to support the planned attack on Alola in the morning.\n\nThen, in the same minute when our attack started the Japanese launched a very well prepaired assault on our defense line in the Rouna sector.\n\nAt the same time when our tanks were shot up in front of Alola the Japanese Army forced a retreat of our totally surprised and only light equipped forces at Rouna.\nThe attack on Alola had to be called off to free heavy units for the defense of the Rouna sector.\n\nOur losses at Rouna: over 1400 men dead, missed, wounded or taken prisoner.\n\n\nDuring the night the reinforcements of heavy weapons from Alola managed to stop the enemy advance. \nRouna seems to be saved, but the frontline at Alola had to be withdrawn two miles south.\n\nIn only one day, our long time planned and well prepaired Spring Offensive to retake Eastern New Guinea was stopped by a resolute and quickly reacting enemy.\n\nAt the moment it's unclear what will be done in the coming time, but the Offensive is stopped.\n\nA look at the losses is horrible.\nTwo battleships and two destroyers sunk.\nAt least 3600 seamen dead.\nHundreds are still in the water, waiting for rescue.\n\nAll in all over 35 planes were lost on all fronts. The only good point is, that the Japanese lost many more.\n\nThe attack at Alola cost the Army 27 tanks and over 1800 troops dead, missing, or wounded for the benefit of nothing.\nAdded to the 1400 men lost at Rouna, it must be called a defeat.\n\nNot one objective was achieved.\nGoodenough and Alola will stay in Japanese hands and the enemy came closer to Rouna.\n\nAt the moment it is discussed, whether the 8700 men landing troops for the taking of Goodenough will be sent back to Hawaii or whether they will be used to reinforce the Eastern New Guinean Forces.\n\nStill seamen are in the sea waiting for rescue, where the first battleship sunk.\nJapanese pilots who were able to bail out are there too.\nBoth sides are agreeing that rescue boats, unweaponed ships and floatplanes shall not be attacked today to give them the opportunity for rescue.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nPatrol the rescue area. Make only use of weapons  for your defense\n\nTime: 07:00\nAltitude: 3000ft\nFlight: Angel- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nClear morning.\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
