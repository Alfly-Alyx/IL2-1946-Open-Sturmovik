Admiral Nimitz ordered the carriers on hand to sail to Midway to counter that threat.\nAll preperations were made when two days ago one of our submarines spotted a Japanese Carrier Group near the Marianas on course to the south.\nTo counter an eventual threat at New Guinea or Australia, the Saratoga was redirected to the Coral Sea, where it shall form up with the Wasp.\n\nThe forces are split up. Yorktown and the Enterprise are patroling near Midway since several days.\nNow all are waiting for the enemy.\nToday the carriers will come to the island....\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nPatrol flight.\n\nTime: 08:00\nAltitude: 3000ft\nFlight: Bronco- 5\n\nWeather Forecast:\nStrong winds, hazy.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
