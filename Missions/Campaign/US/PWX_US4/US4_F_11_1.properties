Description ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nMidway Islands / Kure Atoll\n\nJune 6th, 1942\n\n==============================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nTwo sad news within only one hour!\n\nColonel Baldwin, your squadron's commander is dead.\nDuring your last fight defending Midway against an enemy raid Jay was shot down by a japanese Zero at very low altitude and crashed.\nYou had to take over the command of the squad.\n\nThen right after your landing you recieved the message that the Yorktown was sunk!\n\nIt took too long to get a good picture of the enemy forces. Only in the last 20 minutes the long awaited messages of spotted enemy carrier groups came in.\n\nOne carrier lost, Midway hardly hit. \nOur situation is critical. \nNow we have the opportunity to beat back. \n\nThe enemy forces consist of three carrier groups:\n\nIn the north an enemy group around the Hiryu and an unidentified light carrier attacked the Enterprise group in the morning. One of it's attacks sunk the Yorktown.\n\nIn the south, west of Midway an enemy carrier group around the Shokaku was attacked by the Midway Air Group in the morning two times. The light carrier which was part of this group is reported to be sunk.\nThe Shokaku is estimated to be damaged.\nAt the moment this group is sailing west.\n\nNow a third enemy carrier croup was sighted north of the Kure Atoll. It is formed around the Akagi and is consiting another light carrier.\n\nThis third group shall be attacked from the Midway Air Group now.\nIn these minutes the Enterprise is launching two attack waves against the northern Hiryu Group.\n\nThe decision will be made in the next two hours.\nIt is essential that enough enemy forces will be damaged or destroyed to make a landing at Midway impossible.\n\nThe next raids will turn the tide or lose the battle.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n----------------------\nEscort the bombers on their raid.\n\nTime: 14:15\nAltitude: 9000ft\nFlight: Bronco- 13\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
