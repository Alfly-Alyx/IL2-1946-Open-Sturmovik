Description +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nEastern New Guinea\nBuna / Port Moresby / Milne Bay / Goodenough\n\nAugust 24th, 1942\n\n================================\n\n\nSITUATION:\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Forces are attacking in strength.\nOur defense lines are light and often unconnected to each other.\nThere is too much, mostly unpassable land for the few Allied troops.\n\nThe Japanese are advancing with three forces simultaniously:\n\nThe strongest, western group is attacking on the shortest way from Buna to the southwest, into the direction of Port Moresby itself.\nHere the Japanese Army has reached the village of Wairopi in the night. Hard fights are raging around the small spot. The important road crossing at Kokoda and Alola is in danger and with it the only road connection to the northwest.\nPort Moresby would be cut off from the only landway to the west of New Guinea.\n\nThe second, central Japanese group is advancing south, along the road Natungo- Jaure. The village of Jaure is short to be reached.\nFollowing this road to the south coast, the Japanese could cut of Port Moresby from the Milne Region.\n\nThe third Japanese advance is moving along the northern coast to the east. The light Allied forces along the coast won't be able to offer more than a symbolic resistance. Not before the Japanese forces reach the Goodenough Bay an organized defense line can be established.\n\nAllied reinforcements are on the way but won't arrive before September 10th.\n\nUntil then the Imperial Japanese ground forces have a 2 to 1 superiority in numbers against the defending Allied ground forces.\n\nThe situation in the air is somewhat different. \nHere the Allies allocated a sufficient number of additional air units to the airfields at Port Moresby in a very short time.\nNow both side's air forces are roughly equal in strength.\nAnd fighters are dominating the scene.\nAny movements on the ground are hindered by the bad passability of the terrain. Even the shortest distances need much time to be covered. So, for the ground soldiers the Owen Stanley Ridge seems to be huge. \nNot so in the air:\nA whole airwar is to be fought in an airspace not much greater than hundred miles in square.\nHard times for bombers. They nearly everytime meet enemy fighters, no matter which side.\n\nAttack planes and bombers can only be used with strong fighter escort. And nearly everytime such air raids are met by strong opposite's fighter patrols.\nThen the battle begins. The attackers try to hit their targets. The attacked side hastily launches more and more fighters to counter the attack.\nIt takes not too long until the attacked side has more planes in the air than the attacker.\nQuickly the attacker becomes the defender, trying to secure the return of the ground attack planes or bombers and not at least trying to return itself safely.\nOften long air battles emerge from those situations. Then the losses are high for both sides.\n\nA dive bomber attack against an enemy artillery position in front of Wairopi is ordered.\nTo secure the attack fighters have to enter the area agressively.\n\n\nMission Orders:\n---------------------\nFree Fighter Sweep over the SBD's target area.\n\nTime: 06:40\nAltitude: 3000m\nFlight: Griffin- 1\n\nWeather Forecast:\nSunny and clear. Weak winds.\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n
