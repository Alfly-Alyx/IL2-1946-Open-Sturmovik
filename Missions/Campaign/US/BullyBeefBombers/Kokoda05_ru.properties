Description 21st Troop Carrier Squadron\n----------------------------------------\nMission #122  - Kokoda CasEvac\n----------------------------------------\n0635 November 4th 1942\n----------------------------------------\nWeather - 10/10, Rain, thunder\n----------------------------------------\n\nOK Yank, we're sorry to have to make you do this, but if those blokes aren't back in Moresby within the next couple of hours, some of them are going to die.  I know I wouldn't squeeze my socks out in this weather, but well, we drew lots fairly and you're the one who was chosen.  Besides, it serves you right for not bringing our smokes.  \n\nYou'll just have to get over the mountains whichever way you can and carry those boys with you.  You'll need to land at 5-mile, where the field hospital is.  I guess you can take any route you want....\n\nThere'll be a cold beer ready for you back in Darwin for this, I can tell you.  We won't forget you, surely we won't.\n\n\n
