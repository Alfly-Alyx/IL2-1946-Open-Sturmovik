Description 21st Troop Carrier Squadron\n----------------------------------------\nMission #119  - Kokoda Landing\n----------------------------------------\n0635 Novemember 3rd 1942\n----------------------------------------\nWeather - 5/10, Moderate breezes\n----------------------------------------\n\nBriefing - It's a fine beautiful morning isn't it?  I like this time of day, just before everything starts to stink.  Remember it's a good thing that Kenney makes us wear these long pants.\n\nThe Australian 16th Brigade have re-taken Kokoda, and re-established the rough strip outside the village.  You will take these fine gentlemen bully beef, cigarettes and a modest supply of alcohol.  Remember not to let Kleeman see the cigarettes before you take off.  You won't be flying over the Diggers this time, so if you disappoint them it's your problem, not theirs.\n\nProceed by the allocated route.\n
