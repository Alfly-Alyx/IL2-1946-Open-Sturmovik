The Diggers have found some live ones, and boy, they sure are angry.  You're on the scheduled re-supply to Missima.  You'll be carrying ammo and probably diapers.  Look out for low-trajectory Jap mortar fire and light artillery pieces.\n\nProceed as per the allocated route.  Remember to reduce your mixture at 7000 feet if you don't want to leave a smoking crater.\n\
