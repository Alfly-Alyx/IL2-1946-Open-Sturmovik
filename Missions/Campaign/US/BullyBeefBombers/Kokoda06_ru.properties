Description 21st Troop Carrier Squadron\n----------------------------------------\nMission #145  - Popondetta Parachute drop\n----------------------------------------\n1250 November 18th 1942\n----------------------------------------\nWeather - 7/10, Overcast\n----------------------------------------\n\nBriefing - OK, the Diggers and our own 32nd Division are closing in on the Gona-Buna delta, and MacArthur's getting itchy.  He and Kenney have identified a number of locations where we can establish landing grounds for forward supply, and he wants them secured ahead of the advance on the ground.  You'll be dropping a special force of airborne commandoes on the clearing at Popondetta.\n\nBe on the lookout for Jap AAA.  If it gets too fierce we'll abandon the drop.  Follow your assigned leader.\n
