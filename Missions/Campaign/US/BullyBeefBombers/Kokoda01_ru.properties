Description 21st Troop Carrier Squadron\n----------------------------------------\nMission #54  - Nauro Drop\n----------------------------------------\n0900 September 30th 1942\n----------------------------------------\nWeather - 7/10, Winds moderate to brisk\n----------------------------------------\n\nBriefing - Now that the Japs have been pushed back from Imita Ridge, the Diggers have inched forwards to Nauro with contacts relegated to small-party skirmishes.\n\nYou will drop requested supplies of food, medicine and rifle-caliber ammunition at Nauro.  The Diggers will mark the drop site.  They are reporting a large number of dysentry cases so this drop is considered urgent.\n\nProceed as per the allocated route.  If you see any bogeys head for cloud and call back to base immediately - we'll send fighters.  Do not try to play smart with them - it'll be the last time that you do.\n\nGod speed.\n
