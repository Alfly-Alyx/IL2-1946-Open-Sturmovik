Description 21st Troop Carrier Squadron\n----------------------------------------\nMission #71  - Myola Lake Drop\n----------------------------------------\n1505 October 11th 1942\n----------------------------------------\nWeather - 8/10, Winds moderate to strong\n----------------------------------------\n\nBriefing - Forward parties of Australian infantry have reached the Myola Lake area, where they are coming under sporadic harrassment fire.  They've requested new mortars and mortar ammunition, so we've pushed forward the schedule.\n\nYou will make the drop from 700 feet but no lower - the Diggers won't use the mortars if the parachute doesn't fully open.  If the base is damaged the mortar shells can explode in the barrel.  We've had Diggers have their legs sliced off when this occurs.\n\nWe have been given this request as the assholes in the 22nd keep missing.  Proceed as per the allocated route.\n
