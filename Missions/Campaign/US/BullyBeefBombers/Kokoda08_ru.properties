Head straight for Darwin, and don't spare the horses.  We'll need a nice, soft landing now, as that vaccine is in fragile vials, and it'll be going into you guys' backsides after we touch down.  That's if you don't want a dose of the shits when you eat the local tucker.\n\nStill, if you can get off duty you can join us for a cold beer in the town.  Dare say it'll go down a treat if you've just come back from Guinea....
