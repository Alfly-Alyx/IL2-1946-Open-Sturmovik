The invasion of Pantelleria would pave the way for an allied invasion of Sicily and then onto the italian mainland. It turned out to be far more than that and not that simple.\nBy the time Corkscrew was over, it had become a prime example of what devastating airpower could do.\nBetween May 8 and June 11 in 1943, Alied aircraft flew 5,285 bombing sorties against targets on Pantelleria and dropped 6,313 tons of bombs on italian and german forces stationed there.\nThe aerial offensive marked the first time in history that an enemy land force was compelled to surrender in the absance of an accompanying ground invasion.
