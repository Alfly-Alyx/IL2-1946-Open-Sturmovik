Our air and naval forces are bombing the coast prior to the final assault. Wave after wave of B-17s are approaching the target on the Pantelleria coast. British ground forces are in position in assault and landing craft, and are ready for disembarkation to Pantelleria.\nOur mission is to recon Pantellleria's beaches in front of the raiding force between grid sectors DH68 and DF67 and protect our navale forces from any enemy raid to counter act our force. In fact radar is reporting large formations of enemy planes approaching towards Pantelleria, so you should have company.\nReturn to base trough sector DH66.\n\nThis is it boys, we screw up now and it will take months before we can stike again.
