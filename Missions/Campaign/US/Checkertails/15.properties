Name mission 15
Short dive bomb\n
Description 29th May 1943\n\nThe daily missions to Pantelleria continue - bombing, escort, straffing, and not a sniff of any enemy fighters, only the occasional flying boat sneaking into the island gives us a chance for a kill.\n\nWe've now also got our very own Associated Press Officer in Hal Boyles, and it gives the guys a real boost to know that the folks back home can read about the 325th in the daily newspapers, Hal's latest story is about our captured 109-\n\nU.S. Army Me-109, the latest Nazi pursuit ship was sighted in a wheat field 20 miles north of Tunis last week by Major Robert Baseler of Philadelphia, the group operations officer, during a bombing mission-Baseler says\n\n" It appeared in good shape and we learned later that the German pilot had been wounded in combat and died after landing the ship in the field, we dropped down to look it over and a British commander gave us permission to take it"\n\nBaseler who himself has shot down one Me 109 and a Macchi 202 was first to test it and said it performed well but he preferred to fly the P-40-\n\n" I am six feet three inches and i have to fold up like a pretzel to get in the Messerschmitt, it has poor visability, i have lots more room in my P-40. But it is a very good plane, it handles fine, has a world of speed and pep, and climbs like a homesick angel. It's a really good ship to get out of a tight spot in a hurry, it's faster and climbs quicker than the P-40 but doesn't turn nearly as well, but it flies like a top."\n\nBaseler said the Me-109 had been put through tests and been used to simulate enemy attacks to give pilots an idea of what to expect on missions -\n\n" When this 109 bounces down at them, our boys learn more in two minutes than they would from a hundred lectures, and it gives us a chance to demonstrate the weeknesses of this type of enemy craft, and it does have weeknesses, it doesn't stack up with the new British Spitfires"\n\nYou hope to get a turn in the 109 yourself, Robert Myers took her up today, but had to belly land in with stuck wheels, luckily he made a perfect landing with just a bent prop, Bob says it will be ready to go up again tomorrow.\n\n\nOn yesterday's mission Baseler got Myers to carry a 1000 pound bomb, as far as we know this is the first time a P40 has carried such a heavy load, Myers had no problems so your flight will have a try out with them today, Bob thinks these big bombs will smash heavy concrete fortifications, and can't wait to try bombing a Tiger tank with one !\n\nThe Group target is again the harbor area, see if you can pick out any fortfications to bomb, we havn't got many of these 1000 pounders in our stores, so keep your bombs for the target and let the other flights deal with any enemy fighters.\n\n\nTake off 1600\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nReturn to base at sector AB10 within 40 mins.\n\nSkin - P-40_57thFG_2     Markings on\n
