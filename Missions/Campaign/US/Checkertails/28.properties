Name mission 28
Short Anti Shipping\n
Description 2nd August 1943\n\nThe war in Sicily looks to be coming to an end, with the remaining Axis forces bottled up in the Messina area, but they know everyday they hold out is another day Italy has before we invade.\n\nThings in Italy seem very confused, with their madman leader Benito Mussolini dismissed from office, and nobody knowing which side the new Italian Government will support, if they change over to the Allied side the war will be over by Christmas!\n\nAfter days of sweeps and escort missions over Sardinia, we go back to some anti-shipping work again to the North of Sicily, we have reports of a small convoy heading for Messina from a PBY.\n\nThe 319th FS will attack the convoy, with P38s as escort. Your crew chief has grounded your trusty old Warhawk for repairs and an overdue overhaul, so Bob Baseler lends you his own P40. Since taking over the Clan, Bob is too busy to fly many combat missions so has had his P40  'STUD' , and Hoimann the 109 painted all over black with red trim, and with the Checkertail on the P40 as well it looks amazing! And whenever Bob flies his P40 to visit another unit he gets a great reception.\n\nAs you wait to take off, you can see Bob's face as he sits in his jeep watching, his expression is - make sure you bring my ship back !\n\nFind and attack the Axis convoy, last known position was sector AK19.\n\n \nTakeoff 1700\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nReturn to base at sector AB14 within 1 hour\n\nSkin - P40F_325FG_Stud\n\nMarkings Off\n
