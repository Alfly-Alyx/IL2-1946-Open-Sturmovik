Name mission 19
Short Test fly 109\n
Description 20th June 1943\n\nPantelleria was finally invaded by British troops on the 10th (operation Corkscrew)  and promptly fell with little resistance the next day, the few Italian defenders being very happy to be captured by the friendly Allies!\n\nNow our eyes turn to Sardinia and Sicily, and with it a change of base for the 325th, with every Allied squadron being pushed towards the coast we are moving to the airfiled at Mateur to make room for new Groups - and we were just begining to feel at home!\n\nEverything that could be moved was thrown into trucks, jeeps, C47s, even our B25 ' Passion Flower the 2nd' is used, and Col Austin had patrols flying within hours of setting up his new plush HQ - that is to say he had a tent and a chair! The move caused big headaches for the Group's resident rebel Captain John Watkins, an engineering marvel he has not only helped build our shower with running hot water, but has also made a working still to produce his very own wine named ' Popskull de Tunisie' which has kept us going through the campaign! Watkins also experiments in the air, he's taken out the 2 outer guns in his P40 and reduced the amount of ammo to increase his speed and climb, he's already got a few kills under his belt using his 'special'  P40 ! Anyway all of John's contraptions have had to be carefully packed and moved, a lack of hot showers and wine could do more damage than the Krauts!\n\nWhile we settle in at our new home Bob at last lets you have your turn in ' Hoimann the German' as our Me-109 has been nicknamed. With lots of guys' families in our unit of German origin it was easy to get all the controls and dials translated into English, the 109 is a tricky ship to takeoff and land so you pay attention to the pilots that have already taken Hoimann up.\n\nBaseler tells you to fly to Pantelleria and back, but watch out for any P38 units, we've already been bounced by them by mistake, and P38s have failed to show up to escort us in previous missions  because they went chasing 109s, leaving us without cover...so make sure you bring back Bob's pride and joy in one piece !\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFly to Pantelleria and back.\n\nSkin - Bf-109G6_Yellow-16_JG27_Bl\n\nMarkings On\n\n\n\n
