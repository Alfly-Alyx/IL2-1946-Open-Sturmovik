Name mission 24
Short Operation Husky\n
Description 10th July 1943\n\nYes, Operation Husky - the invasion of Sicily is GO!\nLast night crack American and British paratroops where sent in to secure vital bridges and defence points and today a huge armada of ships has landed thousands of our boys on the Southern and Eastern beaches of Sicily, already the vital port of Syracuse is in British hands and it is expected that General Patton and the British General Montgomery will link up to form a proper front.\n\nVery strong winds meant that the operation was touch and go for a while and it's been tricky for us airmen providing cover for the invasion, but the weather conditions also fooled the enemy into not expecting us!\n\nWith all this excitment you forget that you won the bet on the invasion date - Wow 400 Bucks is now yours to spend ! Lets hope you can keep hold of it for when we get to Italy and some shops to spend it!\n\nOur first mission of today will be to escort B25s to Sciacca airfield, stay sharp, with so many allied aircraft flying about mistakes can happen, make sure of what you are shooting at, if you get hit make a forced landing near the invasion beaches, do not risk flying over the sea with a damaged plane - it's easier to replace a P40 than a pilot !\n\ntake off 0930, meet the B25s at sector AD16, once the bombers have completed the attack and are on their way home, look for targets of opportunity.\n\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEscort the Bombers to Sciacca Sicily.\n\nReturn to base at sector AB14 in 1 hour\n\nSkin -  P40F_325thFG_NoNumb02\n\nMarkings On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
