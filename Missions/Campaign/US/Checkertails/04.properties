Description 18th December 1942\n\n One week until Christmas, and the boys are already thinking about Turkey with all the trimmings! It's a pity the Germans are not in the festive spirit, they continue to annoy us here, but at least our infantry are making slow but sure progress fighting over very rough terrain.\n\nWe have had plenty of opportunity to study the new German fighter plane the Focke-Wulf 190, it seems to out perform our P40s in every area, and these Nazi pilots seem to prefer slashing attacks from up high and then zooming out of reach before we know what's hit us, the rumour is that for everyone 190 shot down we lose 3 P40s, i say it's a good job there is always a 4th P40 !\n\nToday Corkin' Cochran and his  'Joker squadron' as we in the 58th FS like to be  known, are playing nanny to  B17s attacking port facilities at sector G5, once the heavies have turned for home Corkin wants us to hit the deck and look for trouble - if it moves shoot it, if it doesn't move shoot it !\n\nTake off 0945, circle at sector E6 and wait for the bombers- and the boss reminds us to climb fast after take off - if we get caught low and slow the 190s will  think Christmas has come a week early!\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMeet the B17s at sector E6.\n Look for targets of opportunity on the way home.\nReturn to base at sector B5.\n\n\nSkin - P40F_65thFS_57thFG_USA\nMarkings on\n
