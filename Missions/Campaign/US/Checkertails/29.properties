Name mission 29
Short B25 test with bob hope and a Nurse!\n
Description 10th August 1943\n\nSicily has still not been taken yet, stubborn fighting by the Germans holding the small frontline before Messina has made things very hard going, but it is a day of rest for the 'Checkertail Clan' , the USO is in town !\n\nThe United Service Organisation provides a touch of home to all the guys fighting abroad, with shows and entertainment to help us forget the war for a few precious hours, and none other than Mr Bob Hope is visiting us today! We are all awaiting Baseler to fly back with Hope and his troupe, and soon he is touching down in our B25 with, Bob Hope, Jack Pepper, hildegard, Tony Romano and the beautiful Frances Langford.\n\nThe show is a huge hit, and Hope has everyone rolling in the aisles -\n\n"Well boys it sure is great to be here, the last show i did everyone was so polite - they covered their mouths when they yawned!"\n\n" I know how cold it was in Tunisia last winter - one G.I. fell out of bed and broke his pyjamas! "\n\n" It was darn cold in Washington as well - it was so cold the politicians hand their hands in their own pockets ! "\n\n" you fellas are so close to the sea, i heard one rookie on parade didin't hear the right turn command - now he's in the Navy ! "\n\n" I was at a party with my old pal Bing Crosby the other week - he sat down to tickle the ivories and Steinway came down personally and rubbed his name off the piano ! "\n\n" But Bing is a great guy, he doesn't pay income tax - he just phones up Washington and says How much do you fellas want this month? ! "\n\nand so it went on and on !   After the show, medals were given out, and when Frances Langford found out we had a heated shower she was not going to leave until she has enjoyed the comforts of home she had missed! Bob Hope asks what it is like to fly bombing missions and before you know it Baseler has you readying the B25 for some target practice, Hope makes his way into the glass nose and is already cracking jokes about how bad your aiming will be, and to make matters worse a very pretty Army Nurse sits beside you as co-pilot !\n\nThe honor of the Checkertail Clan is in your hands, hit all four targets that have been set up for you or the unit will be the butt of Bob Hope's Jokes, thats if you can tear your eyes off of the Nurses legs !\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDestroy the 4 targets located on the beach in front of our base. you only have 6 pairs of small bombs, so there's not much room for error, the USO troupe is late for it's next show, you've got to be back in 20 minutes.\n\nSkin - Desert-usaf-2tons\n
