Name mission 23
Short Dive Bomb\n
Description 5th July 1943\n\nA very sad day today, our fantastic leader Gordon Austin has been ordered to take over a bomber group, despite trying to pull every string to stay with his beloved Checkertails, he's been given a direct order to take over the helm of the 319th BG flying the new B26 Marauder, this hard luck unit has lost several leaders in combat, and morale is low, and a top leader is needed to knock the unit back into shape. Luckily for us Bob Baseler is taking over as our new Group C.O, with Capt Everett Howe becoming our boss in the 319th FS, Howe is another fine leader, with 4 kills under his belt.                       \n\nThis mornings strafing mission to Licata was a milk run so we are going to Marsala for some dive bombing this afternoon, we are looking for any German armored units that could pose a threat to the invasion.\n\nAs usual we've got P38s to provide our escort, they will meet us at sector AE17.\n\nTake off 1500, watch for the flak.\n\nWhen you return back from the mission get ready for Col Austin's farewell party tonight !\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAttack tanks and vehicles in Marsala at sector  AF16\n\nReturn to base at sector AB14 within 45 mins\n\nSkin - P40F_325FG_NoNumb02\n\nMarkings On\n
