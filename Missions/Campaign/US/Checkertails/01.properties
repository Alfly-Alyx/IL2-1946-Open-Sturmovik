Short Carrier take off in P40 !\n
Description 8th November 1942\n\nA massive armada of one thousand Allied ships and transports converge off the coast of North Africa-\n\nOPERATION TORCH IS GO !\n\n200,000 men and 20,000 vehicles land in Morocco and Algiers, America has now joined the war in Europe! The backdoor to Africa is now closed and the retreating Rommel and his elite Afika Korps are between a rock and a hard place.\n\n10th November 1942\n\nDespite these momentous events all you want to do is get off this darn aircraft carrier and stop feeling sea sick ! For weeks you and the rest of the 33rd Fighter Group have sailed direct from home to here onboard a converted oli tanker, now called the  USS Chenango, and now for 2 days we wait to fly off.\n\nOur C.O Col William Momyer has told us the airfield we're headed for at Port Lyautey Morocco is not yet safe from the French, lots of us scratch our heads, aren't the French on our side?! But today at last we are go for takeoff, our P40 Warhawks are ready on deck but nobody is confident we can takeoff from this small carrier despite all the practice State side, everyday at sea you have paced out the carrier's deck, and it seems smaller and smaller!\n\nAs you clamber into your trusty P40 you thank the U.S Army Airforce for painting your plane a nice shade of pink, and putting a huge American flag on the sides, if that doesn't help the Nazis spot you nothing will ! Throbbing engines and smoke fill the early morning air...you pat your new nose art for luck.."you're gonna need it buddy" you whisper to yourself.\n\nYou go through the drill yet again....cockpit locked open and chute unhooked in case you ditch, flaps full down, head pressed back on the headrest, signal to release chocks, gear up as soon as you've left the carrier deck...here we go !\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLand at your new airbase on the coast at sector B5\n\nChoose your P40's noseart to bring you luck.\n\nSkin - P40F_65thFS_57thFG_USA \n\nMarkings on\n
