Name mission 29
Short B25 test with bob hope and a Nurse!\n
Description 20th August 1943\n\nOperation HUSKY came to an end 3 days ago, and General Patton not only captured Palermo last week, but then raced ahead of Monty and was first into Messina as well!  " no guts no glory" as Patton says - or as our G.I.s say - " our guts, his glory! "\n Anyway another 200,000 Nazi troops are now guests of the USA until further notice.\n\nAnother first for us today, a fighter sweep by the 319th FS along the Italian coast, look for any targets of opportunity. Patrol from Salerno in sector AJ22 then down along  the coast. Land in Sicily if you have any problems.\n\nMore good news for us in the Checkertails, we are going to trade in our P40s for the newer Repulblic P47 Thunderbolt late in September. Although not as nimble as our trusty P40, it's much faster, can fly longer and higher, is stronger, and can out dive the devil !\n\nTake off 0900 for today's sweep.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*** AIRSTART ***\n\nSweep from sector AJ22 down to AM20\n\nReturn to base at sector AB14 in 1 hour\n\n\nSkin - P40F_325thFG-NoNumb01\n
