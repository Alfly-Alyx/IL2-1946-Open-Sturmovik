Name mission 17
Short Dive bombing\n
Description 6th June 1943\n\n The whole group is on a high after the seaplane mission on the 1st, Hal Boyles writes up his article -\n\n" In a fast moving hard hitting attack that left Stagnone seaplane anchorage in Sicily covered with burning sinking seaplanes, flight after flight of P-40 Warhawks went streaking today across the open sea and down to the 'deck' to spray lead at one flying boat after another. When the day's score was totalled 12 had been destroyed and 6 others left burning. Such craft have been used to haul supplies from the mainland to Sicily. One pilot said it was like running the low hurdles in a track meet, after passing over the base they took time out to strafe four boats in the harbor leaving them burning and sinking."\n\nAustin made us take it easy for a few days after, and we've only flown a couple of milk runs since, today it's back to Pantelleria for a dive bombing mission, from seeing our troop and ship movements it look like this tiny island will soon be marked 'property of US Government'\n\nyour flight will be loaded with 1000 pounders again so be careful on take off, and release the bomb no lower than 3000 ft.\n\nLook for any concrete bunkers near the harbor.\n\nTake off 1500\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nReturn to base at sector AB10 within 45 mins\n\nSkin - P-40_57thFG_2     Markings on\n
