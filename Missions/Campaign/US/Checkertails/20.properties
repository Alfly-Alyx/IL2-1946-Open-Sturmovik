Description 24th June 1943\n\nNice job bringing Hoimann back home, Baseler's crew chief thinks sand got into the fuel filter and cut the engine, and pulling off a deadstick landing in a Me-109 is something you never want to try again!\n\nToday Austin is sending the whole group to the airfields at Trapani as escorts to B25s, there has been plenty of enemy fighter activity of late so keep a good look out, once again the bets are on as to the date of the next  invasion, you lost 10 Bucks on the Pantelleria date, but that doesn't stop you putting another 10 down for Sicily, you pick the 10th July!\n\nAlso at last your ground crew have found time to paint your P40 with it's Checkertail, here's hoping it brings lots of luck!\n\nBaseler goes over the details yet again - The Group will start take off at 10:15 and meet the B25 bombers at sector AC17 at 10:35, 317th FS will do close escort, while the 318th and us in the 319th will be up higher, don't forget our job is to protect the bombers, not fly off glory hunting!\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEscort the Bombers to Trapani/Milo airfields.\n\nReturn to base at sector AB14 in 1 hour\n\nSkin -  P40F_325thFG_NoNumb02\n\nMarkings On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
