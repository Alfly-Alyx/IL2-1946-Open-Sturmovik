Name mission 1
Short Carrier take off in P40 !\n
Description 8th December 1942\n\nWell you made it to your new home, but the group lost 17 P40s in landing accidents on the pot holed damaged runway, although we repaired some of them. These African French soon gave up the fight, so there has been nothing to do over the last few weeks other than fly patrols and stand alert, as the C.O says we've gotta hurry up and wait!\n\nIt seems the Germans have been rushing over men and equipment from Italy to shore up Tunisia, and our G.I.s have been in a race to see who can grab the most land before the front lines get drawn. Some of our tough paratroopers captured the airfield at Thelepte and this is where you and the rest of the 58th Fighter Squadron have now flown into.\n\nWe are the first squadron to operate from Tunisia but it comes at a price, we've only been here a few days and the Luftwaffe have attacked us everyday forcing us to maintain constant air patrols over the base, and as we're so close to the front lines supplies are very slow coming up.\n\nAn early morning start today, takeoff 730 for the first patrol of the day, another flight will bomb shipping at a small harbor the Germans are using to slip in supplies. Remember after landing everyone has to take thier turn digging trenches and filling sandbags !\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPatrol your airfield at sector B5\n\n\n\nSkin - P40F_65thFS_57thFG_USA\nMarkings on\n
