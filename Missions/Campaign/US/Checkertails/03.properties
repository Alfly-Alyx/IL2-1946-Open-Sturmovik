Short ground attack\n
Description 12th December 1942\n\nThings are not getting any better, we seem to have been forgotten up here at the front, little supplies and spare parts are nowhere to be seen, holes and battle damage in our P40s are being patched up using old  tin cans!\n\nAnd another thing - nobody bothered to tell us how hellish cold it gets in Africa at night either! But despite going to bed wearing three layers and laying in a slit trench under our tents with rifles ready incase of a night attack morale is good, and the C.O. of our 58th Fighter Squadron- Major Phil Cochran  has us on the attack most days.\n\nToday we are going to see if we can find any enemy tanks to attack, being so close to the front line any reports of enemy armour moving our way are very worrying, if they break through they will be on us in no time, and the G.I.s tell us that if a Tiger tank attacks the only thing that can stop it is a direct hit from a bomb! \n\nwe are told P38s from another unit will provide top cover and the boss says look out for  RAF bombers operating near us.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLook for enemy tanks and convoys at grid ref F5, return to base at sector B5.\n\nSkin - P40F_65thFS_57thFG_USA\nMarkings on\n
