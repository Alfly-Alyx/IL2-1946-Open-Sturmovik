Description 5th January 1943\n\nWell the Christmas and New Year celebrations are over at last, i don't think my poor head could take anymore booze!\n\nThe war carries on as usual and everyone has become so used to it, it seems routine- until a pilot doesn't come back, lets hope the war is over by next Christmas!\n\nLevi Chase and Jimmy Gray have just landed from a recce, they shot up a few trucks and enemy positions and then noticed what they're sure was a B17 heavy bomber fully intact by the roadside, with German trucks getting ready to tow it ! As they were low on ammo and gas they came straight back to base to raise the alarm, Corky sends your pair up pronto-\n\n" ok boys see if you can identify the ship as a B17 and then blow it to hell, the last thing we need is the Nazis having a B17 to play with and test.."\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nThe B17 was spotted near the main highway to Tunis running through sectors H4 - H5\n\nSkin -P40F_65thFS_57thFG_USA\nMarkings on\n
