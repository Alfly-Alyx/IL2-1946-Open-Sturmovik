Name mission 27
Short Anti Shipping\n
Description 21st July 1943\n\nAs the Allied steamroller rolls across Sicily, huge aerial battles are a daily feature, we hate to say it but the Germans in their nimble 109s are taking a daily toll, and we are losing more planes  than them, but our big advantage in numbers is finally telling, and there is less and less enemy fighters coming up to meet us.\n\nWe guys at the 325th are building a great reputation for dogfighting, we've even got a mention on the  Nazi radio station from the female voice we call Axis Sally, this dame gives us great laughs at night listening to the her  'bedroom voice', she called us Checkertail Butchers as well as a few other less lady like names, and finished by saying - \n\n" watch out, we WILL remember you boys in the Checkertail Clan ! "\n\nThe name seems to have stuck, and now we guys \nin  'The Clan'  are walking taller than ever !\n\nIt's time for some bombing work again today, Axis shipping is bringing in men and supplies into Sicily whenever it can, every ship that makes it through delays the ground war, the far too cautious and old fashioned British General Monty is bogged down pushing towards Messina, while our fantastic General Patton has made huge gains and is at the gates of the capital Palermo, but a visiting English Pilot did point out that the enemy is retreating towards Italy not Palermo which is in the opposite direction, and of no strategic value !\n\nLook for Axis shipping between sectors AE19 and AE 21\n\nTakeoff 0700\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nReturn to base at sector AB14 within 1 hour\n\nSkin - P40F_325FG_NoNumb02\n\nMarkings On\n
