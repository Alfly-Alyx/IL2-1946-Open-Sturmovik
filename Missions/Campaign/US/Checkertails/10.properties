Name mission 10
Short fighter sweep\n
Description 18th April 1943\n\nCol Austin was pleased with yesterday's first mission, the B25s hit the target without loss, and our boys got their first taste of action.\n\nAustin has just put the phone down - Art Salisbury from the 57th FG has just called asking for help, he's had his squadrons flying sweeps all day looking for a group of enemy transports that the intelligence guys at HQ say will be flying into Tunis today to pick up and rescue key Nazi personnel, it could be a wild goose chase but Col Salisbury could do with another squadron to join in the last sweep of the day, there have been some big numbers of transports shot down by P38s and even B25s and he is keen to get in on the act! Nobody knows where or how this intelligence gets to us, but it's normally spot on, the pilots assume it's from Italian prostitutes working for the Allies!\n\nCol Austin tells Baseler to send your flight down to the 57th FG base at sector AQ13, you'll then take off with them, Salisbury has even talked the RAF into providing top cover - if the Germans are coming over they've got to get in before dark, we've just got to find them...\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPatrol sectors AZ14 - BC14\n\nReturn to base at sector AQ13 with 1 hour\n\n\nSkin- P40_57thFG_2\nMarkings on\n
