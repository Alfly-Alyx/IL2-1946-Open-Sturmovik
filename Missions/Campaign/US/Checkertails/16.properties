Name mission 16
Short attack seaplane base\n
Description 1st June 1943\n\nYesterday's mission went without a hitch, although a couple of P40s released their bombs too low and got caught in the blasts - more holes for the ground crew to patch up. The sorties to Pantelleria are becoming a milk run, the flak has been destroyed and there is no sign of the Luftwaffe.\n\nWe are all awake at 4am today, the boss has been told that  the seaplanes we keep meeting are coming from Stangone in Sicily, they are flying in supplies and ammo to the island and must be stopped.The Group has been told to strafe the base and destroy as many aircraft as possible and Col Austin is going for a surprise dawn attack and sending the whole Group up at first light, hitting the base hard, low and fast.\n\nAlso last month, Head Quarters asked all fighter and bomber groups to come up with distintive identification markings to paint on their aircraft so we can tell easily which group a plane came from, Bob is a fan of Werner Voss a German WW1 flyer - known as the Checkerboard Ace because of the paint job on his Triplane, and wanted to put something similar on our P40s, with the help of John Watkins - who has already built our heated shower and homebrew wine still, they came up with a few ideas and settled on a black and yellow checkerboard design to go on the tail of the P40, Col Austin loved it, and as luck would have it Watkins knows General Carl Spaatz the commander of the Northwest African Airforce as we are now known. John flew a P40 with it's fancy tail to Algeria, and was soon back with written permission to use the design from the General !\n\nA couple of P40s have been painted already, but with paint as hard to come by in Africa as good looking women  or enemy fighters it's going to take a while before all our P40s have their 'Checkertails' on.\n\nBob Baseler goes over today's mission yet again - keep low and in formation, and when we start our  straffing attacks keep one eye on the other P40s to avoid collisions, and one eye on the mirror incase we're bounced..i think i need a 3rd eye !\n\n\nTake off 0600\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nReturn to base at sector AB10 within 1 hour.\n\nSkin - P-40_57thFG_2    Markings on\n
