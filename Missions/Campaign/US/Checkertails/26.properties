Short Dive Bomb tiger tanks\n
Description 12th July 1943\n\nThe fight in Sicily is going well, we have a well established front line and are pushing forward everywhere, but resistance is stiffining the more we push inland, and the Army Airforce is flying every available hour to help our boys on the ground.\n\nIntelligence has warned that the elite Hermann Goering Panzer Division is concentrating NE of Gela making ready for a counter-attack with it's Tiger Tanks, these tanks might cut through our lines like a hot knife through butter and must be stopped.\n\nA20 Havocs will bomb the area from medium alttitude, then we will attack at low level after with 1000 lb pounds, strafe the area after, if you get hit try and make it to Pachino airfield on the SE tip which is now has a clear runway for emergency use. P38s will as usual provide the escort, British fighters will also be sweeping the area.\n\nTry and keep away from the landing areas - yesterday Patton ordered a paratroop drop to reinforce the center where we are attacking today, the Allied landing fleet claim they were not informed of the operation, and opened fire on seeing our transport planes just after the enemy had attacked, it's rumoured that lots of our C47s were hit and many men killed, it's SNAFU  for those poor bastards.\n\nTake off 0900\n\nAttack enemy armor and vehicles in the NW of  sector AJ15.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nReturn to base at sector AB14 within 45 mins\n\nSkin - P40F_325FG_NoNumb02\n\nMarkings On\n
