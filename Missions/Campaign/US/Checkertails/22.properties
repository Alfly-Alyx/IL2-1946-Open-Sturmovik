Name mission 22
Short Escort B25s\n
Description 30th June 1943\n\nThe powers that be still feel that the Trapani/Milo airfields pose a threat, so after our morning patrol, we escort bombers there again later today. The Nazis know that Sicily will be our next invasion target, and HQ is sure there will be a big enemy air reaction. We are getting to know this island now with the famous town of Palermo in the NW and Messina and Mount Etna in the East, when we take Sicily we can almost walk into the boot of Italy and mainland Europe.\n\nAt last just about every P40 in the unit has got it's Checkertail, and now that we are flying over Sicily and soon Itlay Col Austin has told the ground crews to not bother wasting time with desert camoflage and to leave any new P40s in their original olive drab and put the checkertails over that.\n\nToday it's the A20 Havoc bombers turn to attack, take off is 1415, make sure the bombers get a clear run.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEscort the Bombers to Trapani/Milo airfields.\n\nReturn to base at sector AB14 in 1 hour\n\nSkin -  P40F_325thFG_NoNumb02\n\nMarkings On\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
