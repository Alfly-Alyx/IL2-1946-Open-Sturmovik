Short intercept\n
Description 1st Feb 1943\n\nJust when we thought we were on top of things the Luftwaffe is stepping up the pressure on us again, a couple of weeks ago our base was raided 3 times in a day, and although we gave them a bloody nose each time the whole group is down to 28 flyable P40s, with our squadron lucky if we can put 10 fighters into the air, so the news is that our group will pull out of the frontline in a week or 2 for a rest and get the squadrons back to full strength.\n\nBut there is good news, the British 'Desert Rats'  finally captured Tripoli a few days ago, well it only took them 2 years, prehaps they should have a few less tea breaks! So the generals are now saying that it's only a matter of time before the Nazis are squeezed into the top corner of Tunisia - then into the sea. Also our Rusky allies say they have defeated the Germans at Stalingrad and captured a whole army!\n\nToday we are flying a fighter sweep near Maknassy, a tank battle is under way, and we are to maintain air superiority over the area to support our troops, Corky is sending the whole squadron up - thats 7 airworthy P40s today!\n\n \n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n Patrol sector E1, to protect ground forces from air attack, return to base in 1 hour.\n\n\nSkin - P40F_65thFS_57thFG_USA\nMarkings on\n
