Name mission 31
Short Hoimann strikes again !\n
Description 1st September 1943\n\nAs all we P40 pilots know, our so called fellow US Army P38 pilots see anything with a single engine as probably an enemy aircraft, and we in the checkertails have been bounced a number of times, especially by the 14th FG. This morning some of our P40s had more than the normal amount of holes in them after the 14th had not shown up to provide our escort for a bombing mission to Sardinia, they must have sighted a German plane and gone after it, ignoring the fact they were supposed to be looking after us!\n\nBob Baseler has decided it's time for the Clan to get some revenge on the 14th FG, and tells you to roll out  ' Hoimann ' and go and 'beat up' their base at zero altitude! Pull up after so When they see the 109's outline they'll be like a bunch of chickens that have spotted a chicken hawk, and running for cover everywhere, they should just be sitting down for lunch as well ! Go scare the s**t out of'em..\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMake two passes at zero feet at the 14th FG's base near the town of Sfax in sector AB10\n\nSkin - Bf-109G-6_Hoimann\n\nMarkings Off\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is the last mission of-\n\n                'Checkertails Across The Med'\n\nThe 325th FG fly a few more missions in Sept before leaving the front line for training on the P47 Thunderbolt, they return to action in Italy in January 1944, for even more glory and honor...but that's another story !\n\nCampaign by Stiboo        www.bigwing.net\n\n 12th December 2008\n\n
