Name mission 9
Short Bomber escort\n
Description \u0020\n 6th May 1943\n\nThe 'Gooseshoot' as the mission of 18th April is called by the press was celebrated long and hard by all involved - 74 German transports were claimed as shot down for the loss of only 6 P40s, and it's gone down as one of the greatest fights of all time, three of our pilots made ACE in a day !\n\nWe've had a few dive-bombing missions since then, and today we are going to attack shipping for the first time. The Germans are desperate to evacuate as many men as they can from Tunisia before they finally surrender, and the rumour is that Tunis could fall to us anytime now, and there's been a constant stream of boats coming from the small island of Pantelleria off the coast of Cape Bon and the coast of Sicily.\n\nSo it's a sea sweep today - attack any shipping you see in sectors AD15-AD16\n \n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***AIRSTART****\n\n\n\n\nSkin - P40_57thFG_2      Markings on\n
