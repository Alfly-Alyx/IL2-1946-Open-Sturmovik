Name mission 12
Short Attack Harbour\n
Description 11th May 1943\n\nParts of Tunis still hold out, but already the powers that be are looking across the Mediterranean at Italy, but before we can invade Italy there is Sicily, and before Sciliy there is the small island of Pantelleria - which must be taken before any invasion can take place. We're told this small bit of rock is bristling with radar, observation posts, aerials, and big fortifications.\n\nThe Generals expect a very heavy fight to capture this island and want a big aerial offensive before they land any troops. We are going after more shipping today in the Harbor of Pantelleria while B25s will be attacking suspected ammo dumps inland.\n\nTake off is at 1000 with 500lb bombs, watch for the flak it could be nasty.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReturn to base at sector AB10 within 40 mins.\n\nSkin - P40_57thFG_2     Markings on\n
