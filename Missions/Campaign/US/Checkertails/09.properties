Short Bomber escort\n
Description Well we finally pulled out of Thelepte on 8th Feb, and made our way back to Agadir in Morocco for a well earned rest, we boys of the 33rd FG are now the most experienced outfit in the 12th Airforce.\n\nSeems the battle here in Tunisia is far from over - in a shock strike, Rommel the hit us hard at a  place called Kasserine Pass with his Afrika Korps veterens, and the rumour is that for the first time ever American troops were in a full uncontrollable retreat running away from the huge indestuctable Tiger tanks, and for a time Rommel looked like he would cut the Allied forces in Tunisia in half, but thanks to us Army Airforce guys attcking the Germans non-stop, the situation has been saved and Rommel has withdrawn to lick his wounds. It's made us Yanks a bit less cocky and we now look at the British 8th Army that defeated Rommel last October with much more admiration.\n\nWhile the group rests Maj Cochran has been asked to help the new 325th FG get up to speed, and takes me along to Tafaroui in Algeria to help instruct the new pilots, the 325th have had to give up half of it's P40s to our 33rd, so there's plenty of time to train before they group is back up to strength again. So flying training, convoy patrols and endless lectures about  aerial combat are the order of the day. Col Austin the C.O of the 325th is already a legend, in charge of a fighter squadron at Wheeler field Hawaii, he was flying in a small liason plane when the Japs struck Pearl Harbor, he managed to fly back to Wheeler and get some of his P40s airborne to claim 8 Jap aircraft destroyed.\n\n1st April 1943\n\nMaj Cochran droops the bombshell that you are ordered to transfer to the 325th FG, an April Fools joke? No - Col Austin wants at least one veteran in each of his squadrons to help and advise his leaders, you are to join Maj Robert Baseler's 319th FS. \n\nBaseler is tall, soft spoken, easy going, and enjoys a joke, and welcomes you as his top pilot !\n\n" Well son better get yourself in order - we fly to Montesquieu which is about 100 miles East of Tunis in 4 days time, lets hope we get some action before the war in North Africa is over! "\n\n17th April 1943\n\nWow the days are flying by, and although the 325th was only formed a few months ago, with it's popular good leaders it feels like a top outfit already. The war is going great as well - our troops are now out of the hilly rugged middle of Tunisia and are advancing fast, the Germans are now trapped like fish in a net around Tunis and resistance is crumbling.\n\n Today at last the 325th FG flies it's first official mission of the war, the 318th and 319th Fighter Squadrons will escort B25s attacking Mateur, should be a milk run.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***AIRSTART****\n\nMeet the B25s at sector AB14, return to exit point at AA15 within 45 mins.\n\n\n\nSkin - P-40_57thFG_2\n
