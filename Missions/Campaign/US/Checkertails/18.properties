Name mission 18
Short Dive bombing\n
Description 10th June 1943\n\nThe Krauts are putting up a fight at last, and after our big shindig on the 6th June when we shot down 6 109s for no loss, enemy fighters are being seen almost everyday. We are still waiting for this dam island to be taken, and we've flown missions there every single day this month.\n\nToday is no different, you've already flown an escort mission this morning, and now you are getting ready to take off on the Group's 6th mission of today for some dive bombing. The 79th FG have already had some dogfighting today, so keep alert.\n\nLook for targets of opportunity in the harbor area.\n\n\nTake off 1600\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nReturn to base at sector AB10 within 45 mins\n\nSkin - P-40_57thFG_2    Markings on\n
