Name        La-5F N1
Short       HUNTER AND HUNTED\n
Description \nDate: 11th July 1943\nTime: 07.00\nWeather: Clouds at 1300m\nVisibility: Poor up to 1000m, Good after 1700m, excellent after 2200m\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nAs our 69th Army defends valiantly against the might of the 3rd SS Panzergrenadier Division Totenkopf it is coming under increasing air attack from the Schlachtflieger of the Luftwaffe. Specialised Stuka, Fw-190 and Henschel-129 variants are wreaking havoc on our armour, even as our Sturmoviks pound the advancing panzers. The Germans are building up he pressure for a big attack - its up to the Red Airforce to see that we still have units on the ground to defend against it.\n\nMISSION:\n\nYou will fly 4 La-5F fighters of the 8th Guards Fighter Division - protecting our troops as they defend against the German armoured thrust. Other aircraft are scouring the skies for German fighters - your job is to protect our ground forces by preventing German attack aircraft from prowling over our lines. A little altitude should let you pick out targets moving below you but once you are above the clouds they will be hard to spot in the fog. \n\n
