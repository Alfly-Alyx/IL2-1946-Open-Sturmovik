This area is becomming increasingly more important to us and they are aware of that.\n\nThus it is only logical that their activity in this region has also increased.\n\nToday we have to protect that area from German attacks. \n\nBut beware, eventhough we are in an numerical advantage they do know how to get a hit.\n\nGood luck\n\n
