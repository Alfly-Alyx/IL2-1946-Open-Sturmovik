Short Hard prey *1945\n
Description Date: March 14,1945\nTime: 7:45\nWeather: Good\nClouds at 1100 m\n\nComrades, \n\nwe received an order from high command  to patrol airspace over Gorzow Wielkopolski (Landsherg). \n\nBecause eventhough the Germans are running out of supplies they don't seem to give up.\n\nYesterday we had some serious losses due air raids near Sulecin and we don't want that to happen again.\n\nThe most frequent targets of German attacks there are cars. We must ensure the safety of our transports and communications.\n\nGood luck\n
