Description January 1,1945 0800 hours\nWeather: 3/10 clouds at 1200 m\n\nGentlemen!\n\nFor today you will hunt the Tamasi area again. This area has been visited quite often by the Axis forces the last couple of days so it pretty logical that we will meet some enemy kites today. However their exact number is unknown. \n\nDespite our best efforts the Germans occasionally mount a successful sortie that scores some hits on our supply trains. These raids become increasingly more organized, as the Germans are encouraged by our inability to stop them. Today we're going to specifically focus our efforts on protecting the rail lines.\n\nWell boys lets give them a nice surprise and hope it will work out fine.\n
