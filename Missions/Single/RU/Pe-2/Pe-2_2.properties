Description \nRoad to Szekesfehervar\n\nDate: 16th of December, 1944 \nTime: 09:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kazsok\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nBy mid-January of 1944, units of the 3rd Ukrainian front took positions near Lake Balaton in Hungary, cutting off enemy units West of Budapest. At the same time, the 2nd Ukrainian Front's advance to the North took position North of the Hungarian capital. The success of both fronts opened the opportunity to surround and annihilate German units at Budapest.\n\nA recent Stavka Directive ordered the 3rd Ukrainian to strike from Velence lake towards Biczke, to take the Southern bank of the Danube, and cut off the routes to the West for the Budapest defenders.\n\nThe offensive was prepared in a hurry, as usual. Aerial reconnaissance was of crucial importance. Today the planners request information on enemy roadways leading to Szekesfehervar. \n\nYour Objective: reconnoiter the roadways between Mor and Szekesfehervar.\n\nYour Flight: Pe-2 / 359.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 09:00, heading north-nest. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3,000 m. A flight of Yak-9Us will fly ahead of you, clearing the airspace. After crossing the front line, head for Mor, then turn South-East and proceed towards Szekesfehervar over the railway. After conducting your mission, report home. \n\n
