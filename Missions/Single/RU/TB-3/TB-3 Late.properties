Short DAWN BOMBER\n
Description DAWN BOMBER\n\n10th January 1942\n\nWith the retreat of German forces before the onslaught of the Red Army in full swing the Red Air Force is being called on to play its part. With our older aircraft being no match for the Germans in daylight we are switching a major part of our effort to the hours of darkness and twilight.\n\nThis morning we are mounting a raid on the headquarters and reserve elements of the German 68th Infantry Division. Our reconnaissance shows a number of parked tanks and trucks in a barracks at Klementievo.\nHeavy bombers of the 34 BAP and U-2 light bombers of the 623 NLBAP will strike targets at the barracks. Be careful - German flak can be heavy.\n
