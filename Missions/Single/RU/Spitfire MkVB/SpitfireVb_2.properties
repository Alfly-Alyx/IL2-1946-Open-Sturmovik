Name Spitfire Mk.Vb N1
Short PVO MOSCOW\n
Description PVO MOSCOW\n\n20th August 1943\n\nThe Spitfire V has been accepted into the air defence regiments of PVO Moscow because of its good high altitude ability. As the Germans seem to have decided that heavy bombing of the capital is unproductive, regiments of the PVO have been sent nearer the front line to provide defence against fast reconnaissance aircraft.\n\nOur RUS-2 radar has detected a single high intruder heading for Vyazma. Get high over the town and shoot him down.\n
