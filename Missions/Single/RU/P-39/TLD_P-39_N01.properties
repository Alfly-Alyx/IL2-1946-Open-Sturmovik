Short Bomber intercept \n
Description Date: July 27,1944\nTime: 15:00\nWeather: Good\nClouds at 1400 m\n\nGentlemen, some interception duty today. Intel has suggested us to patroll the Krosno area. Because it is most likely the enemy will perform an air raid on it today.\n\nHowever we do have a nice surprise for them in town.  A large group  of IL2 Sturmovik ground attack aircrafts will take off as soon as the enemy bombers are on their way.  Due the lack of attention at their own bases we might have a nice and juicy target.\n\nBut for now all I can say is good luck.\n
