Short *Luft 46* Forcing breakthrough\n
Description Date : July 20th 1945\nTime : 14:20\nWeather : Good\nClouds : 1100M\n\nGentlemen,\n\nFor today our targets will be German artillery near Barszentmihalyfa.\nThe Bridges are main priority for our ground forces. They have to capture them in tact however heave fighting is going on on both sides.\n\nThe Germans and Hungarians are not about to give up.\n\nIt is up to you to breach their front.\n\nNote that a group of new US jet fighters similair to the German jet fighters is heading our way to offer us a helping hand.\n\nStalin has agreed to offer them a stay at our airbases.\n\nAnd maybe we will be able to inspect them for our own jet research project.\n\nGood luck\n
