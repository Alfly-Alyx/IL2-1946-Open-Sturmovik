Name TB-3 4M-34R (Zveno-SPB) N1
Short ZVENO\n
Description ZVENO\n\n30th October 1941\n\nThe Zveno SPB base and assembly point at Yevpatoriya has been invaluable for attacks on the Rumanian ports and oil facilities to the west. Now however the German and Rumanian breakthrough in the Perekop Isthmus has put our base under risk of direct ground attack. To prevent this the Zveno units have been ordered to strike at bridges in the Isthmus to hinder enemy re-supply.\n\nYour target today is a rail bridge that carries all the rail traffic between the Crimea and the mainland. The heavy AA defences mean that normal bombers stand no chance of making it, but the tiny I-16s should get through. Just don't drop them too late: the AA gunners will find your large, slow aircraft an easy target. In addition to the anti-aircraft fire you can expect fighter defences, so we are sending an escort from the Black Sea Fleet Airforce.\n
