Name I-16 (Zveno-SPB) N1
Short SUDDEN STRIKE\n
Description SUDDEN STRIKE\n\n16th July 1942\n\n===Warning: Air Start===\n\nThe Germans have retaken the Kerch-Feodosiya area that we held for six months and now threaten the Kuban and Caucasus regions from the north. We desperately need to slow down their drive for the Caspian oilfields and our Persian lend-lease route.\n\nOur aircraft have spotted German freighters in the Kerch Straits but were driven away by the enemy fighters. Our conventional bombers have little chance of getting close, so its up to the Zveno to attack. Your priority is the petrol tanker and you are armed with two heavy bombs. Don't miss!\n\n\n
