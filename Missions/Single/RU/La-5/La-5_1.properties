Name La-5 N1
Short THE KOTKA RAID\n
Description \n23rd September 1943\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nOur strategic goal for 1943 is to take naval and air control of the Gulf of Finland away from the Finns to allow us freedom of operations. Our major target in pursuit of this goal is the port of Kotka, the base of several Germans and Finnish ships.\n\nThe recent introduction of modern fighters into the ranks of the Red Banner Baltic Sea Airforce has allowed us to engage the Finnish fighters with more confidence. We can now fly faster than the Finnish Brewster and although the Germans have now given Messerschmidts to Finland, they are believed to number less than 50.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTime: 13.00\nWeather: Good, clouds at 1000m\n\nYou will lead a flight of La-5 aircraft of 4. GIAP KBF escorting Pe-2s in an attack on shipping in Kotka harbour in the south of Finland. This is a big mission, involving 8 Pe-2 dive-bombers from Oranienbaum. Yak-1s will fly close escort - your role will be to fly above the bombers and intercept any fighters attacking them. \n\nYou will lead the second flight of La-5s - follow Capt. Starchenko who will lead our squadron. You should take up position some 400 metres behind his flight and look out for enemy fighters.\n\nFly west from Kotlin Island and rendezvous with the bombers and Yaks from Oranienbaum before heading north to Kotka. \n\n
