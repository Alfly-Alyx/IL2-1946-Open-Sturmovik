Name BI-6 Hybrid Power Fighter
Short Intercept me-323's flying the Soviet BI-6 hybrid power fighter\n
Description This is a very simple mission built for the sole purpose of testing the BI-6 hybrid power fighter.\n\nClimb as fast as you can to 6000mt flying to the north-west. The enemy flies south-east in a bunch of me-323 (very though to shut down).\nYou have only 45 shells in each of your cannons and a very limited flight autonomy.\n\nThe BI-6 doesn't like to turn and it has a tendecy to enter uncontrollable and unrecoverable dives. \nIt is without doubt the most difficult plane to fly in il2, among those I've tried so far.\n\nThe BI-6 uses a rocket engine for take-off and for quick accelerations, hard climbs etc., and two ramjet engines for normal operation.\nThe ramjet is essentially a jet engine without turbine, the air flow through the engine is caused by the spped of the aircraft itself, which of course means that it can only be started in-flight at high speed.\nIt becomes effective over 320kph.\n\nYou need to control the three engines separately: bind keys for select/unselect engine #1, #2 and #3- I use the numbers 1,2,3 on the top row (not the keypad) bound to the 'toggle engine #...' function.\n\nEngine #1 is the rocket, while engines #2 and #3 are the left and right ramjets, respectively.\n\nCheck out the BI-1 and BI-6 sections in the Aircraft Guide.pdf, it's in the main game folder.\n
