Description \nHigh Profile\n\nDate: 21st of January, 1942 \nTime: 08:30 \nWeather: Hazy\nLocation: Ostashevo\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nOn the 15th of January, 1942, Soviet units under General Maslennikov approached Sychevka on the Kalinin Front. Heavy fighting followed, and the Red Army was unable to take the city. An important line of communications, the Vyazma - Sychevka - Rzhev railway, still remained in German hands, allowing them to rapidly re-deploy their units from one hotspot to another. Sychevka received considerable reinforcements to the SS Division Das Reich, two Panzer divisions, and a few other units. Our 39th Army could advance no longer.\n\nOn the Western Front, Germans began a gradual retreat on the 16th of January, and fell back to the defensive line along the Yuknov - Rzhev highway. The highway was also of extreme strategic importance, and the German High Command would not give it up easily.\n\nThe 20th Army liberated Lotoshino on the 16th, and Shakhovskaya the next day. These battles cost the Red Army many casualties, and after the liberation of Mozhaisk three days later, the 20th was barely capable of battle. On the same day Stalin issued an order committing the 1st Shock Army from the reserves and sending it against the Germans alongside the 20th. The 1st was making good progress bringing up the flank, but the 20th was barely able to hold its current position.\n\nDue to the increasingly complex situation, representatives of the Soviet High Command often visited front-line regiments. Fighter aviation, already spread too thin, had to provide ample escorts to VIP transport flights.\n\nToday, the 9th BBAP equipped with Pe-3 heavy fighters, is ordered to escort the Li-2 transport plane from Ostashevo to Balabonov. The Li-2 is carrying high-ranking VIPs close to Stalin. They must be protected at all costs.\n\nYour Objective: defend the VIPs.\n\nYour Flight: 6 Pe-3.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 08:30, heading West. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 2,000 m, stay above and behind the transport. In case of an enemy attack, do not get engaged in dogfights; merely chase them off, and rejoin the Li-2.\n\n
