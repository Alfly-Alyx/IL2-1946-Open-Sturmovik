Description \nDefending a Convoy\n\nDate: 30th of May, 1942 \nTime: 07:00 \nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ura-Guba\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nThe latest lend-lease convoy, designated PQ-16, left Reykjavik on May 21st. The convoy consists of 34 transports and 14 escorts. For some time, the convoy managed to avoid detection by the enemy. However by the 24th of May, the Germans found the ships and began a series of attacks that is still ongoing. German bombers alone sank six of the transports. \n\nOn the 30th, the convoy split up into two parts. The larger group headed for Archangel, and the smaller one to Kola bay.\n\nThe airspace over the smaller convoy is patrolled by Pe-3 heavy fighters of the 95th Northern Fleet IAP, and Hurricanes and P-40s of the 70th VVS IAP. A flight of P-40s discovered a formation of Ju-88 bombers at 06:50, ten minutes ago. A subsequent battle with the German escorts led to the downing of two planes on each side, but no losses to the bombers. \n\nThe 95th and 78th IAPs are scrambled to intercept the bombers.\n\nYour Objective: disrupt the German attack on PQ-16.\n\nYour Flight: 3 Pe-3.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 07:00, heading North. Flight route is marked on your maps. Climb to 3,000 m. Your flights target is enemy bombers. Fighters of the 78th IAP will deal with the escort.\n\n
