Short Patrol over Kanev\n
Description Patrol over Kanev\n\nDate: 22nd of June, 1946\n          0930\nWeather: Haze\nLocation: Peschanov\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nEarly this morning our paratroopers landed in the vicinity of Kanev and Pereyaslav, and were able to take control of two bridges over the river Dnepr. Our paratroopers are currently under heavy fire from German defenders. Reinforcements are already using the bridges to move towards the established bridgeheads.\n\nThese bridges are currently vulnerable, as virtually no flak coverage exists in the area at the time. We are expecting repeated bombing strikes on the bridge. The airspace is currently patrolled by Yak-15s of the 261st IAP. You are ordered to take off and relieve them at their station.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nTake two zvenos of LaGG-3RDs to the Kanev bridge, and disrupt any German bombing attack. The bridge must remain intact.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x LaGG-3RD\n\nLoadout: standard.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake off at 0930 heading west. Flight route is marked on your maps. \n\n
