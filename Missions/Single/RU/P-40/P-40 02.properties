Name P-40 N2
Short P-40s OVER THE ICE ROAD\n
Description \n1st January 1942\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nAs the Germans cut off Leningrad to the south and the Finns seal it off to the north, the ice road over Lake Ladoga becomes Leningrads lifeline. The Germans attack the route constantly, bombing trains and stations at either end, strafing trucks and other vehicles and restricting the movement of food, petrol, ammunition and the other vital supplies to nights and bad weather.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTime: 0700\nWeather: Good, Cumulus Clouds at 1500\n\nYou will fly in a Zveno of 4 P-40 aircraft from 158. IAP based in Leningrad to cover the ice road from German attacks. The Messerschmitts of III./JG54 Grunherz have already carried out one attack today and more can be expected. Keep your eyes open, especially crossing the shores of the lake, as that is where the enemy likes to attack.\n\nIf you run into difficulty, head for our flak positions in Leningrad or Tikhvin.\n\n
