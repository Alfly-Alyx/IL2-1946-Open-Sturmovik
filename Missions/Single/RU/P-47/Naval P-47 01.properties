Name P-47 N1
Short P-47 in Soviet Naval aviation\n\nMarch 17th, 1944\n\nAttacking a German naval convoy\n
Description \nMarch 17th, 1944\n10:20 AM\n\nComrades,\n\nOur aerial reconnaissance has located the German convoy N110 moving towards mainland Germany. Four torpedo bombers from 9th GMTAP led by Kapitan L.I. Markov protected by our IAP's P-40s attacked the convoy earlier this morning. The number of the enemy ships turned out to be much greater than anticipated. They also had a large fighter cover. Our first strike group reported four transports escorted by at least 20 German warships with 30+ enemy fighters loitering above. We sunk one enemy transport, however all of our torpedo bombers were shot down: two by enemy fighters and the remaining two by German flak. Our fighters claimed several victories.\n\nYour mission will progress as follows. Six P-47's in flights of four and two will take off at 11:40. They will be escorted by 8 of our P-40s. Based on the enemy convoy's last reported position and heading we expect it to be somewhere in sector O-27. We anticipate your time on target to be 11:50. The convoy is large so you should have no problems finding it. Scattered clouds are reported over the whole Finnish gulf at 1,500 meters so P-47s will fly all the way to target at that altitude to maximize the element of surprise. P-40s will fly in two groups, one at 2,000 and the other at 3,000 meters. They are to protect the strike package at all costs.\n\nThe main target for the P-47s is the enemy escort ships. You must tear a hole through their defences through which our torpedo bombers will follow. All men pick their target and attack in pairs in standard 45-degree dives. Once P-47s begin their attack the lower group of P-40s will drop with them under the cloud cover. After dropping their bombs, P-47s can attack enemy fighters if the opportunity arises. \n\nTorpedo Il-4s protected by more fighters should be attacking the convoy a few minutes after you arrive. They will be coming in at sea level so make sure not to attack them. If there is significant fighter opposition in the air, all planes must stay in the air and protect the IL-4s.\n\nThis is one of the hardest missions we've faced this year, and also one of the most important. German convoys of this size are becoming very rare, and the number of naval and airborne escorts leads us to believe that the Germans are carrying very important cargo. We have overwhelming numerical superiority in the area, and the Germans were only able to establish temporary local control. You must retake control of the air over the convoy and make it easy for our bombers to attack the transports.\n\n
