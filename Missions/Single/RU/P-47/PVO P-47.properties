Description \nP-47D in Soviet PVO (Anti-Aircraft defence)\n\nMarch 22, 1944\n22:00\n\nComrades,\n\nLeningrad was liberated two months ago, but Germans stubbornly continue to send their bombers to terrorize the citizens of the city who have suffered so much. Your mission is simple. Four of the new P-47s and four La-5's will take-off at 22:45. P-47s will climb to 4,000 meters and La-5's to 6,000 where you will patrol a 30-km area Soutn-West of Leningrad. The chances of Germans coming are not very high, but reinforcements will be available on a two-minute alert should you need them.\n\nIn the event of enemy bombers slipping in unnoticed, you will be directed from the ground after they are seen or heard over the city. If you see any enemy fighters report them immediately, as our anti-aircraft gunners will not be able to tell enemy from friendly at such an altitude. At this time they are instructed not to fire at any fighter-sized planes. \n\nGood luck.\n\n
