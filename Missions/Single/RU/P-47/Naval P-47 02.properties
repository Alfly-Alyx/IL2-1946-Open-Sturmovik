Name P-47 N2
Short P-47 in Soviet Naval aviation\n\nJune 17th, 1944\n\nAnother attack on a German naval convoy\n
Description \nJune 17th, 1944\n09:55 AM\n\nComrades,\n\nOur aerial reconnaissance has located another German convoy. At this time the exact number of enemy ships is not known, but it should be anywhere between 10 and 25. They were already struck earlier today by 18 P-40 fighter-bombers. They reported 14 enemy fighters protecting the convoy, and have claimed 8 of them. However, no enemy ships were sunk. IL-2s followed in the second wave at 09:04 but were also not able to sink any transports. We are now sending the main wave, in which there will be 12 IL-2s of 9th GMTAP led by Maior Voloshin, 6 A-20Gs, and 10 more torpedo bombers. The bomber groups will be protected by 46 fighters.\n\nYou will again evaluate the new P-47 in combat. Its performance in the last large-scale mission on March 17th was not great. It is inferior to the IL-2 in terms of bomb load, firepower and survivability. However, P-47s do have generally superior flying characteristics and most importantly higher speed. The majority of our torpedo bombers will be flying at low level, and our P-47s will take over as their escorts after dropping their bombs. We do not expect many enemy fighters over the convoy. Quite a few Germans were shot down earlier, and they should now be flying on almost empty tanks. You may not encounter any enemy at all, in which case you should expend all your ammunition on enemy shipping. \n\nThe mission will progress as follows. You will take off at 10:25 and fly to sector N-13 (waypoint 4) at no higher than 50 meters of altitude and the speed no less than 450 km/h. You should be the first planes attacking the convoy in the new wave. Skip-bomb the escort ships from low level and then pop up to meet any enemy fighters and protect the planes that should be no more than a minute behind you. If you encounter an unexpected number of enemy fighters or ships, report your findings over the radio as accurately as possible. The group commander may be allowed to pull back towards the main group if the opposition is determined to be too strong. \n\nGood luck, and make every bomb count!\n\n
