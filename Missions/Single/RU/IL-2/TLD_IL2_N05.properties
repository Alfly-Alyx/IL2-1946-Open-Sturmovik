Description Date :  May 15th 1945\nTime : 05:15\nWeather : Good\nClouds : 900M\n\nTovarish,\n\nYesterday evening we totally demolished the German strong point. Now all is left is just a burning village.\n\nNow the same armoured elements have drove whole night and are now to cross the bridge Northwest of our airbase.\nHowever we expect to encounter heavy resistance of enemy ground units.\n\nWe do not know if after the defeat of the remaining luftwaffe fighters yesterday, if they will bring in some fighters.\nBut in case they do it is your task to destroy them.\n\nYour flight will consist out of four LaGG's.\nAlso just arrived from Russia the Ace Kollosovski. Well known and even awarded the Order of the Patriotic War 1st class.\n\nThe mission will be to patroll the battlefields airspace and make sure that if enemy dears to appear take them out.\n\nNote that I am currently calling with HQ in order to get a permission to send in IL2's.\n\nIf I'll get permission its your task to defend them agains enemy fighters.\n\nIF they appear.\n\nGood luck\n
