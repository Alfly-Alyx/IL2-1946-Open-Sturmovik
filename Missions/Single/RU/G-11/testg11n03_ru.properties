Name G-11 N3
Short G-11 MOD\n\nTraining Mission No. 3\n\n3-Plane Formation Tow by Pe-8 - Air Start\n
Description Fly mission number two before flying this one; at least read the instructions.\n\nEverything about the controls on the G-11 apply to this mission, but in this mission, you will be under more stress, as you will be sharing your tug with two other G-11 gliders.\n\nThe Petlyakov Pe-8 bomber could tow up to three G-11s, and you will be the number three in this formation.  That position gives you the benefit of being the glider furtherst behind, so you have a better view of what is going on.\n\nFor this mission, your objective is to fly behind the tug until it starts landing.  Your cable will detach, then land in the indicated base to complete your objective.  You must land, and be careful not to hit any of the other aircraft in the area.  Something fun to do is trying to beat the Pe-8 to the landing, and you can do that. But be sure to move over or you will be run over by the bomber-tug.\n\nEnjoy.\n\ndanzigzag for AAA
