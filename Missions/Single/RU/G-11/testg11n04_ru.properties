Name G-11 N4
Short G-11 MOD\n\nTraining Mission No. 4\n\nAirfield Assault & Paratrooper Exercise - Takeoff Start\n
Description Fly mission number two before flying this one; at least read the instructions.\n\nEverything about the controls on the G-11 apply to this mission, but in this mission, you will start on the ground.  A Li-2 will be your Tug.\n\nIn this exercise we will test our ability to completely take over an airfield using combined operations.  A Li-2 will lead the attack by dropping paratroopers right ahead of our formation.  Your Tug will in turn release weapon supplies to be used by the paratroopers in this special operation.  As your tug releases its cargo, you will be automatically detached.\n\nYour mission is to land on the indicated field as the paratroopers and cargo are on their way down.  You are carrying 11 special operation troopers equiped with machine guns and other equipment who will be conducting an assault against predetermined targets.  Don't mess around, land as soon as possible.\n\nRemember to land on the field to complete its mission, and get out of the way, because your Li-2 tug will be landing soon.  Ignore but do not interfere with the other land and air traffic; they are conducting other exercises.\n\nEnjoy.\n\ndanzigzag for AAA
