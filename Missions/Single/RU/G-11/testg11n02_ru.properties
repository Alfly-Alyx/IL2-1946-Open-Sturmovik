Name G-11 N2
Short G-11 MOD\n\nTraining Mission No. 2\n\nUnder Tow by Li-2 - Air Start\n
Description Fly mission number one before flying this one.\n\nIn this mission you will start in the air, and you will be under tow by a Lisunov Li-2 tug plane.  Unlike the German Me-321 'Gigant', in the G-11 you have the luxury of being able to select 'A' for Autopilot.\n\nAs in the Me-321, you only have three full controls while under tow:\n- Elevators\n- Rudders\n- Flaps (to help control speed)\n- NO Ailerons! (But you will notice you will have slight Roll control if you use them, so the FM is slightly nicer on this glider.)\n\nThere are two ways you can detach from the tug:\n- The tug is getting ready to land\n- Fly in a direction opposite to the tug (for example fly straight while the tug turns), and eventually the cable will snap\n\nYou cannot detach from the Tug using Autopilot as in the Me-321.\n\nFor this mission, your objective is to fly behind the tug until it starts landing.  Your cable will detach, then land in the indicated base to complete your objective.  You must land, and be careful not to hit any of the other aircraft in the area.\n\nEnjoy.\n\ndanzigzag for AAA\n
