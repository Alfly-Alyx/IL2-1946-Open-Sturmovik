Name G-11 N1
Short G-11 MOD\n\nTraining Mission No. 1\n\n"Glider Club" Free Fall\n
Description The G-11 is a military transport glider, but since it does not have any guns, and it has great flying characteristics, it is very enjoyable to fly.  Prior to World War Two, one way that governments got potential pilots interested in aviation was by promoting glider clubs.\n\nThis Glider Club is located in the top of a mountain.  The area you can use for takeoff is enclosed by the campfires.  Use the inclination to pick up speed and start flying at the mountain's edge.  You will have another pilot taking off at the same time, and you can use him as a guide.  But don't be too close to him or he may think you will hit him and possibly hit the mountain.  There are fixed cameras over your camp and over the landing zone.\n\nYour objective is to land in the indicate base.  You have plenty of time, so you can enjoy the flying characteristics of the G-11 glider.  You can do a full loop with as little speed as 250Km/h on a dive.  Use "T" to trail smoke (as in an air show).\n\nWARNING:  Do not approach 500Km/h or you will rip your wings off.  At 400Km/h your flaps will jam.  You can always jump with your parachute, but if you do that there is always a chance you will be facing a firing squad if you are found guilty of gross negligence.\n\nEnjoy, it is a beautiful evening over the mountains.\n\ndanzigzag for AAA\n
