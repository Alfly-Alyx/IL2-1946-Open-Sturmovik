This is a small election of my maps. they are designed for 10 hours a day running time to be played out over a series of months buy two forces.
each side had a battle commander who's job was to move objects around the map.

units movements and sighting ranges where limited, example, units could move 15km per week along roads and 5 pw accross terrain, with a sighting distance of 5kms.

guns and flack could only be moved if they had a truck to drag them and only mobile AA units could fire if a collum was in transit.

there was many other rules that had to be adheared to but this gives you an idea of ow i run my campaigns.
i had dedicated allied and axis pilots for the campaign and it all run very smoothly with a strict chain of command.

you are free to move anything and do what you like with these maps.

Rota is the best for acurate building work, it was made with the map that i posted in the canvas knights thread under the heading mission builder available.

i hope you enjoy these maps as the 30+ pilots did that took part in them.

just drop into your net/dogfight/missions folder.
