Name Hurricane Mk.II field mod. N1
Short LOW LEVEL ATTACK\n
Description LOW LEVEL ATTACK\n\n12nd April 1942\n\nWhile the Finnish advance has stopped at the northern suburbs of Leningrad, their siege of the city together with the Germans to the south is causing many thousands of casualties, particularly now that the thaw has removed the Ladoga Ice Road and the Lubyansk Operation looks as though it will be unsuccessful.\n\nYour mission is to attack an enemy anti-aircraft battery north-east of Leningrad that is preventing us from flying in supplies by day to our northern airstrips. As the battery mainly consists of larger guns for attacking high-altitude targets, you are advised to make a tree-top level attack and strafe their positions.\n
