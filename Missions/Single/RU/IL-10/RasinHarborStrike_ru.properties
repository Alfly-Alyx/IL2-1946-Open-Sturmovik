Since the early morning, Navy bomber and sturmovik units concentrated their strikes on enemy ports along the Eastern shores of Japanese occupied territory.\n\nIl-4 medium bombers struck the largest target in the area, the port of Rasin, during the night. Taking off before dawn and attacking just after sunrise, brand new Il-10s of the 26th ShAP followed up, attacking shipping moored in the harbor.. A large transport was sank, and the warehouses and port installations were on fire. However, the Sturmoviks were met with heavy fire from flak units around Rasin, and suffered higher than expected losses.\n\nThe next strike against Rasin was scheduled for 17:30. Six of the Il-10s were sent to attack the flak guns, and clear the way for more bombers. \n\nYour Objective: suppress enemy flak units.\n\nYour Flight: 6 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-50 + 4 RS-82.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:30 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. After take-off climb to 1400 meters. The strike group of Il-10 is already in the air. They will follow you. To ensure their safety, you have to try to destroy the flak guns in a single pass. \nReportedly, one flak battery is situated at the western edge of town, and the other is downtown, next to the pier. \n\nNote: In the Customization screen, please select the following camo scheme: Navy Green.\n\n
