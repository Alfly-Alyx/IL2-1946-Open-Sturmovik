Chuikov's infantry and Katukov's tanks were advancing on Berlin along Reichsstrasse 1.\n\nFrontline aviation units, despite poor weather conditions, continued to support the Soviet thrust towards the enemy's capital.\n\nWeather improved greatly on the morning of the 19th, and squadrons came to life, preparing for their next battle.\n\nAir reconnaissance spotted several new trains at the Fuerstenwalde rail station in the morning. The weather allows for an immediate response, which should destroy any military cargo before it can be unloaded and sent up to the front.\n\n59th Guards ShAP was sent to Fuerstenwalde with two zvenos.

The second flight will follow and attack the trains themselves.\n\nYour Objective: attack enemy railway junction at Fuerstenwalde.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Il-10.\n\nLoadout: 4 x FAB-100\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 04:40 heading West.
