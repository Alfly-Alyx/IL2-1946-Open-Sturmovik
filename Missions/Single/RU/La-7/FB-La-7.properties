Short       DEFEND THE BRIDGE TO BERLIN\n
Description DEFEND THE BRIDGE TO BERLIN\n\n15th April 1945\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThe 1st Guards Tank Army and the 8th Guards Army will tomorrow cross the Oder and breach the Seelow Heights, the final German defence line before Berlin. The timing of our attack will be known to the Germans - and they will do what they can to stop it.\n\nOur regiment, the 5. GvIAP (Guards Fighter Regiment), has been moved to a forward grass airstrip to provide cover for our forces tomorrow but also to try to prevent the Germans from attack our forces as they build up.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTime: 17:00\nWeather: Good, Clouds at 1200m\n\nSLt. Kisilev's flight of 4 La-7s has just been involved in a fight to protect a vital bridge south of Kustrin. A Fw-190/Ju-88 Mistel was sent to attack the bridge but it has been shot down, though we lost two aircraft to escorting Focke-Wulf fighters.\n\nThe remaining two aircraft are heading back to our base, out of ammunition and low on fuel. Take your flight and re-establish the patrol over the bridge - it is likely the Germans will try again. Be high enough to dive on any planes attacking the bridge but low enough to spot them.\n
