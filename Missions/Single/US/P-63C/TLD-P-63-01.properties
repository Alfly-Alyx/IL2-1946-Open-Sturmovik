Description Date : April 25th 1945 (fict)\nTime : 16:30\nWeather : Poor\nClouds : 1500M\n\nGentlemen, today we wil fly an offensive mission to defend our tankbusters. Your job will be to repell any Geman attack planes attempting to down our fighter bombers. \n\nWe will leave at 16:00 this afternoon. First we will head for a reagion south of Potsdam. Where our armoured units are sustaining heavy losses due enemy armoured counter attacks.\nFighterbombers of the 15th Fightergroup will do an attempt to destroy as much as possible enemy armour from the air as they can.\n\nIt is most likely that the enemy fighters will do an attempt to down our fighters.\n\nDefend our fighterbombers at all costs.\nGood luck\n
