Short Fighter sweep above Berlin *1945\n
Description Date : April 27th 1945 (fict)\nTime : 18:10\nWeather : Rainy\nClouds : 1500M\n\nGentlemen, for today we are gonna keep it simple. Just an ordinary fighter sweep. The German Luftwaffe is still recovering from the blow we have delivered at April the 16th this month.\n\nYour job will be to fly towards the Fuerstenwalde region and return. Most likely this will draw some enemy fighters into the air.\nYour speed will be quite low around 300KM/h. This way we will draw more enemy presence, however we will keep enough height to win enough speed in a dive if necessary.\n\nDestroy them. Clear enough? Fine!\n\nGood luck and happy hunting.\n
