Name YP-80 N1
Short BASE CLOSURE\n(Luftwaffe '46)\n
Description BASE CLOSURE (Luftwaffe '46)\n\n14th February 1946\n\nThe collapse of our frontline following the German recapture of Antwerp has allowed the enemy to move interceptor units closer to our bomber bases in England. \n\nWe have a big strike on the Frankfurt steelworks scheduled for 1000 hrs. You will attack the enemy interceptor base at Merzhausen at 0900, at which time we expect the enemy aircraft to be out of their concealed positions and getting ready for take-off. The base will be on high alert, so make your runs fast and devastating.\n\nPrevious experience has shown that the Germans often have fighter cover up while the interceptors are being prepared. Don't linger over the target.\n
