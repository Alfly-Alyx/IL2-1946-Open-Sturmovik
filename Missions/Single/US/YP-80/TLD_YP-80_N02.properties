Short *Luft 46* Helping your brothers in arms\n
Description Date : July 20th 1945\nWeather : Good\nClouds : 1100M\n\nGentlemen,\n\nAs you know the Soviet advance has stalled. Now on the Hungarian front the Soviets are trying to reopen their offensive on the weaker German left flanks nead the Balaton lake.\n\nYou guys will head towards their area of operations and help our brothers in arms to defend their ground attack aircraft.\n\nIt is most likley you will encounter the German bats again but no choice. Sending an request to Hitler not to use them doesn't seem to work.\n\nYour prime objective will be to make sure that the IL2's stay safe.\n\nAfter this you will follow the Soviets and you will land on their airfield.\n\nThis will be your area of operations for the next couple of weeks.\n\nAfter that you will head back home.\n\nGood luck\n
