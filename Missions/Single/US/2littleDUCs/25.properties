Description Well could you do it?\nIt's bad enough being in a plane over enemy territory let alone jumping out of one!\n\nLet's hope those guys had a soft landing. \n\nDate: Monday 5th June 1944\nTime: 23:50\nWeather: Hazy\nCloud Height: 3,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 28.5 miles\n\nFour of you are on a late-night mission as a favour to the RAF.\nThey are sending a glider squadron, towed by Dakotas, south east to Pegasus bridge.\n\nEscort the Dakotas. After they detach from their tugs, the gliders will be on their own.\n\nIt's unlikely that you'll encounter enemy fighters tonight but heavy flak is expected.\n\nYou'll notice that your Mustangs have received their new paint-jobs.\nOK so I wouldn't have gone for stripes either but apparantly they're this season's fashion must.\n\nGet a good sleep when you get home as I have a feeling things are about to hot up.\n\n*NEW SKIN *\n354thFG_355thFS_Invasion.bmp\n***************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n
