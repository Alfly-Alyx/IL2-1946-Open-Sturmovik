Short Thursday 16th December 1943\nAnother escort mission.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description The last few flights have been somewhat uneventful.\nThe heavies seem unable to hit a barn door with a banjo, but at least they are persistent.\n\nDate: Thursday 16th December 1943\nTime: 16:30\nWeather: Good\nCloud Height: 4,200 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 54.5 miles\n\nWe are escorting Fortresses on their fifth attempt at a successful bomb-run in the German city of Bremen.\n\nMaybe this time the B-17s will manage to hit their target but whether they do or not, let's make sure that our role in this fiasco remains exempt from criticism.\n\nIt's fifty minutes after you met up with the bombers and since reaching the French mainland there has been heavy resistance from ground fire, with much more expected.\n\nYou left French airspace about fifteen minutes ago and are flying at around 23,000 feet, east towards Bremen. You will be over the city in approximately fifteen minutes.\nAfter the bombs have been dropped, your group will head west-north-west to Calais and then north-west across the Channel on your way home.\n\nStay close to the bombers.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS.bmp\n************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*****************\n\n\n\n\n
