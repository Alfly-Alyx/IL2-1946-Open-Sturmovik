Name Good hunting
Short Saturday 12th February 1944\nAs a brief respite from our usual mission, a pair of you are taking part in the early morning hunt for German recon planes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description I'm afraid I have some grave news for you gentlemen.\nOn a sortie over Frankfurt yesterday, your Commanding Officer Colonel Kenneth R. Martin was involved in a collision with a Messerschmitt 109.\nNeither aircraft survived the crash and neither pilot bailed out.\n\nWith immediate effect, the newly promoted Lieutenant Colonel James H. Howard will take over as 355th Fighter Squadron's Commanding Officer.\n\nDate: Saturday 12th February 1944\nTime: 6:30\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Height: 4,900 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 29 miles\n\nAs a brief respite from our usual mission, a pair of you are taking part in the early morning hunt for German recon planes.\n\nThe Luftwaffe have been making frequent early morning sorties across the Channel in their Heinkel 111s or Junkers 88s.\nThey usually fly alone or in pairs.\nIf you encounter one watch out for the rear gunner, he can easily disable the engine of our P-51s.\n\nThe reconnaissance planes have often been intercepted at around 16,000 feet, so you are to climb to that altitude before you circle the Isle of Wight.\n\nAfter yesterday's unfortunate incident, I don't want to see any 'heroic' antics out there. Your own survival is the first priority. If you are able to engage the enemy without jeopardising your own safety or that of your wingman then do so, but otherwise you should stand off.\n\nGood hunting.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS.bmp\n************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*****************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
