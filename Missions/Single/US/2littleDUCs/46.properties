Description Well I don't think much of the Thunderbolt in an out and out dogfight.\nIt's potential as a ground pounder can't be underestimated though.\nWe'll just have to play the best game we can with the cards we've been dealt.\nDon't worry I am still lobbying hard for us to be re-equipped with the latest Mustang.\n\nDate: Saturday 18th November 1944\nTime: 17:20\nWeather: Poor\nCloud Height: 3,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 36 miles\n\nSome of the more observant amongst you may have noticed the Messerschmitt parked in a shed on the airfield.\nI want a volunteer to fly it!\nYou needn't worry about flying under the banner of the swastika. All of those filthy markings have been removed.\n\nGood!\nI'm glad you stepped forward, this job is right up your street.\n\nI reckon that you could fly right over the airfield near Argentan and deliver a present, without the enemy suspecting anything until it's too late.\n\nWe've loaded the biggest bomb we could fit into the rack on the underbelly of the 109, so you should be able to do some real damage.\nEnemy planes parked on the ground should be the focus of your attack.\n\nTake off and climb to 3,200 feet. Remember, your instruments will be in metric so you're aiming for about 1,000 meters.\n\nYou'll fly directly over Falaise on the 12 minute trip to Argentan.\n\nIf enemy fighters do engage you, your best course of action may be just to get the hell out of there!\nOne man can't take on the entire Luftwaffe can he?\n\nIf any of the other Allied squadrons that may be in the area spot you, you'd better steer clear of them. If they see a lone 109 they're bound to attack. How are they to know it's one of our guys at the controls?\n\nWe've set up a temporary landing strip for you on a north-facing road between Esquay and Evrecy. We've clearly marked it's loction on your map.\nOn approach look for the landing lights.\nI would strongly recommend landing there as opposed to winging it all the way back home as we can't guarantee your safety if you're spotted by another flight or a trigger happy gunner.\n\nSKIN * DEFAULT *\n***********************\nMARKINGS - WHAT MARKINGS?!?\n*******************************************\n\n\n
