Description Those ships didn't stand a chance did they?\nAppearing out of the cloud like that, you must have given them quite a shock.\n\nLet's get on with surprising the enemy some more.\n\nDate: Monday 15th May 1944\nTime: 13:35\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Height: 3,200 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 31.5 miles\n\nYou're on an old-style Circus operation today - but one with a slight difference.\n\nA Circus operation consists of a small force of bombers accompanied by a heavy fighter escort and is designed to draw the Luftwaffe into a dogfight.\nWe're doing things slight differently today though as our 'bombers' are actually Thunderbolts flying slowly across the Channel at around 16,000 feet.\n\nEnemy Radar operators might believe the slow-flying Thunderbolts to be light bombers and vector fighters to intercept them.\nWon't they be surprised when they are attacked by not only the escorts but the 'bombers' as well?\n\nYou're cruising at around 16,000 feet en route to Caen.\nMake a sweep of the town keeping up the pretence of providing cover to the 'bombers'.\n\nIf the Luftwaffe come up to meet you engage them at will.\n\nOnce you're sure that the area is clear a reciprocal course will bring you home.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS_Aged.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n
