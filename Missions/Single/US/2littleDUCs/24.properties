Short Saturday 3rd June 1944\nTonight we're to escort a crack RAF parachute squadron across the Channel and into enemy territory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description This morning we received an important telegram from top-brass.\n\nIt says:\n"355th FS awarded Distinguished Unit Citation STOP Awarded for exemplary service between December 43 and May 44 STOP Well done STOP"\n\nSo there it is. Command has taken notice of our reports over the last few months and have given credit where credit was due.\n\nWell done guys, keep up the good work.\n\nDate: Saturday 3rd June 1944\nTime: 22:45\nWeather: Clear \nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 63 miles\n\nTonight we're to escort a crack RAF parachute squadron across the Channel and into enemy territory.\n\nMissions such as this are a sure sign that the invasion is imminent.\n\nOur job is simple; the same can't be said of those brave men who will leap to their fate over occupied Normandy.\n\nAfter take-off climb to around 4,000 feet where you will meet up with the Dakotas which are transporting the Paras.\nThey will be climbing to 13,000 feet, heading south-west.\n\nProtect the Dakotas and spare a thought for those men making the jump tonight.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS_Aged.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n\n
