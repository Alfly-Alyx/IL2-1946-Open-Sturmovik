Description Date: Wednesday 3rd January 1945\nTime: 15:30\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Height: 5,000 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 40 miles\n\nYes I know Ryan's out there.\nI know it's cold and it'll be dark soon.\n\nThe thing is, there are rules for stuff like this.\n\nI can't just let you take one of the fighters out to try saving pilot Ryan.\n\nAs it happens there is a Jug on the runway primed and ready to go...\nIf anyone was crazy enough to borrow it and try to rescue Chuck, he could be away immediately.\n\nBy the time he was discovered missing it would be too late to react.\n\nIf someone did go out but didn't make it back, my report would have to say that the P-47 was "Taken Without Consent."\n\nDo you get my drift?\n\nThat person had better make it worth the hassle and bring Ryan back home.\n\nHe's somewhere between Ouren and St Vith.\nIf he hears a plane approaching from the west he'll most likely start a fire to attract their attention.\nI guess that'll be another Thunderbolt written-off!\n\nWe're talking about crossing enemy lines, finding the smoke signal, making a wheels down landing in the field and then taking off and getting all the way home with two people in the cockpit of a P-47!\n\nI'm not sure it's even possible...\n\nSKIN 354thFG_355thFS_P-47.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*******************\n
