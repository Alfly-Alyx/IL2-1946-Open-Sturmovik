Name Preparations have begun
Short Saturday 5th May 1944\nThe preparations for the liberation of France have begun in earnest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description So after the latest reshuffle we've ended up at Lashendon airfield in Kent.\nWe can't complain can we guys?\nThe local ale house is comfy enough anyway.\n\nAs we prepare to liberate France the nazis are no closer to predicting where the main thrust of the attack will take place.\n\nWe'll have multiple roles in the coming weeks.\n\nAs well as the usual bomber escorts, on occasion we will merely fly into enemy airspace at random points along the French coast, so as to confuse the enemy about our primary interests.\n\nWe will also be attempting to limit the effectiveness of enemy troops based in France. This will be achieved simply by eliminating any and all viable ground targets we're able to seek out behind enemy lines.\n\nIf we're lucky we'll be able to severely weaken the Luftwaffe as well. We'll destroy their planes on the ground as well as knocking them out of the sky.\n\nAnd so to today's mission.\n\nDate: Saturday 5th May 1944\nTime: 8:30\nWeather: Hazy \nCloud Height: 3,500 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 57.5 miles\n\nOne of our Recon planes has spotted a Nazi supply column moving eastwards towards Calais.\nIf you hurry you can take them out before they reach sanctuary.\n\nTake-off from Runway One and climb to 5,000 feet.\nAs you fly over 'The White Cliffs' turn so that you're heading due south.\n\nEven at top-speed the Nazis shouldn't have driven much further than Boulogne.\n\nTake out the column and get yourselves back home.\nDon't let their cargo reach Calais.\n\nSKIN  354thFG_355thFS_Aged.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n
