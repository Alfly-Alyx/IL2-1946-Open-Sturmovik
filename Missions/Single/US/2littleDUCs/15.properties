Description I reckon you boys ought to be thankful to those Spitfire pilots.\nYou could all have been wiped out had they not been passing.\nThat was yesterday, it's in the past now.\n\nDate: Monday 6th March 1944\nTime: 20:25\nWeather: Clear\nCloud Height: 3,200 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 34 miles\n\nThe French resistance movement have notified Intelligence of a Nazi stronghold in Caen.\nThe Huns have taken up residence in Caen Castle.\nYou are on the way to serving their eviction notice.\nApparently the people of France feel that this is an acceptable sacrifice.\n\nYou are carrying a pair of one thousand pound bombs which you'll drop on the Castle.\nDon't worry too much about destroying an historic building, it's suffered far worse in its history.\nIn any case, destroying the castle and the enemy inside is preferable to forfeiting this opportunity.\n\nThe castle is south-east of your current location and should take you around ten minutes to reach.\n\nAlthough you're flying under cover of darkness you'll probably need to descend to around 6,000 feet in order to locate the target, therefore you'll be foregoing the element of surprise.\n\nStay alert. Fighters will almost certainly come up to meet you.\n\n*NEW SKIN *\n354thFG_355thFS_Aged.bmp\n***********************************\nMARKINGS ON\n******************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
