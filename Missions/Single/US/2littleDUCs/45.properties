Name Thunderbolt and Lightning
Short Friday 7th November 1944\nMore ground pounding today then but not for you.\nYou'll be escorting the Lightnings from the 20th Fighter Group who are about to fly overhead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
Description You were warned that there was an enemy airfield just outside Argentan.\nIt appears that some of you were too busy playing with your new toys to notice the Focke Wulfs as they approached.\nAt least we think they were Focke Wulfs but they differed somewhat from the 190s we've encountered to date.\n\nYou're lucky to have escaped alive.\nToo bad the same can't be said for the others.\n\nDate: Friday 7th November 1944\nTime: 07:15\nWeather: Good\nCloud Height: 1,650 feet\nApproximate distance to target: 27 miles\n\nMore ground pounding today then but not for you.\nYou'll be escorting the Lightnings from the 20th Fighter Group who are about to fly overhead.\n\nTake off and climb to around 4,000 feet where you should meet up with the P-38s as they turn towards Falaise in the south east.\n\nYou will reach the target zone after approximately 10 minutes.\n\nA German tank division south of Falaise is the target.\nYou must ensure that the Lightnings are able to destroy the tanks without fear of an attack from above.\n\nThe extra ammunition you're carrying today should mean you'll have no excuses if the enemy does launch a counter attack and if not, you can use it on any ground targets you fancy.\n\nSKIN 354thFG_355thFS_P-47.bmp\n*******************************************\nMARKINGS ON\n*******************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
