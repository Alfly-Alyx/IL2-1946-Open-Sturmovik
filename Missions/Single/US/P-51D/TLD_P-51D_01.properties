Description Date : May 1st 1945\nTime : 17:30\nWeather : Good\nClouds : 1000M\n\nGentlemen, I have got some good news for you. Our Friends in Europe report that the war in Europe is getting to an end. The Russians are currently battling Berlin and for as far as I know we should be glad they are doing it because the losses suffered to take even a single street is unheard.\n\nDespite our succeses in Europe we still do not gain a total controll of our Japanese oponents.\n\nSo just like April the 16th in europe May the 1st will be our domination day in the sky. You will be part of a major strike force agains all near Japanese airfields.\n\nYour flight will consist out of sixtheen aircrafts.\nEifght P 51D's and eight P 47D's all armed for ground attack purposes.\n\nYour role will be a little different than those of the jugs. First you will have to drop your bombs at Japanese planes after that you are to defend the Jugs from any Japanese plane attempting to attack the Jugs which will try to do destroy as much as possible ground targets.\n\nGood luck Gentlemen, and let this be our judgement day in the air.\n\nRemember, Uncle Sam is counting on you.\n
