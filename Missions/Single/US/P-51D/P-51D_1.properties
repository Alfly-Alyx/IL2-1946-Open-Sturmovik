Description COMRADES IN ARMS\n\n23rd June 1944\n\nMustangs of the 4th Group have escorted B-17s of the 100th Bomb Group on a mammoth eleven and a half hour shuttle mission from England, across Germany, hitting an oil refinery in Poland and finally landing in the Soviet Union. Now the US aircraft have been dispersed to various Russian airfields and are being fuelled and bombed up for the return journey.\n\nThe Russian Yak fighters at the base are starting to scramble it looks as though the Germans may be about to take advantage of this juicy target. Better get up there and help!\n\n
