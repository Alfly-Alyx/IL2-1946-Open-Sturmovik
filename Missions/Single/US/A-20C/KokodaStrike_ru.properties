Despite the horrific heat, humidity, and constant supply problems, we were able to slow the Japanese down a good distance from Port Moresby, halt their advance completely through constant positional battles, and then launch a massive counter attack that pushed them back to Owen Stanley range. \n\nOur forward units are still in contact with the enemy, slowly advancing towards the key location, the village of Kokoda. Air units continue to support their advance. \n\nYour Objective: The village of Kokoda houses several military supply warehouses, and retreating Japanese units continue to amass in the area. HQ requested a bombing strike on Kokoda on the morning of the 3rd of October. \n\nYour Flight: 4 x \u0410-20\u0421.\n\nLoadout: 2 x 300 + 4 x 300lb bombs\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 10:30 heading South-East.
