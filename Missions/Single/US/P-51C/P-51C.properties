Name P-51C-NT N1
Short DIVER\n
Description DIVER\n\n17th November 1944\n\nGerman V-1 (codename:Diver) and V-2 attacks on London have now killed upwards of 4000 people. The V-1 menace has been reduced by the pace of the Allied advance but some are still getting through. Now a photographic reconnaisance Spitfire has identified a V-1 site in the Low Countries.\n\nYou are tasked with the destruction of this site but be warned: a high concentration of anti-aircraft fire is to be expected. The site will be well camouflaged so watch where your Squadron Leader attacks and follow him in. Enemy fuel tanks and trucks are your main targets.\n
