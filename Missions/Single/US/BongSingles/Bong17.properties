Name On the flight home
Short Fictional, fun mission that could have happened.\n
Description True to his word General Kenney sends Richard home to Wisconsin.\n\nThis is a non-historical mission.  \n\nLets say that Bong hitches a ride home in a SBD and has an encounter along the way to Hawaii.  This is a bonus mission, not one that really happened.  \n\nTry doing it by being the tail gunner.  If that doesn't work fly yourself.\n\nAfter this mission you can go play "Deer Hunter"  because that is exactly what Bong did.  He went back home and bagged a doe.\n
