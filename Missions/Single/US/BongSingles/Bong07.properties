Description April 14th, 1943\n\n9th Fighter Squadron, 49th Fighter Group\n\nScramble to Goodenough Island.  Where are they?\n\nAt one time 6 Zeros are on Bong's tail.  His plane was hit by a 20mm shell from a "black zero".\n\nLetter to Mom April 13th, 1943\n\nWell, mail service is improving. Got your March 25th letter yesterday and one from Jerry with the music to Sleepy Time Gal on it.  Music is slightly mixed up because she didn't do a very accurate job of copying, bit it is clear and easy to read. Glad to hear it is warming up after all that snow that you said you got.\n\nUse skin P38J-9 unless your skill is not as good as Richard Bong's.\n\n
