Description December 27, 1942\nBriefing at 1130 hours \n\nTO:  39th Fighter Squadron Commander\n\nThe big brass is honked off about the Japanese raid yesterday on Dobodura airfield.\n\nToday, they want your P-38s to fly high cover at the field & Cape Endaiadere where our troops are landing and to knock anything down that comes your way.\n\nCoast watchers are reporting fighters & Vals headed there from Lae so you may not have long to wait.\n\nWe also have information the Japanese army has for the first time committed aircraft to New Guinea.  We believe the experienced 11th Sentai flying Ki-43 fighters has been transferred to Lae & Rabaul.   Expect to see them today.\n\nGood luck on what is looking like your first major engagement with P-38s.\n\n\nLt. Col. RICHARD A. LEGG\n35th Fighter Group\n\n\nRichard Ira Bong is a farm boy from Poplar Wisconsin, which is just about as far north as you can get without running into Lake Superior.  Just go to Duluth, MN and head east on highway 2.  You can't miss it.  He grew up milking cows and bailing hay.  \n\nIf you do make it to Poplar be sure and visit the Richard I. Bong Memorial just north of the highway.  There's a P38 on display along with small museum dedicated to the Richard Bong story. \n\nThis first mission has been "lifted" intact from Kokoda Campaign by VBF-80.  I was able to deconstuct their mission to figure out how to make the others.  Thank you for your work.\n\nUse skin P38J_39_FS to start your career.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n
