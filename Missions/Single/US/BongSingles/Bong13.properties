Name No Credit Where Credit is Due.
Short Bong flames two Betty's but because of poor visability they count as probables.\n
Description 9th Fighter Squadron, 49th Fighter, Group Army Air Forces,  APO 503\n\n6th September, 1943\n\nPatrol over Morobe, New Guinea.\n\nLog book notation of this day was this:\n\nShot down two Betty Bombers between Hopoi and Finschaven.  Got my right engine, right tire, rudder trim tabs shot up and cracked up plane a Marilinan on landing.  Later revised to "Probably" Shot Down (not accepted not seen to crash).\n\nBong was known to "give away Nips".  This war time racial slur meant that Bong would severely criple a plane then let his wing man finish it off an in the process teaching them how it was done.  A number of his wing men complained to General Kenney that Bong would then make them take the credit for the kill thus making Bongs total much lower.  General Kenney estimated that Bong did this about one out of every 2 he took credit for.  Do the math,  this would have made his actual total 60 kills.\n\nThis was the only mission that Bong did not land at his home field.\n\nUse skin P38J-16.\n
