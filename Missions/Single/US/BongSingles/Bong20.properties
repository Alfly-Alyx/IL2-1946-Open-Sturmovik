Description HEADQUARTERS V FIGHTER COMMAND\nOffice of the A-2               A-2/RIB/wfm\n\n3rd of March, 1944\n\nMission: Fighter Sweep\n\nSweep the area around Tadji.\n\nNeal Kirby, in the race keep up with Bong, took the last chance he will ever take and was shot down.   After shooting down 2 zeros, 3 more zeros were on his tail.  His wingmen got 2 of them but the third one got Kirby.  He was low and slow in P-47.\n\nBong got 2 on this mission and Tommy Lynch got 2 also.  That's 24 for Bong and 21 for Lynch.  Of the eight planes encountered the two aces shot down 4.  Not bad for a days work.\n\nLetter home to Mom.\n\n"Well another day another 10 dollars or so.  Very unexciting day and nothing new the last few days.  Flew about 55 hours last month after I got back.  Not bad for a man flying a desk.  I'm still healthy, although I've lost from 7 to 10 pounds since I came back here.  Takes time to get used to the food, after eating all those good things at home."\n \nUse skin P38L-Marge22 again.\n\n
