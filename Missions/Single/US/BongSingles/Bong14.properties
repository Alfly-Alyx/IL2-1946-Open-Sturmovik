Name Always check your six!
Short Bong gets a Dinah that never even sees what hit him.\n
Description 9th Fighter Squadron, 49th Fighter, Group Army Air Forces,  APO 503\n\n2nd of October, 1943\n\nMIssion:  Escort B-25s and B-26s to Cape Hoskins.\n\nKeep your eyes open.\n\nDick had to wait a long time to get a replacement aircraft and was grounded until this flight.  Mean while the race was on.  Neal Kirby had eight kills in his P-47 while Bong waited for his plane.   After this flight  Bong had 17 kills.  Nine days later Kirby shot down 7 in one flight but because of his gun cameras running out of film he only got credit for 6 and earned the Medal of Honor.  Kirby was now at 14 kills.\n\nGeneral Kenney told Bong that he could go home on leave to Wisconsin when his tally was 20.  He could  shoot some deer instead of Japs.  Dick grinned, and said "if I can get me a plane I ought to make it by the middle of November when the season opens."\n\nUse skin P38J-16 for this mission.  Unless you've done better.......or worse.\n
