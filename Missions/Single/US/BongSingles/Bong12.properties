Name Monday is wash day.
Short Bong tried several times to catch Washing Machine Charlie.  He was a pain in the ass.\n
Description Washing Machine Charlie was a minor nuisance.  Almost every night Charlie would come over the airfield late at night and drop a bomb,  Then disappear.  He never did any damage but was a psychological warfare ploy.  His plane was old and had a unique sound.  Hence the name.\n\nHe is hard to find.  Hopefully the search lights will pick him out for you.  No cheating. No icons.  Dick never did get him.\n\nUse skin P38J-16\n
