Description 9th FIGHTER SQUADRON, 49TH FIGHTER GROUP\nARMY AIRFORCES\nAPO 72\n\nMission No. 439, November 11th, 1944. 9th Fitron. \n49th Fitgp. 5 P-38's\n\nTocloban, Leyte, Philippines\n\nEscort C47's to Hemenon Island\n\nTime of attack:  12:35/I. Altitude: 10,000 feet.\n\nThese two victories were the last Bong was to have in November.  In slightly over two weeks of fighting near Tocloban Dick had added four Oscars and 2 Zekes to his score.  Given the Fith Air Force's need for experienced pilots at Leyte - and Dick's love of combat - readers may wonder why he made no further claims in November. The answer helps scotch criticism that Dick enjoyed free rein to run up large number of kills.\n\n"The months of November and December were tough ones for me, trying to keep Dick from flying too many combat mission.  General McArthur, General Arnold and everyone in the Fifth Air force from my sergeant to General Whitehead kept saying  'why don't you send him home before he gets knocked off?'  Dick wanted to go for 50 victories.  I said 'no, at 40 you go home.'\n\nThe reason he didn't fly more than 9 days in November and December was  that I kept him on the ground unless I needed him on an especially important mission." General Kenney \n\nUse skin P38L-34 for this one.\n
