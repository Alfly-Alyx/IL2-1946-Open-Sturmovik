Short March 11th, 1943\n\nBong tangels with a mess of Zeros.\n
Description March 11th 1943\n\n9th Fighter Squadron, 49th Fighter Group\n\nSCAMBLE!!   THEY'RE HERE!\n\nAt one time 9 Zeros are on Bong's tail.  What did he do?  What will you do?  His plane looked like swiss cheese after this one.  He made it home on one engine.\n\nLetter to Mom March 12th, 1943\n\n"Well, by this time, I mean the time you receive this, the papers will have said all about our battle yesterday.  Getting pretty warm over here.  Brought me up to 8 yesterday, but I came close to getting knocked out myself.  However, I'm as healthy as ever and still flying."\n\n"I'm in good health yet.  I say that because some of the boys are getting Malaria lately.  I suppose I'll get it too. The doggone jungle is sure full of insects.  Some of them are beautiful, but I don't appreciate them at all.  We've got a river here and go swimming every other day."\n\nUse skin P38J-6 for this one.\n\n\n
