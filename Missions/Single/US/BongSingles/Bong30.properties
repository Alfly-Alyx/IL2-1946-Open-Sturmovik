Description 431ST FIGHTER SQUADRON 475TH FIGHTER GROUP\nAPO 72\n15TH December, 1944\t\t\n\n(HQ. V FTR. COMMAND\n\nA. \tMission # 1-620; 15 December, 1944; 431st Fighter Squadron; 4 P-38's.\n\nB. Fighter sweep to Negros Island.\n\n\n"Dear Mom, \n\nThe weather is horrible.  Reminds me of spring back home, only not so cold.  Steady drizzle of rain.  I was going to fly this morning, but it looks like I won't now.\n\nYou of course know that General MacArthur presented the Congressional Medal of Honor to me a few days ago and you probably know that I got another Nip plane on the 15th making it 39 now.  Seems like one or two Nips doesn't make any differencer anymore.  Major McGuire is doing his darnedest to pass me or gain on me, anyway, but since I am living with him at the present, why he has a hard time of it because I fly when he does and we break even."\n\nAt the Medal of Honor ceremony MacArthur, ever the showman,  had a surprise up this sleve as he discarded his prepared text and ad-libbed a short speech of congratulations which Kenney, amoung others, thought was one of his finest.  Placing his hand on Dick's shoulder's he intoned: "Major Richard Ira Bong, who has ruled the air from New Guinea to the Philippines, I now induct you into the society of the bravest of the brave, the wearers of the Congressional Medal of Honor of the United States."  MacArthur then pinned the medal on Dick's uniform, the two shook hands, exchanged salutes and the ceremony ended.\n\nUse skin P38L-38 if you got em.\n
