Name Fatal Heroics
Short This is Bong's last flight.  He is testing the Armies newest jet when something goes fatally wrong.\n
Description "It was a terrible sight" (August 6, 1945)\n\nThe Lockeed- P-80 would take the Air Force into the jet age, a transition that was fraught with danger.  Since the intial flight of the Shooting Star on September 13, 1944 the program had been plagued with problems.  Lockeed was under tremendous pressure to test, refine and put the aircraft into pre-production.  Luftwaffe jet and rocket fighters were already in action in Europe by the fall of 1944 when the first pre-production YP-80 was flown\n\nPressure to get the aircraft into production was compounded by design, engine and production problems.  Only a month after the P-80's first flight, test pilot Milo Burcham experienced engine failure shortly after take off and crashed to his death on October 20, 1944. Over a dozen accidents, several of them fatal, followed Burcham's crash.\n\nIn order to meet the production schedule, Lockeed began to fly the P-80 out of Burbank, CA testing facility.  This facility was surrounded by residential housing.  This left few options for emergency landing.\n\nOn this date Dick Bong's engine failed shortly after take off.  In the last moments over Burbank, fighting to pilot his crippled aircraft away from innocent civilians, Dick Bong demonstrated once and for all that he was indeed "one of the bravest of the brave"\n\nThere is a chance that you can eject from the plane and  get out alive, but you will have failed in this mission if your crippled plane crashes into any housing units around the field.  Make sure no one will get harmed before you eject.  It was the last thing that  Richard Ira Bong did.  No one else was harmed in the crash.  You get one chance.\n
