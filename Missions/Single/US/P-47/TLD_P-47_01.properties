Short Ludwigsfelde factory raid *1945\n
Description Date : March 5th 1945\t\nTime : 18:00\nWeather : Foggy but still reasonable visibillity\nClouds : 1000M\n\nGentlemen,\nOne of our recon airplane's has just returned from Ludwigsfelde. It had been send out to gather some info about the Ludwigsfelde area. \n\nThe intel report goes as following. : The Germans have located an arms plant at the Ludwigsfelde area. The factory seems to of average size and it should produce some reasonable amount of arms each day. The productivity of the factory is clearly visible due the amount of vehicles moving around and trains that depart and arrive each twenty minutes. And that's constant around the clock.\nThe arms factory is located North East of the Ludwigsfelde village and is heavily covered by flak.  We have spotted severall flak 88 belts around the plant. As well some smaller 20MM flak vehicles located in and around the village. The factory enjoys the fighter cover of an nearby airfield.\nWhat we can make up out of the photographs we have made are around 20 Me 109 aircraft exact type unknown and some of around 8 FW 190 aircraft type also unknown.\n\nGentlemen, this says enough. You have assumable seen the ground crew mounting some ground attack weapons under your aircraft so it will be ground pounding for you guys today.\n\nWe won't leave all too late because of the view that is decreasing by dark and we need to get this factory out of business as soon as possible.\n\nYour targets :\n\nFlight one ( 1 - 4) will move to the upper side of the plant where located a large number of transport vehicles. \nFlight two ( 5 - 8) will attack the warehouses at the rear of the plant.\nFlight three (9 - 12) will attack the upper factory complex buildings. (*player's flight)\nFlight four (13 - 16) will attack the trains that should be located at the rail yard.\nFlight five (a1 - a4) will attack the lower factory buildings.\n\nWell that should be clear for now.\n\nI hope you will all have a safe return.\nGood luck boys.\n\n\n
