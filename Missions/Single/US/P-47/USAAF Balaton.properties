Description \n317th Fighter Squadron, 325th Fighter Group, 15th Air Force\nLesina, Italy\nApril 12th, 1944\n9:45 PM\n\nGentlemen, tomorrow we will be participating in a large-scale attack on Luftwaffe bases in Hungary. This is our biggest mission since the January 30th action at Udina. The whole of 325th Fighter Group, as well as the 1st and 82nd Fighter Groups will perform simultaneous low-level attacks on their respective targets. There will also be B-17s and B-24s bombing their targets from high altitude. \n\nGermans are feeling a little too comfortable in Hungary. Their fighter bases are still too far from our bases to allow for frequent attacks. Our P-38s visited Budapest just 9 days ago, and our only other attack on Hungarian targets was way back on February 2nd. Our mission today is to overwhelm the Jerry with simultaneous attacks from all directions, and destroy their air force on the ground and in the air.\n\nOur squadron's target is the Tapolca airfield. Aerial reconnaissance shows multiple transport and bomber aircraft parked out in the open. The airfield is defended only with light flak, however expect medium to heavy opposition in the air. You may encounter planes from different air forces: German, Hungarian, and possibly Romanian or even Russian. Brush up on your aircraft recognition. In addition to 109s you may encounter Me-210s and 410s, IAR fighters, Italian Fiat and Re-2000 planes, and more. From our side there will be P-38s, P-47s, B-17s and B-24s - so make sure it's an enemy before you open fire!\n\nYou will approach target at low level, 50 feet or less, to avoid detection by radar. Attack the airfield, destroy everything you can on the ground, and aggressively engage enemy planes in the air. Once all targets in the immediate vicinity of the airfield are destroyed and fuel situation permitting, commence attacks on any other targets of opportunity. There are several busy roads in the area as well as a railroad. \n\nGood luck gentlemen. Take off is tomorrow at 0530. After crossing the Rumanian border stay on heading of 100 degrees and it should put you over the Balaton lake at around 07:45. After approximately 5 miles over the lake you will see three rivers mouths in close proximity to your left. Turn to heading between the second and third river and it should put you right over the airfield.\n\n
