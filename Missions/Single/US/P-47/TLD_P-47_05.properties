Short Firefighter near the end (1945)\n
Description Date : May 25st 1945\nTime : 15:00\nWeather : Good\nClouds : 1000\n\nAllright folkes,\n\nFor today your target will be a bridge near C2.\nOur forces are desperately trying to crosses but the enemy does all effort he can to prevent it from happening.\n\nYour main goal will be to destroy the guns at the other side of the river. Intelligence tells us a whole battery is located in the area. The men located at the other side tell us they are right. \n\nYour job will be to destroy that guns and make sure our forces will be able to cross the river.\n\nGood luck\n\n* by this date actions like these in the Austrian alps did happen but not that often. And not in such big scale. The posibillity of air support by this time was very slim and therefore you can consider this mission as semi-historical.\n
