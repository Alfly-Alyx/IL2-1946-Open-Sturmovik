Short Patroll over Germany (1945)\n
Description Date : March 2nd 1945\nTime : 18:00\nWeather : Poor\nClouds : 1500 M\n\nGentlemen,\n\nYesterday our fighterbombers have attacked a German HQ near Potsdam and Berlin.\n\nHowever we faced heavy enemy resistance and suffered heavy losses.\n\nThough some of fighterbombers managed to reach the HQ. But we are not sure if any real damage has been done.\n\nSo your task for today will be verifieing the damage.\n\nYou will head for that sector and try to report the situation down there.\n\nEstimated that there will only be little enemy resistance at this moment.\n\nGood luck\n
