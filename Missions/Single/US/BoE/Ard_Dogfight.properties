Short Ardennes Dogfight\nDecember 16, 1944\n\nPlayer flies a P-51\n
Description December 16, 1944\n900 hours\n\nDecember 16, 1944. Today the 5th and 6th German Panzer armies broke into the Ardennes through the Loshein Gap against our divisions protecting the region. The Sixth Panzer army attacking our V Corps at Elsborn Ridge accomplished little. At the same time the 5th Panzer Army, attacking the VIII Corps exploited it's lack of experience and is making quick advance. We must slow the Germans down in order to organise defense of Bastogne and prepare a counterattack. The task of allied tactical airpower will be constant attacks against enemy rear areas and securing air superiority.\n\nTarget for today is going to be Dochamps. We continue to seek out enemy planes in the air and on the ground, and as the area has seen increased amount of fighting in the recent day there is a high chance of encountering enemy planes in the air.\nThe main goal for today is control over city's airspace. We have very little idea of the actual enemy strength you might encounter in the area. We do believe however we're sending enough planes to counter anything the enemy might put up in the air.\n\nGood luck!\n\n
