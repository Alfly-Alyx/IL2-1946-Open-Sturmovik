Name BoF - Blenheims attack bridgehead at Sedan
Short The Wehrmacht has reached the Meuse in it's lightning invasion of France. The French defenders have destroyed the bridges over the Meuse, but Guderian's panzers are crossing the river via a pontoon bridge.\n\nRAF Blenheims with French and RAF fighter escorts must now destroy the pontoon bridge to stop the German juggernaut.\n
Description 13 May, 1940.\n\nIn spite of the destruction of the bridges over the Meuse, the German advance continues. During the night of 12 May, Guderian personally supervised the construction of a pontoon bridge over the river, so the panzers are establishing a bridgehead on the west bank. All of France lies open before them.\n\nThis is the last chance for the French and BEF forces to stop the German advance. There is an opportunity to destroy the panzers as they cluster around the bridgehead. \n\n170 Blenheims escorted by French and British fighters will attack the bridge and the panzers on either side of the river. Heavy flak and fighter resistance can be expected.\n\n\n\n\n
