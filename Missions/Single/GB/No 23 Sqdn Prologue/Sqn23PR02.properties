Name 02 : The Midnight Rider
Short April 1941, Boston Mk.III : Night Intruders\n
Description No. 23 squadron, South East Egland, April 1941.\n\nWe just recieved reports from London that a small group of night bombers raided the dock areas. This is a good opportunity for us to catch Jerry unaware and chalk up some kills. \n\nAcording to the data provided by our radar installations, these planes were coming from Nuncq-Framecourt in France. \n\nWe will fly to Framecourt, hoping to get there before the enemy bombers and catch them with their pants down as they come in to land.\n\nOur Bostons have been loaded with 4 500.lbs eggs to drop on any bomber that might already be on the ground when we arrive, or any other target of interest.\n\nUnfortunately the surprise efffecy will not be complete.  This won't be the first time we attempt to take the enemy by surprise in this manner, and the airfield defenses will be expecting us. We must be extremely wary of ground fire. \n\nPlayer skin : A20C Havoc MkI YP-P 23 Sqn RAF.bmp, \nmarkings off.\n
