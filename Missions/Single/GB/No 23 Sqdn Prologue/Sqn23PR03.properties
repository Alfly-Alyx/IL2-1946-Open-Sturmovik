Name 03 : Night Time Is The Right Time
Short September 1942, Mosquito NF MK.II : Night Rhubarb.\n
Description No. 23 squadron, South East England, September 1942. \n\nOur target for tonight's mission is a German advanced warning radar installation that has miraculously managed to avoid detection so far.\nAlthough we have been aware of its existance for a few months, we have not been able to locate it... until today.\n\nA French resistance network has sent the OSS reports of suspicious German bunkers somewhere between Rouen and Beauvais. Their depiction of the camouflaged facility and the little data we've obtained on our own seem to identify the bunkers as the elusive radar installation.\n\nIt has been decided to send a pair of Mossies to sneak in at night and make a quick surprise attack to knock out the radar. \nThe bunkers are well camouflaged and will be very hard to spot in the dark. The French resistance will therefore light a beacon as close to the radar antenna as they can get to help us home in on our target. \n\nIn order not to alert the enemy to our presence and avoid night fighters response, our ingress and egress altitude should not exceed 2000 ft. We won't be carrying bombs for this mission, but our four 20mm cannons should be enough to cause the antenna very serious damage and put it out of commission for a while.\n\nWe will hopefully remain undetected on our way to the target, but we will need to be very careful on the flight back, as our attack is bound to attract attention and alert the enemyy Flak gunners and Nachtjagd to our presence.\n\nPlayer skin : $$ YP-P DZ706 of 23 Sqn Malta.bmp\nMarkings off.\n\n\n
