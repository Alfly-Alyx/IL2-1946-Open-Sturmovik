Name 01 : In The Midnight Hour.
Short November 1940, Blenheim Mk.IF : Convoy Protection\n
Description No. 23 squadron, South East England, November 1940.\n\nOur mission for tonight is to protect a vital supply convoy as it enters the harbour at Dover.\n\nThe ships have been under constant attack from U-boots and Luftwaffe aircraft since it was spotted off the coast of Scotland. The RAF and Navy have done a wonderful job of protecting them, and now that night is upon us, it is our responsibility to make sure these ships reach their destination undisturbed.\n\nThe main threat is Jerry nightbombers. They usually fly terror raids against cities and industrial complexes further up North, but they will not want to miss the opportunity to hit the convoy and the Dover docks at the same time.\n\nWeather is partially cloudy, which will allow Jerry to sneak in for their attack.  Keep an eye out for anything coming from the East, and consider any contact suspicious.\n  \nPlayer skin : Blenheim_IF_Nightfighter.bmp, markings off.\n\n
