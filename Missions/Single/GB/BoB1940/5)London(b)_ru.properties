Description 5)London(b)\nWith fighter escorts\nSingle mission/online co-op(1hr)\n\nThe Luftwaffe switches to London\n7th September - 23rd October. \n\nScramble from Hawkinge Lymphne or \nManston, then Detling or Bigging hill.\n\nI've used a Spitfire MkVb, as a substitute for Mk 1b, which also had 2 x 20mm & 4 x .303's.\n\nThese missions are designed to be used with the map & map icons, to simulate radar plus radio reports tracking enemy aircraft.\nRadar, was key to the success of the UK, in the Battle of Britain. Enabling fighters from various bases, to be scrambled & guided to intercept, the incoming hostile aircraft.\n\nA big thanks to Zuti for making these missions possible.\n\n\n  AJD-NZ \n
