Description KUTTELWASCHER\n\n02 May 1942\n23.00 hrs\n\nKarel Miloslav Kuttelwascher - or Kut as he was known - was a Czechoslovak Airforce pilot who joined the RAF after escaping the Germans via Poland, France, Algeria and Morocco. Unlike the many Czechoslovak pilots flying in the four Czechoslovak squadrons, Kut, with over 2200 hours in the air, was assigned to the RAF's No. 1 Squadron, which he joined on 3rd October 1940.\n\nThe Hurricanes of No. 1 Squadron, based at Tangmere,  commenced night intruder operations on 1 April 1942 and continued until 2 July 1942 when No. 43 Squadron took over the role.\n\nPreviously, when German bombers attacked British cities, RAF fighters tackled them in our airspace. By dramatic contrast, the idea of night intrusion was to engage the Luftwaffe aircraft over their own bases in France and the Low Countries. \n\nIf the bombers could be attacked as they were coming in to land, they were particularly vulnerable, as the crews were tired and unsuspecting and the ammunition was probably used up. The runway navigation lights, combined with the slow speed of the bombers as they descended, all assisted RAF pilots in locating and destroying the enemy. \n\nIf the German bombers could be found as they were taking off, again they were vulnerable, but the crews were alert and the ammunition racks full. However, the marvellous advantage of this kind of mission, if successful, was that it destroyed not just the Luftwaffe aircraft but its bomb load, which could not then be dropped on British targets. \n\nUsually intruder activity took place during the two weeks around the full moon - known by the pilots involved as "the moon period" - since the moon assisted flying as well as location of enemy bombers. During No. 1 Squadron's three month period of night intrusion, there were four full moons: 1 April, 30 April, 30 May and 28 June. \n\nSo the night intruder operation was a specialist exercise requiring a pilot with keen eyesight, cool nerves, and the ability to seize a chance that would only last seconds. \n\nClearly it required a particular kind of aircraft and fortunately such an aircraft was to hand in the Hurricane. \n\nAt the time of its intruder operations, No. 1 Squadron was equipped with the Hawker Hurricane IIC. This mark entered service in the late spring of 1941 and, of all Hurricane versions, it was the one built in greatest numbers. This Hurricane was powered by a Rolls Royce Merlin XX engine and it had a maximum speed of about 330 miles per hour. \n\nThe IIC was fitted with four 20 mm Hispano cannon, two in either wing, in place of the 8 or 12 Browning machine guns on earlier marks, so there was much more power in the punch. However, each of the four cannon had only 91 rounds which was merely enough for about nine seconds firing. So every second had to count and, in Kut's case, it most certainly did. \n\nThe intruder Hurricanes did not have the normal green and grey camouflage scheme. Instead they were painted matt black all over in order to make it harder to detect them in the night sky. This matt finish tended to increase drag and therefore reduce top speed, but the intruder - unlike the interceptor - depended more on concealment than speed. \n\nKut's particular Hurricane had the RAF code JX:E - the designation of his aircraft since June 1941 - and the manufacturer's serial number BE 581. According to many accounts, an emblem was painted on the starboard side of the engine cowling. It depicted a scythe in yellow and across it a banner in red carrying the name "Night Reaper", a gruesome image which reflected the Czech's acute sense of vengeance. \n\n===================\n\nTONIGHT'S MISSION\n\nSaint Paul airbase near Vire has been identified as home to a Ju-88 group that has been conducting night operations in our 11 Group area. \n\nYour mission is to penetrate enemy airspace and attack enemy aircraft taking off from or landing at St. Paul.\n\nBe especially careful when crossing the coast and in the Bayeux and St.Lo areas, known flak hotspots. In addition, keep an eye out for enemy night fighters. The successes of No. 1 Squadron have led to the enemy staging night fighter patrols over Northern France.\n\n===================\nKuttelwascher's Night Reaper skin has been included in this package.\n\nAnyone wishing to know more about Karel Kuttelwascher is encouraged to read Roger Darlington's book Night Hawk:\nwww.rogerdarlington.co.uk/nighthawk.html\n\nMission and Skin by Ian Boys\n
