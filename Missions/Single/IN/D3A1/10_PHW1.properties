Name Pearl Harbor Attack, Wave 1
Short Attack American military targets on the island of Hawaii\nPlayer flies D3A1 Val\n
Description \nYou start in mid-air over the northern shore of the island of Hawaii. Your target is the American battleship row at Pearl Harbor. You will fly due south with a large group of planes tasked with destruction of various targets on the island. \n\nAt the point near the eastern tip of the island marked on your map the group will sub-divide into smaller flights. Your flight will along the western mountain range and then do a wide S-turn onto the Pearl Harbor to give our fighters the time to gain and maintain control over the Pearl Harbor airspace. Your target is located right in the middle of Pearl Harbor, which should be hard to miss with all the American ships moored right next to each other.\n\nYour primary goal is destruction of enemy aircraft carriers. If all are already sunk by the time you are over the target, the second priority is American battleships. \n\nGood luck today. This should be glorious day in the history of Japan, with a military victory even greater than Tsushima in 1905.\n\n
