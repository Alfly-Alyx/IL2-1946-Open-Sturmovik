Name Tulagi Patrol
Short Patrol airspace over Tulagi, Gavutu and Florida islands\nPlayer flies A6M2-N Zero\n
Description \nYou start in mid-air over the Savo island at the south-eastern end of the Solomon Islands. Island of Tulagi is due East.\n\nAs I'm sure you're well aware, there has been an increased number of enemy sightings in the Guadalcanal area in the past few days. We are increasing the number of air patrols over the area. Your flight is to patrol the airspace to the South of Florida islands, especially the island of Tulagi.\n\nEnemy aircraft, if you encounter any, will likely be F4F Wildcats and SBD Dauntlesses. Bombers are of course your primary target. Your excellent aircraft completely outclass the obsolete American Wildcats, and American pilots turn green with fear at the mere sight of a Zero, so don't mind the fighters that much and just concentrate on the escorts.\n\nGood luck!\n\n
