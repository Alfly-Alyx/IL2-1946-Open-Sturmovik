Description \nPatrol over Kyushu\n\nDate: 11th of May, 1945\nTime: 16:45\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Ashiya\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nAll the newspapers and radio yesterday were filled with the news of our ally's surrender. Russia and the Western Allies accepted the unconditional surrender of Germany two days ago, and now Japan was facing them all alone. This was no reason to despair, however. We were still strong, and we could still show the enemy a thing or two. If they ever decide to assault the home islands themselves, they won't find it nearly as easy as they drive down the Western Europe. Thousands of our planes are hidden all over the islands, each ready to take to the air and then plummet down onto the enemy.\n\nSeveral elite kokutais, equipped with the latest aircraft, continue to fight bravely in the skies over the home islands. Ours, flying the best fighter in the sky, the N1K2-J, continues to defend the airspace over Southern Kyushu. \n\nWe were ordered to take-off at 16:45 and patrol the airspace over the industrial targets along the North-Western coast.\n\nYour Objective: patrol the coast.\n\nYour Flight: 8 N1K2-Ja.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 16:45 \u0432 \u044E\u0433\u043E-heading West. The flight route is marked on your maps. After take-off climb to 4 - 4,5 thousand meters. If you locate enemy planes, intercept them and prevent them from attacking their targets.\n\n
