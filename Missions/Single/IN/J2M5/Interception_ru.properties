Description \nRays of the Setting Sun\n\nDate: 23rd of April, 1945\nTime: 17:45\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Chiran\n\nThe island of Okinawa is engulfed in flames. Fighting of incredible intensity rages on between our defenders and the enemy marines. Our units are performing acts of incredible bravery holding off the enemy advance, and the General Staff is attempting to relieve the situation by employing special attack units against enemy warships. Tokkotai pilots take off from Southern Kyushu and head South, where they independently search for enemy ships and attack them. These operations, so far, were met with a great deal of success.  \nUnderstandably, the enemy is very worried about this new kind of warfare. As they are apparently aware where the suicide flights originate from, the number of B-29s seen over Southern Kyushu has greatly increased. These lumbering giants are aiming to destroy our tokkotai bases. \n\nMission Briefing:\n\n352nd Kokutai, equipped with the new J2M5 fighters, is given the task of defending the southern Kyushu from B-29 raids. \n\nAt 17:30 today early warning radar stations located a large enemy formation, heading towards our base. The formation is expected to be a group of B-29s escorted by P-51 Mustangs.\n\nAir Group HQ ordered two flights of J2M5 to take-off and intercept the bombers before they can unload their deadly cargo on our location. Six Army Ki-100 fighters have already been scrambled, and are en route to target. They will deal with the escort fighters. \n\nYour Objective: intercept the B-29s.\n\nYour Flight: 8 x J2M5.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake-off at 17:45 heading South-West. The flight route is marked on your maps. After take-off climb to 6,400 meters. The flight route should put you straight ahead of the formation, allowing for an initial head-on pass. Try to aim a full salvo at the bomber's glass cockpit. After the attack, do not repeat the mistake of many young pilots and climb straight up. This would make you a perfect target for all the defensive guns in the vicinity. Instead, you can dive and then split-S, executing a second firing pass from below; or chandelle to the side, and perform a series of attacks on the bomber beam from alternating directions.\n\n
