Name Pearl Harbor Attack, Wave 1
Short Attack American military targets on the island of Hawaii\nPlayer flies A6M2-21 Zero\n
Description \nYou start in mid-air just ahead of the northern shore of the island of Hawaii. Your target is an American airbase called Hickam Field. You will fly due south with a large group of planes tasked with destruction of various targets on the island. \n\nAt the several kilometers into the island marked your map the group will begin to sub-divide into smaller flights. Your flight will continue down the valley between two mountain ranges. Your target, Hickam Field, is located just West of Pearl Harbor. It should be hard to miss with all the American ships burning and sinking from attacks of our other planes.\n\nYour primary goal is keep enemy planes on the ground and the airspace clear for our dive bombers which should be attacking the field momentarily. After the dive bombers finish their job you can feel free to drop down and add some of your cannon shells to the smoldering stew below.\n\nGood luck today. This should be glorious day in the history of Japan, with a military victory even greater than Tsushima in 1905.\n\n
