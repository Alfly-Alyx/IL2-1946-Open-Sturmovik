Name Pearl Harbor Attack, Wave 2
Short Attack American military targets on the island of Hawaii\nPlayer flies A6M2-21 Zero\n
Description \nYou start in mid-air to the East of the northern tip of the island of Hawaii. Your target is the American battleship row at Pearl Harbor. You will fly due south with a large group of planes tasked with destruction of various targets on the island. \n\nAt the point near the Eastern shoreline of the island marked on your map the group will sub-divide into smaller flights. Your flight will continue due South-South-West at 3,000 meters of altitude. Your target is located right in the middle of Pearl Harbor, which should be hard to miss with all the American ships moored right next to each other.\n\nThe first wave reported that American aircraft carriers are not at Pearl Harbor. You are to double-check this information. If the carriers are indeed not found, attack American battleships that still remain afloat. \n\nGood luck today. This should be glorious day in the history of Japan, with a military victory even greater than Tsushima in 1905.\n\n
