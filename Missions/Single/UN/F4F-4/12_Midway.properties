Short Escort our bombers as they search for Japanese carriers.\nF4F-4 Wildcat\n
Description \nYou start in mid-air over the Pacific ocean. Below you are our SBD bombers which are attempting to locate the Japanese carriers which have been spotted in this area earlier today.\n\nIf they manage to find the carriers you are sure to be met with multiple flights of Japanese fighters screening their carriers. Be alert, as these flights will usually be stacked in altitude. If you see Japanese fighters below you, don't forget to check the skies above you. There may be more Japanese fighters there diving on you!\n\nDo not enter dogfights. Scare the fighters away, and stick to the bombers like glue. You must do everything you possibly can to help them place some bombs on Japanese carrier decks!\n\n
