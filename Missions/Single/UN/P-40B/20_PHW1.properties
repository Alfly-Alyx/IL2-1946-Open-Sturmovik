Name Pearl Harbor Defense 2
Short Air raid Pearl Harbor\nTHIS IS NOT A DRILL\nBellows Field\nPlayer flies P-40B\n
Description \nDate: December 7, 1941\nTime: 08:55\n\nThe whole island of Oahu is swarming with Japanese aircraft! Battleships at Pearl Harbor are burning, and many major airfields have been hit at least once. \nHowever the air appears to be relatively clean over Bellows. Three P-40s are ready for action. Take-off, locate and destroy any Japanese aircraft you see. Aircraft that may still be en route to their targets are your highest priority.\nGood luck!\n\n
