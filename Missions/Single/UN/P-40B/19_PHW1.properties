Name Pearl Harbor Defense 1
Short Air raid Pearl Harbor\nTHIS IS NOT A DRILL\nHaleiwa Field\nPlayer flies P-40B\n
Description \nDate: December 7, 1941\nTime: 08:15\n\nYou've just drove to Haleiwa field from Wheeler, being strafed by Japanese aircraft in the process! P-40s are all ready for you sir, fully fueled and armed. \nTake off immediately, climb to sufficient altitude, and attempt to do something to stop this attack. There are hordes of Japanese aircraft in the air, so watch out for enemy fighters at all times.\nWe've just received word of 12 dive-bombers attacking the Marine Base at Ewa. They may be a good target. Alternatively you may fly to Pearl Harbor and attempt to defend our fleet that's been under continious attack for the past hour.\nGood luck, and may God be with you!\n\n
