Name Carrier Landing 2
Short Static Carrier Landing Training Mission\nPlease see the Carrier Landing - Allied mission in the Training Section\nNote: the carrier is stationary during this mission\n
Description Static Carrier Landing Training Mission\nPlease see the Carrier Landing - Allied mission in the Training Section\n\nNote: unlike the previous carrier training mission, in this one your carrier is not moving. This makes landing more difficult as you no longer have the added benefit of carrier's speed added to your own. You have to come in at an even slower airspeed, and have even less room for error. Good luck!\n
