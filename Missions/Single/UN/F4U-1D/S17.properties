Name Carrier Take-Off 2
Short Static Carrier Take-Off Training Mission\nPlease see the Allied Carrier Take-Off mission in the Training Section\nNote: the carrier is stationary during this mission\n
Description Static Carrier Take-Off Training Mission\nPlease see the Allied Carrier Take-Off mission in the Training Section\n\nNote: unlike the previous carrier take-off training mission, in this one your carrier is standing still. This makes your take-off much more difficult as you no longer have the added benefit of carrier's speed added to your own. You have to make sure that your engine is at max RPM before you begin moving, and even then success is not guaranteed. Good luck!\n
