Name Boost For Morale
Short Protect three vunrable bombers\n
Description Gentleman you have proberly heard this allready, but during the night the Russians were able to make a push and took p-ov Sredniy and p-ov Rybachiy, forcing our ground forces onto the mainland.  This is a loss but the most worrying thing of all is the airfield at Pummanki was over-run and we believe the Russians will make it operational for their planes.\n\nMorale is at an all time low among our ground and air force. We need to do something to give them all hope. Three small bi-plane bombers have been organised for a small raid on the airfield. We won't be able to stop them from using it completlly, but we will be able to harrass them enough so it delays their work for a few hours, and even this will give our fighting forces a morale boost.\n\nThe planes are to target any re-suply planes that are there, your job will be to escort the bombers. The Russians will be bound to have planes up defending the airfield and your job is to keep them off of the bombers. The bombers know what job they have to do, so don't worry about them, just make sure their rear-ends are clear.\n\nTake off will be at 08:00.\n\nGood luck everyong and remember why you are doing this. For our fighting force. Good luck!\n
