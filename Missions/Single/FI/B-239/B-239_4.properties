Short MOMENT OF TRUTH\n
Description \n21st April 1943\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nLentolaivue 24, once the best Finnish fighter unit, has fallen on hard times. Combat and accident losses have reduced us from 4 flights of Brewsters to 3 and pride of place now goes to LeLv 34 with its new Messerschmitt 109G2s. Indeed the new unit has been able to pick the best pilots from the other squadrons and we have lost many of our best men.\n\nImproved Russian training and equipment means that we are starting to take casualties and can no longer rely on being able to dive away from trouble. Russian planes now escort from above and can fly up to 100 km/h quicker than us.\n\nNevertheless, we still have an important job to do protecting our shipping in the Gulf of Finland and the important port at Kotka. Our base in Suulajarvi near the front line means that we see combat more often than any other unit.\n\n\nMISSION:\n\nTime: 08.00\nWeather: Clear\n\nA Flight of IL-2s, escorted by Yaks, has just attacked one of our ships south of Kotka. They are returning to Oranienbaum. We will intercept them en route. Hitting the Sturmoviks is the first priority, as it will make the Russians wary of attacks on our shipping.\n\nYou will command a flight from 3/LeLv 24. The rest of the squadron is on stand-by to see how the fight develops. Get airborne and catch the intruders.\n\n
