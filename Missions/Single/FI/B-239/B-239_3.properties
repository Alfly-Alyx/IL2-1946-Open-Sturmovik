Name B-239 N3
Short OPEN SEA\n
Description \n22nd November 1942\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThe Soviet Baltic Sea Airforce (KBF) is getting increasingly confident now that it is starting to acquire more modern fighters. Luckily our forward observation point at Ino can see Russian aircraft taking off and landing at Kronstadt and Oranienbaum and we can choose and time our fights better: there have even been a number of recent successes against planes returning from attacks on German forces in Estonia low on fuel and ammunition.\n\nWith the onset of winter Soviet submarines are withdrawing to Kronstadt and the Baltic Sea Airforce is increasing their aerial fighter screen.  We must show them who the Gulf of Finland belongs to. Our squadron, LeLv 24 has been moved up to the front line at Suulajarvi to provide quicker response to Soviet fighter and bomber activity - it is the first time the squadron has been together since the war began.\n\n\nMISSION:\n\nTime: 09.00\nWeather: Hazy, Clouds at 800m\n\nRussian fighters and ground attack aircraft were spotted taking off from Kronstadt some 20 minutes ago. Sweep the area to the west of Kotlin Island and see if you can surprise them. The weather is not ideal, with low level visibility especially poor.\n\nYou will be leading a flight of six Brewster Model 239s from 4/LeLv 24. This is likely to be the last big fight of the year as heavy snowstorms are expected tonight. Make sure we end the year well.\n\n
