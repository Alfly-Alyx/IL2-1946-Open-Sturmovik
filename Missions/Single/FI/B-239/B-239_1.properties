Name B-239 N1
Short DAY ONE OF THE CONTINUATION WAR\n
Description \n25th June 1941\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThree days after Operation Barbarossa it looks as though Finland is being thrust back into the war with reports of Russian bombers over our towns and southern bases, where some German aircraft have been based. \n\nOur squadron leader, Major Magnusson, has moved our flight, 2/LLv 24, to Selanpaa, an airbase near the Finnish south coast, to defend Finnish airspace in case of attack. Our Brewsters were painted in camouflage colours only six days ago and it is time for their first combat mission.\n\n\nMISSION:\n\nTime: 07.10\nWeather: Clear\n\nRussian bombers were spotted approaching our coast at 0640 hours and at 0700 we received news that Inkeroinen is being bombed by a large formation. \n\nCapt. Ahola, our flight commander has ordered two Brewsters to head towards Inkeroinen, catch the enemy and destroy as many as you can. This will be the first aerial engagement of a new war .\n\n
