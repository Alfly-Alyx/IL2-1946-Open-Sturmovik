Name Luftwaffe Pilot_Battle of Britain5
Short Attack returning RAF Bombers\n
Description Late July, 1940\nJG2 "Richthofen" I.e Gruppe\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nAchtung Fliegeren!\nSorry to spoil your little swimming party this afternoon but command has just informed me that several flights of RAF bombers are headed this way. They are returning to their bases after attacking port facilities. Those cheeky bastards -  attacking ports is the Luftwaffe's job! Remind them that the Luftwaffe controls the skies of France!\nSpotters estimate them to be at around 3,000m so you'll have to climb hard to reach them. \n\nNo heroics -  don't wait to see flames or wings coming off them. It's a long flight home across the Channel with damaged engines and shot-up crew members. \nAgain, check your ditching equipment - life-vest, dinghy, flares - and should you be forced to ditch at sea, radio in and head for the areas marked on your flight maps. \n\nJedermann - you, Schalk and Meissner are on this one. Do us proud! We can't let old Wick get all the glory in this battle!\n\nGood hunting!\nDismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
