Short Protect a Ju-52 from the RAF savages.\n
Description Late July, 1940\nOff the coast of England\n\nJedermann, \nWe have a problem that needs immediate action. One of our Ju-52 ambulances has been making flights over the southern coast of England recently, just to identify possible rescue locations, of course. Nothing untoward going on at all. \nUnfortunately the cynical RAF are rather less charitable in their estimations of its purpose. They are convinced it is conducting reconnaissance under cover of its red cross markings and have been making efforts to down it. Naturally we cannot allow this kind of bullying and brutality to continue. You and Schalk are to make sure the medical evacuation flight returns safe and sound. These men have saved dozens of pilots lives already so we owe them a great deal. Hurry though - the crew have already called in fighter sightings!\n\nHorrido!! \n\n***AIRSTART***\n\n
