Short Escort bombers on their way to attack an aircraft factory.\n
Description Mid August, 1940\nNear the English coast\n\n "3.e Staffel. Hier ist Jedermann. Stay with the bombers! They have been taking a fearful beating and their morale is shaky, poor bastards. Your task is to fend off  the RAF and let the bombers do their job. Don't get dragged away into dogfights with the British. Hit them hard in one pass then rejoin the bomber stream. We are not in this to rack up victories but rather to keep good men alive. Moltz! Tebbe! - welcome to the Deep End. Things are going to get hectic so stick close and try not to mess up those shiny new planes you're in!! Keep your eyes open for friendlies - JG27 are with us, remember.\nWelcome to the show, boys!\nJedermann, out."\n\n\n***AIRSTART***\n\n\n
