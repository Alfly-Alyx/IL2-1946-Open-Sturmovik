Short Escort JU87's as they attack the port of Weymouth.\n
Description Early July, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I.e Gruppe\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nWilkommen, Willi. \n\nGlad to have you back with us! I hope you left Berlin in the same state as you found it? You did give my regards to Lulu at the Cat Parlour for me when you were back home on leave, I hope? I'm sure a dashing  young Luftwaffe pilot, a veteran of  the Kondor Legion, no less, could cut quite a swathe through Berlin's female population. Just as long as you left some for the rest of us! \n\nAnyway, welcome back - you've arrived just in time. Things are hotting up on this new "Kanal Front". As you probably know, a couple of days ago Goering announced our new directive - "der Kanalkampf "(the Battle of the Channel). Fliegerkorps II and VIII have been tasked with closing the Channel to British shipping and gaining a free hand in the skies above the Channel to either force a British capitulation or to aid in a planned seaborne invasion. \n\nWell, what could be simpler, eh? It'll be the work of a moment.  I can see from your expression that you are thrilled to be back in the thick of things so let's go take a gander at the plan of attack.\n\nYesterday Do17's and Ju88's flew reconnaissance missions over the British ports and today we'll be following up on that information.\n\nThis morning's mission is aimed at denying the Tommies use of the Channel by destroying their port facilities.  You will escort  Ju87s of StG 77 on their mission to bomb British shipping in Weymouth. \n\nTake off at 0728 and link up with the Stuka's over the Channel. Climb full out, around 350km/h. You know how these things are - there's always a foul-up somewhere along the line so be prepared to circle if they don't show up on time. The rendezvous location is marked on your flightmap.Cruising altitude is 4,000m. Stay above and behind the Stuka's - you will have to weave about a bit to do this. You can expect some resistance in the form of flak and fighters but the Britischers won't be expecting us so it shouldn't be too heavy.\n\nTo be on the safe side, go over your emergency ditching procedures with the new boys in your Schwarm, especially Schalk and Bergmann - this will be their first combat sortie. Keen lads, undoubtedly but a bit green around the edges. Keep an eye on them, won't you? Especially that Schalk boy. He's something of a tearaway - might even be a challenge to your reputation as Staffel good-time boy! \n\nRemember that there will be rescue birds in the area as well as some E-boats to help pick up any downed airmen. The pre-selected ditching zones are marked on your flight maps. If you absolutely have to go down, do it here or you'll end up a P.O.W. or dead. Check you have flares, a life vest and an inflatable dinghy. Even with them, the Channel is no place to be so keep a close eye on your fuel gauge - you won't have much time to tango with the Spitfires and Hurricanes. So dive from the sun, attack, and get out of there!\n\nGood hunting!\nDismissed!\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nPaintscheme (unless indicated): BoF_standard_3.bmp Markings OFF\n\n
