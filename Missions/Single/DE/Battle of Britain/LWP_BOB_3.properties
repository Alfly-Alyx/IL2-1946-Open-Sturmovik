Short Escort Stuka's attacking a British convoy.\n
Description Early July, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I.e Gruppe airfield,\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nGuten Tag Fliegeren. Kommandant Fink's precious "Freya" system has  detected a convoy making a run into port under the cover of cloud and morning mist. St.G 1.e have been dispatched to make sure they are stopped. We shall deny the Tommies even the use of their own sea lanes. Their continued defiance will merely ensure they are left to wither on the vine until all their fight is snuffed out. Once this is done, our land forces can stroll ashore and add one more territory to the Reich.\n\n Goering assures us that the complete destruction of the RAF as an effective fighting \nforce is just days away so don't expect much in the way of enemy air activity today.  \nNow I just hope that someone has conveyed Herr Goering's message to the verdammt Spitfire and Hurricane pilots!\n\nYour task this morning is to escort the Stukas to and from the targeted convoy. \nRecent actions have shown up some major deficiencies in the Stuka when pitted against a modern airforce. Nevertheless, as aerial artillery they are strikingly effective so do your best to let them get their jobs done properly.\nAs usual, climb  hard and rendezvous just out to sea. The Stukas will be at  4000m so fly top cover at around 6000m in order  to get the jump on any possible attackers.\nOh, and Jedermann, look out for Schalk, will you? One kill under his belt and the boy thinks he's an ace like good old Wick! Just make sure he stays out of trouble. \n\nDismissed.\n\n***AIRSTART***\n\n\n
