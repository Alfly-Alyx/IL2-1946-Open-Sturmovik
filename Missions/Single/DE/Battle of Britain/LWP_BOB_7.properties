Short Freijagd over Weymouth\n
Description Late July, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I.e Gruppe\nBeaumont-le-Roger\n\nAchtung, Fliegeren.\nFirst of all,  I have some bad news about young Bergmann. As you have all probably heard, he ground-looped his Emil while trying to take off on a test flight this morning. I regret to inform you that he was killed in the process. He was a fine young man and he died doing a man's duty. We will be having a whip around after this mission for his young widow.  She'll need anything you can spare. Jedermann. You'll be cleaning out his kit so make sure that nothing upsetting gets back to her. He died a hero. \n\nOur men are doing their best to remove the wreckage from the runway but it would pay to keep an eye out.\n\nFor the rest of us, however, there is a war to fight. This afternoon we are going up on a search and destroy mission - a Frei Jagd. We haven't made a big enough dent in enemy fighter numbers and Goering is kicking up a shitstorm further up the chain which means that we're going over the ditch to drag the RAF up into the skies where they can be slaughtered. \n\nThe plan is simple. 3.e Staffel, led by you, Jedermann, will link up over the French coast with some elements from our neighbours, JG 26. You'll be able to spot them easily enough by the ridiculous yellow noses on their 109's.  Admittedly our experiments with a less visible paintscheme aren't a great deal more elegant but nevertheless, bright yellow?! They say it improves situational awareness in a dogfight and I'm inclined to agree - the enemy can spot you much more easily! You'll never see JG2 in those clown outfits!  \n\nTake off at 1123 and climb to 4000m. Due to Bergmann's accident this morning your takeoff may be slightly delayed. Our ground crews are working at full speed but you will need to climb hard if you are to make the rendezvous. Once you have linked up with the other flights, turn for England and climb to 5000m . Head to the airfields of St. Eval and Exeter. If there is no resistance, move on to Tangmere. Let's see how many Tommies come to the party. But keep an eye on those fuel guages and if you take any damage radio in and head straight back. We do not wish to lose too many more pilots and machines. \nThe RAF are giving us more of a fight than OKL expected. Not to worry though. \nWe've been through Spain, Poland and France - this puny little islet isn't going to stand in our way for long!\nAnd remember - let's bag a few Britischers for  Bergmann and all the others who never came back.\n\nMan your aircraft. To the hunt! Horrido!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nPaintscheme: BoF_standard_5\n\n\n
