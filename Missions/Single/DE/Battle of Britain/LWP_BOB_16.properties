Short Escort He111s over London. Watch your fuel if you get hit! It's a long lonely flight home.\n
Description August 1940\nThe skies of London\n\nFrom this morning's briefing...\n\nThis is the big one, boys! Target for today - London!\n\nToday our He-111s are making for the docks of London. This is a prime target both for military and propaganda purposes. Any materiel destroyed at the docks will make our imminent invasion easier. Already you will have noticed our troops massing in the ports. If we can knock out their dockyards and facilities right in the heart of the Britischers capital we will assist them and give the RAF a real black eye at the same time.\n\nAllowing the bombers safe passage here could also have a major effect on the morale of the Londoners. For this reason we will do our utmost to ensure the Heinkels have a free hand in their bombing duties...\n----------------------------------\nThe skies above London...\n\n\n"Hier is Jedermann. Release drop tanks. That's it lads. We're a long way from home today and we're cutting it fine for fuel so any hits to your plane, turn tail and go flat out for France. Limit your attacks to single passes. You'll never make it home if you stay to tango. Jedermann out."\n\nShortly after...\n\n"Achtung! Achtung!! Indianer um 12 Uhr!  Lieber Gott! I have never seen so many Britischers in one place!Keep them off the bombers! Second flight stay with the bombers. First flight -come with me. We'll have to take them out ship to ship.  This is it, boys! "\n\n*****\nAIRSTART\nAltitude 7000m\nSpeed 350km/h\n\n\n\n\n***\n\nNOTE: Older machines may want to lower graphic settings to excellent for the start of this mission.\n\n\n
