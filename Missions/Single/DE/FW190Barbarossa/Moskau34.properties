Description Date: 11.10.1941\n\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: clear\n\n\nOberkommando is planning a large-scale offensive to take over the city of Moscow. There have been a lot of troop-movements in the last days. The front line has become static and it seems that both sides need a break to relax.\n\nToday we will fly along the front line. Keep your eyes open - the enemy seems to have plenty of new aircraft up in the air again. Fortunately, we also have more planes that are ready for action. Good hunting!\n\n\n
