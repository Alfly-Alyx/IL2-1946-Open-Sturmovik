Description \nDate: 01.06.1944\n\nTime: 07:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nWelcome back to action on the eastern front!\nIt seems that no-one can stop the Soviets now. Their flow of troops and supplies is endless.\nFor us, supplies are getting shorter and shorter. The Russians are far superior in numbers and we cannot do anything about it. The Crimea, one of the last of our outposts in the east, will be evacuated in the next few days.\n\nYour Staffel will provide cover for this operation. On the island, there is the 17th Armee led by Generaloberst Jaenicke and some Rumanian divisions, which are completely isolated since 1st of November last year. Re-supplying can only be done by ship.\nThe evacuation will start under the command of Admiral Schwarzes Meer, Vizeadmiral Brinkmann and the Seekommandant Krim, Konteradmiral Schulz. The 17th Armee will be brought to Rumania.\n\nFly CAP (combat air patrol) today in your new territory with your new Fw190A-8 from Berlin. Dismissed!\n\n\n\n
