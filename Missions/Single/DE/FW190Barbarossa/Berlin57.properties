Description Date: 03.03.1942    \n\nTime: 10:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: clear\n\nLocation: Berlin/Potsdam Gatow Airport\n\n\n\nWelcome to Berlin! We have a special mission for you. You are going to test fly a new fighter-aircraft for the Fockerwulfwerke. The F\u00FChrer, the Reichsmarschall and Willi Messerschmitt himself want to see how this bird performs in the hands of an expert.\n\nThe plane is called Fw190 and there are some very interesting features compared with your F-Type. It can carry a drop tank and four Guns with 20-mm-cannons which are in the wings. In addition, it can carry four 50kg bombs, one 250kg bomb or one 500kg bomb.\n\nIt goes without saying that the Fw190 is faster.\n\nToday you will fly around Berlin to get yourself familiar with the new fighter. Don\u00B4t forget the drop tank.\n\nTomorrow the show will start, good flying! Dismissed.\n\n
