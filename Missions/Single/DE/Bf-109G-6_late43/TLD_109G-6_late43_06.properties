Short Protecting supplies *1944\n
Description Date: April 1,1944\nTime: 5:45\nWeather: Clear\nClouds at 900 m\n\nGentlemen,\n\nOur destination for today will be Yalta. Recon has spotted a flight of Soviet Ilyushin ground attack aircraft heading that way.\n\nWe assume they are heading for our supply columns in the area.\n\nIts your job to make sure they won't reach their target.\nThe day is short so when you arrive you will most likely meet the enemy instantly. Go for the Ilyushins and leave the fighters for what they are.\n\nAfter you have destroyed the bombers you can have a run for the fighters.\n\nGood luck, and have a safe return.\n
