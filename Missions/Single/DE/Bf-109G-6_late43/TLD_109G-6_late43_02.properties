Short Trainbusting *1945\n
Description Date : March 23th 1945\nTime : 15:26\nWeather : good\nClouds : 1400\n\nGentlemen,  today we will pay a little visit to the red piggies in the Swebodzyn area. I hope you have a map of it. If you don't please report at my office before flight and I'll get you one.\n\nYou should probably have seen the ground crew mounting bomb ordance under the aircraft and so you will most likley know what you will be doing the next following hour.\n\nLets get to business. The Russian war machine is greatly dependendend on trains and so it is vital for them to keep them aswell for us to destroy them if we want to delay the Russians in transporting their airms to the front.\n\nYour plane is equipped with one SC 250 bomb. And I guess that should be more than sufficient.\n\nGood luck.\n\n\nGood luck\n
