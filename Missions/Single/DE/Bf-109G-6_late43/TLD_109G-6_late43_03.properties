Short Backing retreat *1945\n
Description Date : April 27th 1945\nTime : 16:00\nWeather : Hazy\nClouds : 1000M\n\nGentlemen,  we are building up massive concentrations of vehicles allong all bridges ready to cross it.\n\nIt is obvious that this is a nice target to enemy bombers. \n\nOur fighters just returned from a scramble to intercept enemy IL2 bombers above the Bad Freienwalde area.\n\nBut we assume that the enemy will do another attempt soon.\n\nYou are ordered to patroll the area and keep off any enemy bomber you see.\n\nGood luck\n
