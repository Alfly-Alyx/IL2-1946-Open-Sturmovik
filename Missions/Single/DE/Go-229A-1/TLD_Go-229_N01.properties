Short Caen Airfield takedown (LUFT46)\n
Description May 10th 1946\n\nWe have made it through the winter and are now back as where we where two years a go. But we shouldn't cheer to early. First we should continue our push until we have reestablished our borders of 1942 or agreed with a peace agreement with the Allies.\n\nUntil then it remains a bitter fighting. \n\nToday we will undertake a raid against the Caen airfield wich is being used against us as a bomber allocation.\n\nYour task is to escort the He-111 bombers and defend it against the Y80 jet fighters.\n\nNote that when you go on the pursue or do anything low near the airfield the, except the flying route , sky is filled with barrage balloons. \n\nGood luck.\n\n\n
