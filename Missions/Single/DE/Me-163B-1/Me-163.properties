Short ROCKET POWER\n
Description ROCKET POWER\n\n23rd November 1944\n\nToday has dawned bright and clear  bomber weather. Fighter Control reports an American pathfinder force in advance of the main bombing fleet. They are expected to pass just north of your base in less than 10 minutes. Disrupting them will have an effect on the whole American bombing effort today.\n\nFive minutes after you take off we will send up a flight of Messerschmitt fighters who will patrol over the base for twenty minutes to cover your landing. You can expect the American heavies to be covered by escort fighters no problem while you have fuel but very dangerous on your glide back down. Be careful.\n
