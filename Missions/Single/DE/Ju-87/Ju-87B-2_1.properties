Description \nDate: 23rd September 1941\nTime: 09.30\nWeather: Clear\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nOn the 16th September heavy Soviet warships bombarding German troops came under attack by 30 Stukas led by Hpt. Steen of StG 2. The Russian battleship, the Marat, was hit by at least one 500kg bomb has had to put into Kronstadt Naval Base for repairs.\n\nOur medium bombers raided Kronstadt on the 19th but, apart from damaging a destroyer, reported no hits. However they did report a very intense barrage of heavy anti-aircraft fire.\n\nThe Marat is still firing from Kronstadt harbour itself, her huge 30.5 cm guns wreaking havoc on our front-line and preventing further advances along the coast towards Leningrad.\n\n\nMISSION:\n\nStukageschwader 2 Immelmann has been tasked with sinking the Marat in Kronstadt harbour. \n\nThe first Stuka wave has been met by intense anti-aircraft fire that darkened the sky over Kotlin Island and shot down Hauptmann Steen. You are flying in the second wave of 12 Stukas from the III. Gruppe led by Oberleutnant Hans-Ulrich Rudel. \n\nYou are accompanied by Messerschmidt Bf-109F-2s of JG 54. Leave them to deal with any fighter opposition and concentrate on your job. The opposition will be intense, but its the best chance we have. Good luck.\n\n
