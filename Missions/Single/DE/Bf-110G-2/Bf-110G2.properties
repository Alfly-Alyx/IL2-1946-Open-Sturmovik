Name Bf-110G-2 N1
Short NIGHT AND DAY\n
Description NIGHT AND DAY\n\n6th November 1944\n\nBoth the Americans and Russians are now bombing Hungary and the Nightfighter units of the Luftwaffe are now constantly engaged. Flying in close cooperation with the Hungarian 101. Pumas, we are stretched to the limit every day.\n\nReports have come in of Russian bombers operating to the south-east. Your heavily-armed Bf-110s will make short work of them if you can get into firing position. However given that we can expect them to have a strong fighter escort this will be by no means certain.\n\n
