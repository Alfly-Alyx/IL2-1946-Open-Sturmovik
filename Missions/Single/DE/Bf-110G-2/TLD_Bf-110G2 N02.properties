Short Recon duty *1945\n
Description Recon duty\n\nDate : Februar 10th 1945\nTime : 15:12\nWeather : Good\nClouds : 1200M\n\nGentlemen, your duty for today will be escorting. As usual. Our intel has told us that the enemy is doing some armoured movement practice near Sz\u00E1zv\u00E1r.\n\nHowever, we don't know anything more than that. We don't know the number of tanks. We don't know what kind of tanks. And even IF there are any enemy tanks at all. So today we will send in a Focke Wulf 189 A2 UHU to take some nice pictures of the enemy exercises and find out. And at the hand of the recon work we can decide if its worth to send in some bombers.\n\nLike usual your task will be to make sure nothing will happon to the aircraft or its crew.\n\nBefore you go, Gy\u00F6nk will be near your route. Listen carefully, whatever you do stay away from Gy\u00F6nk. Make sure you won't get near. The Russians have placed a very dense concentration of flak near that town. And you will most likely not return when you WILL get near to Gy\u00F6nk.\n\nGentlremen, enjoy the flight!\n
