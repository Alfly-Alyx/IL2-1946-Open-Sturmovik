Description Date: 26.06.1942\n\n\nTime: 05:00\n\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nSorry to wake you up so early, but we've just got orders to attack a small column moving north of Gvardeyskoye to Oktyabrskoye. God, I will never get used to these names!\nNevertheless, these are partisans and we've got no infantry to deal with them, so you will take over. Now get going and you might still be back in time for breakfast!\n\n\n
