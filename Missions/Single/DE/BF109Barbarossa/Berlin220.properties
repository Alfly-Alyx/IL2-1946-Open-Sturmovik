Description Date: 16.04.1945	\n\nTime: 07:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: misty\n\n\nThe 1st Belorussian Front of Marshall Shukov and the 1st Ukrainian Front of Marshall Konjev have started their expected main attack towards Berlin.\nThey will try to take over our capital as fast as possible.\nOur ground troops fight them without fear, but the enemy outnumbers us 30 to one! It is only a question of time before the Soviets are at the gates of Berlin ...\n\nThis morning, we will start an attack against the enemy spearhead. We get support from other units, e.g. a Geschwader of Stukas. You will know by now that fuel is really short, so do not expect much assistance.\n\nTake off immediately and attack the tanks. Berlin must not fall! After the attack you will stay in the area and guard our bombers.\nGood luck boys. Dismissed.\n\n
