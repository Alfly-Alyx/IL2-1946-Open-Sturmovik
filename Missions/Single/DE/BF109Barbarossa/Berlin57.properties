Description Date: 03.03.1942    \n\nTime: 10:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: clear\n\nLocation: Berlin/Potsdam Gatow Airport\n\n\nWelcome to Berlin! We have a special mission for you. You are going to test fly a new fighter-aircraft for the Messerschmittwerke. The F\u00FChrer, the Reichsmarschall and Willi Messerschmitt himself want to see how this bird performs in the hands of an expert.\n\nThe plane is called Bf-109G-2 and there are some very interesting features compared with your F-Type. It can carry a drop tank and two pods with 20-mm-cannons which are mounted under the wings. In addition it can carry four 50kg bombs, one 250kg bomb or one 500kg bomb.\n\nIt goes without saying that the G-2 is faster and it finally has a 20mm nose-cannon.\n\nToday you will fly around Berlin to get yourself familiar with the new fighter. Don\u00B4t forget the drop tank.\n\nTomorrow the show will start, good flying! Dismissed.\n\n
