Description Date: 18.10.1941\n\nTime: 03:00 p.m.\n\n\nWeather: snow\n\nWinter arrived tonight, with snow and temperatures around minus 20 degrees. Snow keeps falling, as if we had asked for it . We have been told that winter is not that strong, even in Russia. What a grim surprise! To make it worse, our troops have got no winter equipment at all!\n\nIt is nearly impossible to get any plane airborne, so our big offensive has come to a halt.\nTry to reach the main base at Yukhnov and request winter equipment, otherwise we will be grounded until spring.\n\nDo not catch a cold out there, wegtreten!\n\n\n
