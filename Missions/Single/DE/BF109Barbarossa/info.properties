Name        Operation "Barbarossa" (Bf 109)\nDescription\n\nWelcome, Pilot! So, you volunteered to be part of the Luftwaffe? Your fatherland is grateful.\n\nIn this campaign, you will fly missions in the beginning of the so called "Unternehmen Barbarossa". The war against the USSR has begun. You have just completed flight training and you have recently arrived in Berlin. Let us hope that you become a successful fighter pilot in the German Luftwaffe!\n\nRussia is a huge country, with very special circumstances. The war will not last long, or at least we are told that will be the case. We wish you much success in fulfilling your duties.\n\nHitler\u00B4s order No. 21, 18.12.1940:\n\n"The German Wehrmacht has to be prepared to overpower Soviet Russia in a fast campaign, even before the war against England is finished. The Heer will have to utilise all available forces with the restriction that the occupied areas have to be protected from surprise attacks.\nThe Luftwaffe will have to disengage as many forces as necessary to ensure the smooth sequence of the ground operations and keep the impact of enemy air operations against the east of Germany as small as possible. The concentration of forces against Russia has to be restricted by necessity, while the German airspace and the occupied areas have to be protected from enemy air attacks and also the air attacks against England, especially its shipping lines, must continue. The main emphasis of the Kriegsmarine remains clearly the war against England.\n\nThe mass of the Red Army, which is located in the western parts of Russia, has to be destroyed by audacious operations utilising strong tank spearheads and the withdrawal of their forces into the extent of the Russian space has to be prevented. The fast advance has to reach a line where the Red Air Force is unable to reach east German air space. The final target of the operations is the shielding of asiatic Russia along a general line Wolga - Archangelsk. In that way the Luftwaffe can strike and destroy the last remaining industrial area of Russia in the Urals."\n\n\n\n                                                      \n\n
