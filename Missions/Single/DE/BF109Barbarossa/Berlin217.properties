Description Date: 09.04.1945	\n\nTime: 10:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nGuard the Me 262s that are out there starting up. They will take off shortly after you. Once you have done this, stay airborne and guard another group of Me 262s that is scheduled for landing.\n\nThese Me 262s have been quite a target lately. This is because the aircraft is very vulnerable during take-off and landing procedures. It seems to have something to do with the rather poor acceleration of this wonder bird.\n\nHowever, your help is required now, so get going!\n\n
