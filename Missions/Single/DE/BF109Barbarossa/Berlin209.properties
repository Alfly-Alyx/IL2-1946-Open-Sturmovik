Description Date: 23.03.1945	\n\nTime: 04:00 p.m.\n\nWeather: good\n\nOur attack against the Russian base at K\u00FCstrin has been repelled! Now the Soviets are advancing in great numbers across the River Oder towards Berlin!\nYou must attack the enemy tanks. You are supported by Stukas. We called for a Staffel of Focke-Wulfs D-9s to provide cover for this mission.\nThe tanks must be stopped, so that our ground units can re-group for a counter-attack.\n\nGood luck!\n\n
