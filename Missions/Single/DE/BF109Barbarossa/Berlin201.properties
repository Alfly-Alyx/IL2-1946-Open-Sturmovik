Description Date: 02.03.1945	\n\nTime: 09:00 a.m.\n\nWeather: clear\n\nWelcome back to the eastern front, we need your experience here against the Russians. The II/JG52 has been assigned to the area east of the rivers Oder and Neisse.\n\n\nThis is the situation.\n\nPanzergruppe Nehring is in the area, together with the XXXIV Panzerkorps. They will try to engage and destroy the advancing Russian troops. Unfortunately, our supplies are nearly spent, we haven't got much fuel left, let alone weapons and soldiers. The fighting gets more difficult every day, while the \nSoviets seem to have a never-ending flow of materials. The whole frontline is close to collapsing!\n\nNow it is up to every single soldier to fight the enemy with unconditional bravery!\n\nYou will fly to your newly assigned sector and scout for enemy bombers. There should be some of them around right now, heading for our capital, Berlin.\n\nGute Jagd!\n\n
