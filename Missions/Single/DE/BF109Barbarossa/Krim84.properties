Description Date: 01.07.1942\n\n\nTime: 02:00 p.m.\n\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nThe fortress of Sevastopol has been taken by the 11th Armee! Over 46,000 shells and 20,000 tons of bombs rained down on the city . Generaloberst von Manstein has been promoted to Generalfeldmarschall. The VIIIth Fliegerkorps has flown 23,751 missions. Von Manstein congratulates us and will visit our field tomorrow.\nNo time for parties, though. You will take off and fly to the coast south east of Sevastopol. The Russians have fled to the beach where they are supposed to be picked up by transport vessels. The Luftwaffe is sending all available planes to attack them. With support from the I/KG 1 you will attack the Soviet units on the beach! Rudel and his Stukas will take part, too.\nStrange. This reminds me of Dunkirk and the fleeing Tommies! \nWegtreten, get going!\n\n
