Description \nDate: 19.08.1942\n\n\nTime: 11:00 a.m.\n\n\nWeather: good\n\n\nGood to see you back again. It is getting stranger here all the time. The russians have got plenty of aircraft for some reason. We've got problems with spare parts and are lucky if we get any of our planes airborne. If only we knew how things would develop around here.\n\nThe General of the Panzertruppen, Paulus, gave orders to attack Stalingrad!\nThe 4th Panzerarmee led by Generaloberst Hoth has reached the railway tracks Stalingrad-Kalach, but they are being attacked by enemy planes all the time.\nFly to the 4th Panzerarmee and give air support. That means a Freie Jagd!\nWegtreten.\n\n
