Description Date: 14.07.1941    \n\nTime: 02:00 p.m.\n\nWeather: clear\n\nLocation: Berlin/Potsdam, Airport Gatow\n\n\nGood Work. You seem to be familliar with formation flying. Remember - stay close to your Rottenf\u00FChrer and keep  an eye on his tail. You will expect the same from your Katschmarek once you are the Rottenf\u00FChrer.\n\nWell, meine Herren, today we will practice strafing ground targets. There are some wrecked aircraft parked on the airfield, southwest of Sperenberg. You will fly to the testing range and destroy as much of these planes as possible.\n\nTonight you might get permission to go to Berlin, given that the Oberst is in a good mood.\n\nDo your best and get going!\n\n\n
