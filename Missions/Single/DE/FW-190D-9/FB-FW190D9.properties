Name        Fw-190D-9 N1
Short       THE SEELOW HEIGHTS\n
Description THE SEELOW HEIGHTS\n\n14th April 1945\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThe Red Army has been held on the Oder since February, a combination of determined resistance and the enemy's need to resupply and reform for the final push on Berlin. Our defending forces include Volkssturm from Berlin, Luftwaffe ground troops pretending to be paratroopers, battered infantry "divisions" amounting in reality to a regiment or so and a few determined armour crews. These forces are being pounded by artillery and sturmoviks in what can only be a softening up process for the big Russian push on Berlin.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTime:  10:30\nWeather: Good, scattered clouds at 1200m\n\nYou will lead a pair of Fw-190D-9 fighters from III./JG26, sent from their base west of Berlin to help stop the Russians. You will be escorting 4 Fw-190A-5 fighter-bombers of Schlachtgeschwader 4, who will be attacking a Russian rocket artillery position east of the Oder.\n\nYour mission is purely to ensure the safe return of these aircraft: the lower levels of the air battle are likely to be full of ground attack aircraft and however tempting they may be, your job is to watch out for enemy fighters threatening our Schlachtflieger. Stay at middle altitudes and protect the few remaining aircraft we have.\n
