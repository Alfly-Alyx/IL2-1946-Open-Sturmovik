Description Trial by Fire\n\nDate: 28th of July, 1946\n          1115\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Borispol\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nOKL took too long to produce new specifications for a ground attack aircraft, and as the result weve entered the new war still using the obsolete FW-190F. Now were urgently being sent potential replacements that are being tested right here at the front, and not at the testing range. \n\nYou, being an experienced attack pilot, are entrusted with four brand new D-335V-13s, prototypes of a future Do-335B. They are waiting for you at the airstrip.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nConduct a bombing strike on Soviet supply columns at the Voykovo - Gogolev highway. You will be escorted by a schwarm of Me-262HG-IIs. Soviet fighter presence in the area is estimated as light to none.\n\nYour Flight: 4 x Do-335V-13\n\nLoadout: 2 x SC 250\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake off at 1115 heading north-east. Flight route is marked on your maps.\n\n
