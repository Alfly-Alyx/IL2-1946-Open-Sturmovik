Due to the latest night attacks by the VVS on support units in Northern Poland we can only field two D-11s for todays mission, which will be an escort for Arado Strahlbomber stationed at Raseinen airfield. \n\nYou'll meet them west of the city and escort them all the way to the target and back home. \n\nMost of the VVS forces have been dispatched to counter our airborne invasion and recapture of Riga in the north of the Kurland peninsula, but stay alert.\n\nDismiss!\n
