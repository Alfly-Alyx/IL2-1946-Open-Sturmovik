Name Fw-190F-8 (Mistel) N1
Short ATTACK ON SEELOW BRIDGE\n
Description ATTACK ON SEELOW BRIDGE\n\n20th April 1945\n\nThe Russians have begun what they expect to be the final phase of their push on Berlin. After two months of preparation they finally launched their attack a few days ago. The weak point in their plan is the number of bridges they rely upon. Knocking out bridges especially affects their fuel reserves and artillery ammunition, two things the Soviets are counting on in their offensive.\n\nYour mission is to knock out a major bridge just east of the small town of Seelow. It will be the third time we have made a Mistel attack in the last 24 hours and you can expect Russian fighters in the area. You will have an escort to help deal with them, but you will have to face the flak alone. Don't get too close to the bridge before sending the bomb on its way.\n\n
