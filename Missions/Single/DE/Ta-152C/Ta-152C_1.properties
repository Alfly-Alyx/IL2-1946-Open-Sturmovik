Name Ta-152C N1
Short Ghosts of Dusk\n
Description Ghosts of Dusk\n\nDate: 14th of September, 1946\n          2040\nWeather: Clear\nLocation: Kiev-West\n\nMission Briefing:\n\nSince September \nFor the past four days the city of Kiev has been under constant bombardment by Russian artillery. At night, large formations of Tu-4 bombers come over and carpet bomb the fires. The city is slowly turning into a wasteland.\nMore than 60 new Ta-183 fighters, sent to Kiev less than a month ago, are already lost or unserviceable. Our last hope is in falling back on the piston-engine Ta-152Cs. Theyre the only thing we have that can stop the Soviet monster at night.\n\nYour Objective:\n\nTake eight Ta-152s to intercept the approaching Tu-4s. Radar shows no radar cover; you should therefore apply all your efforts to disrupting the bombing of Kiev. \n\nYour Flight: 8 Ta-152C\n\nLoadout: 2 x \u0425-4.\n\nYour Orders:\n\nTake off at 2040 heading East. Your flight route is marked on your maps. Estimated bomber altitude is 4,000 meters. Keep your airspeed as high as possible. \n\n
