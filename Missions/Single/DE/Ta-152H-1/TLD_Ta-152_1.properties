Short Kustrin flank defence, (defend the armoured formations near Kustrin from the enemy bombers.) *1945\n
Description Kustrin flank defence,\n\nFebruar 5 1945\n\nA large enemy bomber formation has been spotted earlier this day. We should take off now before it could do any damage to our armoured formations near Kustrin. Since the armoured concentration is quite dense it would be quite reccomendible for us to defend them at all costs.\n\nThe target is to keep the enemy bombers off. But destroying it is a secondairy target. The goal for today is just to defend our armour.\n\nGood luck gentlemen,\n
