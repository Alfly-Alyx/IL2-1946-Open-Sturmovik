Description Date : January 10th 1945\nTime : 6 AM\nWeather : Poor\n\nGentlemen,\n\nOur forces are in retreat again. \nThe US attack at Januar the 5th has taken its toll at our side.\n\nTo make sure the retreat will go according to plan so our forces can form another stronghold.\n\nTherefore we must be sure that the enemy fighter bombers won't destroy our tanks that are forming our rearguard.\n\nThe goal of this mission should clear now.\nDefend the ground forces and make sure no fighter bomber gets through.\n\nGood luck.\n
