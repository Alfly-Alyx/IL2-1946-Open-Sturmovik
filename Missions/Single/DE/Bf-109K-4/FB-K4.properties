Description DEFENDING THE ODER\n\n23rd February 1945\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nOn the 12th January 1945 the Red Army was still in Warsaw - by the end of the month it was on the Oder river. Our forces of the 9th Army have cobbled together a defensive line along the Oder at the Seelow Heights, facing the 1st and 2nd Belorussian Fronts.\n\nThe situation appears to have stabilised, although the poor weather and the Russian need for resupply have helped us more than our own defences.\n\nThe air situation is terrible - we are outnumbered 60:1 and we are unable to prevent the constant strafing and bombing of our defences and lines of communication. Many of our fighters are busy in East Prussia and northern Poland and most of those in Berlin are defending against the American and British bombers. Those few pilots and aircraft we have facing the Russians are mainly from the Schlachtgeschwader, now exclusively targetting bridges in an attempt to slow the Russians down for as long as possible.\n\nMISSION:\n\nTime: 06:00\n\nWeather: Rain, Clouds at 1400m, Visibilty poor under 2500m, Strong southerly wind, beware of crosswind from right at take-off.\n\nOn discharge from hospital in Berlin you have found yourself unable to reach your unit, which is trapped in East Prussia. Instead you have been told to report to pick up a fighter at Frankfurt a.d. Oder. \n\nAt the  airbase there is in chaos, old Jagdgeschwader designations meaning little as surviving units are thrown together in ad-hoc formations. The base is critically short of fuel, fresh engines and fresh pilots.\n\nDuring the last few days of poor weather the Russians have been send a weather reconnaisance aircraft towards Berlin every day at 06:00 to spot clear patches for their bombers. We have seen occasional contrails but have been unable to intercept.\n\nToday you will accompany OberLt. Greiner in a pair of Bf109K-4s to attack the intruder. Your aircraft are in poor condition - he has cooling problems and your radio only works on the airbase frequencies. \n\nAs a result you will have to follow OberLt. Greiner closely if you are to successfully intercept the enemy as he can pick up the ground controller on his radio. The waypoints on your map will not help.\n\nAt this stage in the war the preservation of pilots and machines is more important than shooting down individual Russian aircraft. As wingman it is vital that you protect OberLt. Greiner in his task.\n\nOBJECTIVE: Protect OberLt. Greiner for 35 minutes from take-off.\n
