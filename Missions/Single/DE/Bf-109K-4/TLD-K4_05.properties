Short Esort the Zerstorers ( 45 )\n
Description Date : January 5th 1945\nTime : 6 AM\nWeather : Poor\n\nGentlemen,\n\nSorry  for waking you up that early. I know you didn't have that much of sleep lately but the Amis haven given us a wake-up call again.\n\nThe phone-wires  are running  hot at the moment with requests for our services from the boys on the front, because the American forces are starting  a counter offensive as we speak.\n\nThe US 8th and 3rd Corps are trying to breech the perimeter near Bastogne. \nThey seem to be supported by the British XXX Corps.\n\nWe have been able to put up a striking force of  about ten heavily armed Zerstorers. Right now they are speeding for the combat area to provide much needed support for our boys on the ground.\n\nYour mission is simple, as usual - Defend the Zerstorers at all costs!\nMost likely, you will encounter swarms of Ami and probably British fighters.\nI\n know you will be heavily outnumbered in all probability, but we cannot provide more fighters at the moment.\n\nThe Fuhrer has promised to soon send us some reinforcements but we will have to wait just a little longer for them to arrive, as we still have not seen anything from the reinforcements, promised last November.\n\nThey simply never showed up.\n\n\nPrimary objective :\n\nDefend those Zerstorers at all costs!\nThey are the only offensive cover we can give to our hard pressed comrades on the ground!\nMake sure that they can fulfill their mission objective without much interference from enemy fighters and destroy the enemy tanks freely!\n\nHals und Beinbruch!\n\n
