Name He-111H-6 N1
Short LOW LEVEL AT KERCH\n
Description \n17th January 1942\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nBy the end of November 1941 the German 11th Army and their Rumanian allies occupied the entire Crimean Peninsula except the beleaguered port of Sevastopol. Our unit, KG100 Wiking, flying Heinkel He-111 medium bombers, was brought in to pound the Russian defences.\n\nTo our surprise the Russians have since mounted a seaborne invasion to our rear, seizing the Kerch peninsula and the harbours of Kerch and Feodosiya. This poses a threat to our troops and makes us divide our forces.\n\nThe weakness of the Russian position, however, is that all supplies have to be brought by sea or air over the Kerch Straits - as no land corridor exists between the Russian units in the east of the Crimea and the rest of the country. \n\nOur Staffel has been deployed to a forward airstrip near Feodosiya to counter this new Russian threat. We have determined that attacks on their tenuous supply lines are more effective than attacking the troops themselves.\n \n\nMISSION:\n\nTime: 0850\nWeather: Hazy, Clouds at 900m\n\nEarly this morning a Rumanian Arado-196 reconnaissance seaplane spotted freighters in Kerch harbour. You will lead a pair of Heinkel He-111H6 torpedo bombers and sink these two ships.\n\nBe aware that the Russians have standing air patrols over the Taman - Kerch sea route as well as anti-aircraft artillery. You will have to identify your targets and engage them in one pass.\n\n
