Name Aktion Hagelkorn
Description Morning Gentlemen,\n\nwe are slowly regaining terretories in Hungaria and could reestablish a fully operational base in Gy\u00F6r. \n\nYou'll be transfered there in the next hour to take part in Aktion Hagelkorn as a strike wing being equipped with PC1000RS bombs attacking a temporary repair camp. \n\nThe reconaissance reports state a great number of heavy IS-2 tanks being serviced there since last night, so these should be your main target.\n\nGood luck!\n
