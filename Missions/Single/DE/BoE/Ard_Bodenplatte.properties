Name BODENPLATTE
Short Operation Bodenplatte\n1st January 1945\n\nPlayer flies Fw-190A-8\n
Description Operation Bodenplatte\n\n1st January 1945\n0800 Hrs\n\nAs the Wacht am Rhein Offensive ("Battle of the Bulge") peters out we can expect the Allies to once more go on the attack. We desperately need time to rebuild our shattered lines.\n\nThe Luftwaffe High Command has ordered a strike on the bases of the Allied tactical fighters, their JaBos. If we can deal a harsh enough blow it will delay the expected counter-attack. We are sending over 300 of our aircraft to attack - only unserviceable fighters will remain. It's all or nothing.\n\nYour mission today is to fly in the first wave of this attack, codenamed Operation Bodenplatte. Your target is Eindhoven airbase, a heavily defended fighter-bomber station.\n\nYou will lead the second Schwarm of JG26 Focke-Wulf 190A-8s. Take a 500 kilo bomb and knock out as many enemy fighters as you can.\n\nFly low on the way to the target and we should be able to surprise the enemy.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\n\n\n
