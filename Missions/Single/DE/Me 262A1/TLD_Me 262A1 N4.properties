Short Bomber intercept *1945\n
Description Date : March 18 1945\nTime : 16.9\nWeather : Good\nClouds : 1500M\n\nGentlemen, a large incomming raid has been spotted above "Tam\u00E1si" Consisting out of plus minus 30 bombers. Possible IL4 bombers. We estimate that their target will be  "Si\u00F3fok". We are not sure if they are escorted but assume they are. If they don't its a turkey shoot.\nHowever don't count too much on it.\n\nYour task for today is just to destroy as much as possible bombers as you can and spare the lives of the Hungarian people.\n\nGood luck.\n
