Short Patrolling the Enying airspace *1945\n
Description Date : Februar 25th 1945\nTime : 13 PM\nWeather : Good\nClouds : None\n\nGentlemen, after bitter fighting we finally managed to push the Soviets back. Though the resistance is heavy and we aren't sure if we can keep it up this way.\n\nYour task for today is to patroll the airspace around Enying. Intelligence suggests that the enemy will attempt bomb the 1st SS Liebstandart armoured ellements we have located near Enying.\n\nI assume your task will be clear to you.\nDefend the ground forces at all cost!  We cannot permit any more losses.\n\nGood luck\n
