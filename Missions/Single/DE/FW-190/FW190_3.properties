The Units of the "Leibstandart Adolf Hitler" SS Division with the support of aviation have launched a full-scale assault on the positions of the Soviet 95th Guards Rifle Division, pushing through the 169th Tank Brigade and the units of the 183rd Rifle Divisions defending the front flanks of the 95th Division.\n\n\nObjective:\n\nYour goal is cover ground troops over that area.
