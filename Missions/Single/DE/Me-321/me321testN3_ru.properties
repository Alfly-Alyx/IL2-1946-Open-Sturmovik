Name Me-321 N3
Short Me-321 MOD\n\nTraining Mission #3\n\nTake Off Training with He-111Z-1 Tug\n
Description Taking Off in the 'Gigant'  is hard.  Keep your eyes open and do not select autopilot until you are ready to detach, then select autopilot again to regain control.  Remember from mission N1 that your conly controls when you are attached are rudder, elevators, and flaps (no ailerons).  When you are detached you will have full control.\n\nWhile taking off, use Autopilot to stop sliding, and/or turn engines off.  When you are airborne, disable autopilot to regain control.\n\nOnly the best of pilots are able to master this 'beast', and it is a constant strugle to keep elevators and flaps in check to adjust speed.  It is best to stay under the tug, and remember to use flaps aggressively to counter the elasticity of the cable.\n\nObjective:  Land in the destination base.  You must land in the base to complete your mission.  There will be no opposition.\n\nEnjoy.\n\ndanzigzag for AAA\n
