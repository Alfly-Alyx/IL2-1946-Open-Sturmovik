Name Me-321 N1
Short Me-321 MOD\n\nTraining Mission #1\n\nAir Start - Towed by He-111Z-1\n
Description In this mission you will fly the 'Gigant' from air start.  You cannot use Autopilot as this will separate you from the tug.  Your only controls are rudder, elevators and flaps to help you control speed (lower to decrase and raise to increase.)  (The AI does not handle ailerons while attached.)\n\nWhen you are ready to detach, press autopilot for a short time, then press it again to gain control.  Land with full flaps.  Once you land, the plane will spin, but that is because the FM was never re-written to handle this plane.  In order to reduce that or stop it, click the engine off key ('I').\n\nObjective:  Land in the viscinity of the Desert Town.  You must land in its viscinity to complete mission.  If you land in the western side of the town and destroy half of the trucks there (at least 3 of 6), you complete your secondary objectives.  (Hint:  Use your gunner positions.  When the plane starts spinning, then switch gun positions.)\n\nEnjoy.\n\ndanzigzag for AAA\n
