This morning we arrived on station off the Japanese Sakishima islands. TBM aircraft of VMTB-143 will bomb Miyara airfield on the southeast coast of Ishigaki island. You'll provide fighter escort to the island and back. Assuming you don't meet any Jap fighters you can help out by shooting up the airfield flak.
