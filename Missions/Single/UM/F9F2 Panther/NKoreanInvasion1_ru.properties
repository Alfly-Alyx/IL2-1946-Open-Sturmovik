Name Frontier Assault North Korea
Short June 6th 1951:\n\nVMF-651 Quadron led by Lt. Davidow\n\n-------------\n\nSo here it is. The North Koreans have started firong at our positions accross the border a few minutes ago with heavy artiellry. This is a clearly an invasion plan and our ground troops are being heavily pouunded.\nI fear that this is the big time, but upper commandment has ordered to disable these articllery and AAA guns to test the enemy's reactions.\nIf nothing else happens then we will not attack further.\nThey must understand that we will not tolerate any pounding of this sort and that we are ready to move them back in case they go into an all out war.\n\nYour orders:\n\nTake off immediately with your Panthers and bomb the NKoreans artiellery and AAA guns..\nSupport our ground troops. Ground troops will cross the border but only to counter attack. They will retreat as soon as the threat is over.\n\nA Neptune reconnaissance plane will fly over the battlescene and will provide intelligence..\n\nEnemy jets might pop up so watch your back.\n\nPriority Number One is bombing those artillery guns. Then you are free to engage any enemy planees but try not to go deep into enemy territory as this would worsen the situations. Try to lure them into crossing our border rather so we will have good arguments then.\n\nGood luck\n\nArmament: anything you wish but rockets should be more useful for precise targeting.\n\nTime: 8 am\n\n
