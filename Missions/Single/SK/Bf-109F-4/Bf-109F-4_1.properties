The 4th Tank Army under the command of General Colonel Hermann Hoth, accompanied by the 6th Tank Division, which had moved from France, and the 23rd Tank Division, at first surprised units of the 51st Soviet Army and forced them to retreat from the outer ring around Stalingrad. \n\nAt the same time, the 38th Tank Corps launched an offensive to secure advance movement from the left side. The Corps had struck under the command of General Karl Hollidt out of Dons curve area, but after a few days it got stuck between the Don and Donets rivers. \n\nOn December 16, units of the Soviet Southwest Front and the left wing of the Voronezh Front began a counteroffensive along a 90 km long sector, aimed against the Italian 8th Army and the left wing of the Don Group. On December 20 the Red Army broke through the front line in the direction of Rostov on Don, and as a result it cut off Army Groups Don and A from their tails. \n\nOn December 23rd, von Manstein had to retreat Northwest with the 4th Tank Army, which had managed to get close to the encirclement by a distance of 48 km. The 6th Army did not meet it halfway but retreated towards Stalingrad. In this situation, the German army was unable to take any offensive action. \n\nOn December 28, the Main Headquarters of Wehrmacht ordered retreat from the Caucasus. \n\nMission:\n\nTime: 7:05 am \nWeather: Clouds at 900 m \nVisibility: Good \n\nThe air situation in the Northern Caucasus has also gone poorly for the German Luftwaffe.
