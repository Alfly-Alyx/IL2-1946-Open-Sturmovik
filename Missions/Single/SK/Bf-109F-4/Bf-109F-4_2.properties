Description REVENGE FOR THE SLOVAK CONVOY \n\nDate: March 1, 1943 \n\nSituation: \n\nThe plan for withdrawing the German forces from the Caucasus became a reality in the beginning of 1943. Along with the retreating 1st Tank Army, the German 17th Army also began retreating to a new line. This army is retreating from one position to another under the command of Gen. Ob. Richard Ruoff.\n \nWhile the 17th Army is slowly retreating from its positions, the 4th Air Army has commanded the VIII. Air Corps to provide maximum support to the retreating units. VIII. Air Corps has attacked with all its available "Stukas". Weak fighter units provided to the VIII. Air Corps are attacking Soviet air forces as well as ground targets.\n\nDuring the night of February 3, 1943, Red Army units supported by strong artillery have attacked Novorossiysk. They have sailed the Novorossiysk Gulf with fast attack boats, and have secured a number of landing points and bridgeheads.\n\nActivity of attacking Soviet units and the Soviet air force is rapidly increasing. Soviet units are attacking and invading posts of the 17th Army daily. Soviet air forces are trying to destroy German airfields on the Kuban bridgehead.\n\nMission: \n\nTime: 3:00 pm \nWeather: Clouds at 1500 m \nVisibility: Poor\n\nBecause of the advance of the Soviet 18th and 46th Armies, Letka 13 was also forced to change its base. According to the order, the mobile part of the squadron has carried out redeployment on line Slavyanskaya - Taman - Kerch between February 17 and March 1, 1943. The flying part of the squadron and assigned ground personnel have taken this route on February 16 and 17, 1943.\n\nEvacuation from the Slavyanskaya airfield and subsequent redeployment to the new location has begun today by the 8th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, with the cover name "Sidonia".\n\nYour flight is situated 20 km west of Slavyanskaya. You have just received an urgent radio report that the retreating vehicle convoy of the Slovak 8th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment heading from Slavyanskaya to Temryuk was attacked by a group of enemy aircraft shortly after leaving the airfield area.\n\nObjective: Move quickly to Slavyanskaya and revenge the attack of enemy planes on the retreating Slovak convoy. In case Soviet airplanes are not there any more, continue in pursuit towards the east.\n\n
