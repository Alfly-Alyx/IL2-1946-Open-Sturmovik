Description DEFENSE OF BRATISLAVA\n\nDate: June 26, 1944 \n\nSituation: \n\nAir defense of Slovakia is provided by the elite Letka 13 (Emergency Squadron), located at Piestany airfield. Its members, many of them Eastern Front veterans, have completed an intensive training program, consisting mostly of quick alarm starts in flights and as a squadron. Simultaneously, all pilots were trained to fight against US heavy bomber formations.\n\nSlovak air space is under imminent threat from an incursion by the US Air Force. It is necessary to defend the important industrial suburbs of the capital Bratislava, and the ammunition factories in Povazie area.\n\nDespite increasingly intense USAF air activities over Slovakia, no direct encounters between the Allied air force and Letka 13 have occurred up to now. This is due to an unofficial order of General F. Catlos to avoid fights with American planes, and keep the Slovak planes intact for an upcoming anti-Nazi military uprising.\n\nNo contact with American bombers was made even on June 16, 1944, when the 15th USAF equipped with B-24 Liberators and B-17 Flying Fortresses escorted by P-51 Mustangs and P-38 Lightnings carried out an air raid on Bratislava. Their primary target was Apollo oil refinery in Bratislava. Civilian casualties reached 711 and 585 were injured.\n\nAfter the attack, members of Letka 13 were accused of cowardice by the National Defense Ministry and the German Military Mission. This serious accusation was announced directly to the deputy fighters commander, npor. let. Juraj Puskar. \n\nMission: \n\nTime: 9:00 am\nWeather: Clear \nVisibility: Good\n\nGerman radio broadcast Donausender has announced that a strong bomber formation is approaching the southern border of Slovakia. There are B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator heavy bombers, escorted by P-38 Lightning and P-51 Mustang fighters. One part of the formation attacks the Manfred-Weiss factory in the Hungarian city of Gy\u0151r.\n\nAxis defense forces that have taken off already to meet the attackers, consist of Bf 109 G-6s from II./JG 27 and I./JG 302, Bf 110 G-2s from II./ZG 1, Me 410s from II./ZG 76, Fw 190 A-8s from II.(Sturm)/JG 300, Bf 109 G-6s from I./JG 300 and Bf 109s from the 101. fighter squadron of the Hungarian Royal Air Force.\n\nAfter evaluation of the situation and information that enemy planes are approaching Bratislava air space, por. let. Ludovit Simon ordered eight Bf 109s of Letka 13 to take-off immediately.\n\nEight "Gustavs" are commanded by npor. let. Juraj Puskar, an experienced Eastern Front fighter pilot, who is very unhappy bearing the accusation of cowardliness. This time he has decided to act. His plan is as follows: The flight will gain a height advantage, release the drop tanks over the bombers formation, dive on them, attack quickly and escape immediately afterwards to avoid the escort fighters. Pilots may use any Hungarian airfield for landing.\n\nObjective: Attack the heavy bombers nearing the southern border of Slovakia.\n\n
