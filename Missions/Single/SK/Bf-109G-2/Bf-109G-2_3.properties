It was the last German offensive on the Eastern Front.\n\nThe plan called for an attack on the Soviet bridgehead on the Kursk Front by simultaneous attacks carried out by the strong Army Group Center from the north at Oriol area and by Army Group South from the south at Belgorod area. The objective was an encirclement and destruction of Soviet Armies as well as recapturing the strategic initiative. \n\nOn the first day Army Group Center broke through the Soviet lines. In the area of Belgorod, Army Group South crushed the first zone of Soviet defenses and attacked Prokhorovka on July 12. \n\nHowever, the Soviet Army counter attacked at Oriol. The Soviet offensive took the German command by surprise. It immediately tried to solve the situation by partial troop redeployment fighting on Soviet Centre Front. On July 15 these troops with the support of units from the right wing counter attacked the Soviets. \n\nMission: \n\nTime: 11:30 am \nWeather: Clear \nVisibility: Good \n\nOn June 23, 1943, the 2.
