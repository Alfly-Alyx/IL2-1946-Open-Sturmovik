Pilots of Letka 13 actively participated in this conflict. The Luftwaffe pilots fought mercilessly over the Kuban beachhead with their Soviet counterparts of North-Caucasus Front, who were under the command of General Konstantin Andrejevic Vershinin. \n\nIn the battle of Kuban the Soviet High Command sought a strategic superiority before launching an aerial offensive in the Kursk area. The Luftwaffe had the same objective and transferred more units to the Eastern Front.  Luftwaffe aircraft losses that occurred during the winter of 1942-43 were to be replaced with planes from Germany, France, and Norway. \n\nHowever, it was the Soviet Air Force that gained a significant control over the southern part of German-Soviet front during this battle. \n\nMission: \n\nTime: 6:00 am \nWeather: Clear \nVisibility: Good \n\nOn June 10, 1943, Letka 13's home airfield became a target of a Soviet night bombing raid. One Bf 109 G-4, W. Nr. 19506, was damaged in the attack. \n\nIn addition to the threat of enemy air superiority, the pilots of Letka 13 also faced the frequent bombardment of their base from the guns of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet warships. \n\nOn June 12, 1943, an important staff change occurred in the leadership of Luftflotte 4. Its commander, General Wolfram von Richthofen, was replaced by General Otto Dessloch, the commander of Luftflotte 1. General Richthofen was appointed as the Chief Commander of Luftflotte 2 operating from Italy. \n\nAccording to the orders of Letka 13's commander, your task today is an escort of Romanian Ju 87 D-3 dive bombers belonging to Corpul Aerian Roman. \n\nObjective: Meet Romanian Stukas over Gostagaevskaya and escort them on their bombing run to Krymskaya area, which has been recaptured by Soviet Army on May 4, 1943. \n\n
