Short DEFENSE OF TAMAN HARBOR\n
Description DEFENSE OF TAMAN HARBOR\n\nDate: March 29, 1943 \n\nSituation: \n\nBetween March 17 and 18, 1943, Letka 13 has moved from Kerch to Taman airfield. Here fighting has grown in intensity. Unlike in previous months, there have been an increasing number of combat flights against the enemy. In proportion to the amount of flights, the score achieved by members of Letka 13 was growing.\n\nThe 50th jubilee kill was achieved by por. let. J. Gerthofer on March 21, 1943. This day at 11:28 am he shot down a Soviet twin-engine Petlyakov Pe-2 bomber in the area south of Myskhako. This was the first plane of this type shot down by Letka 13.\n\nFor this important achievement the Slovak fighter pilots received many congratulations. One of them was received from the Luftwaffe Commander in Chief, Reichsmarschall Hermann G\u00F6ring, and it was addressed to stot. let. Ondrej Dumbala: \n\n"I have received a report that the fighter unit under your command has achieved 50 aerial victories in a short time in our common fight against the Bolshevik enemy. This proud success of the courageous Slovak fighters, who have proved for most during the hard winter fights on the south of the Eastern Front, fills me with joy and satisfaction. My thanks and my special recognition to you and all your flight members and I wish you a lot of military success."\n\nIn this time, a change in command of II./JG 52 took place, when Hptm. Johann "Macky" Steinhoff was replaced by Hptm. Gerhard Barkhorn. \n\nMission: \n\nTime: 4:45 pm\nWeather: Clouds in 1200 m \nVisibility: Hazy\n\nSoviet IL-2 ground attack aircraft have attacked Taman harbor. Letka 13 is at readiness when a warning comes through of the attack by the IL-2s, and you immediately take off with ctk. Jozef Jancovic to intercept the enemy.\n\nCtk. Jozef Jancovic is one of the most aggressive pilots of the flight, and he has already achieved 7 victories. Today he is flying Bf 109 G, W. Nr. 14 830.\n\nHis life could have ended already on January 20, 1943. On that winter day he took off for a fighter sweep from Krasnodar airfield. During this flight he fought with an unknown Soviet pilot flying an I-16. J. Jancovic returned to base with an original trophy - a piece of wing marked with a red star, which had stuck in the fuselage of his plane!\n\nCtk. J. Jancovic is one of those air sharks, who does not think about his own safety. Well-meant warnings from his comrades are not serious enough for him. Nevertheless, he is an excellent fighter pilot, who has enough qualifications to become Slovak fighter legend.\n\nObjective: Divert the Soviet attack on Taman.\n\n
