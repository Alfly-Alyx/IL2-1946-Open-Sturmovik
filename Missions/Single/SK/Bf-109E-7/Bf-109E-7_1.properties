Short FIGHTER SWEEP\n
Description FIGHTER SWEEP\n\nDate: November 28, 1942\n\nSituation: \n\nThe battle of Stalingrad began on September 11, 1942, and has become a merciless and bloody slaughter. All parts of Stalingrad burn and the city has turned into a 40 km wide land of ruins. German Stukas arrive during the day and run amuck on the nests of Soviet resistance.\n\nOn November 16, 1942, the German divisions tried to reach the final victory, but without success.\n\nBy November 19, 1942, storm troops of the Southwest front under the command of Lieutenant General Vatutin and the Don front under the command of Lieutenant General Rokossowski are ready for a great assault. Attacks of the Soviet Southeast front broke the defense of Romanian units, and on the first day they have advanced 40 km towards the south.\n\nStorm forces of the Stalingrad front under the command of Lieutenant General Jeremenko have attacked on November 20, 1942, after heavy artillery fire. Troops commanded by General Tolbuchin and Lieutenant General Trufanov have broken through the German defenses.\n\nThe extremely difficult situation of the German armies near Stalingrad has called for all the available transport capacities of the Luftwaffe in favor of the 6th Army commanded by General Paulus. By November 23, 1942, the Luftwaffe began the preparations for supplying the surrounded German troops.\n\nMission:\n\nTime: 8:30 am\nWeather: Clouds at 1200 m \nVisibility: Blind\n\nBecause of the Stalingrad situation, the activity of the Soviet air force has significantly weakened in the operational area of your squadron. The headquarters of Army Group A has just decided that the supplying task will be given also to pilots of fighter units.\n\nAs a result, some of the Letka 13 pilots were assigned for purposes relating to the supplying of suffering ground troops.\n\nBut there are also tasks to be fulfilled on Kuban. It can be assumed that the Soviets will carry out air raids in this part of the front to disrupt the supply lines at their beginning.\n\nYour task is to perform a fighter sweep in a pair. If you spot enemy planes, attack them immediately. \n\nObjective: Fighter sweep in the area of Krasnodar - Tuapse - Novorossiysk - Krasnodar.\n\n
