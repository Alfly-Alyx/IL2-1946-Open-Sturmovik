Description Date : Januar 14th 1945\nTime : 11:15\nWeather : Clear\nClouds : 1500M\n\nGentlemen, last morning we have lost about four aircraft during dogfights with the Soviets above the Jennersdorf area. About ten minutes ago we have spotted a small spotter plane above our men located in the area. Most likely they will send in a group of bombers soon to enlight it. \n\nYour job will be to prevent it to happen.\n\nGood luck\n\n
