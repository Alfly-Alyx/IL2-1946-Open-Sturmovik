Name Bf-109G-14 N1
Short Dogfight mission against P-51D\n
Description \nDate: September 10th, 1944\nTime: 16:50\nWeather: Hazy\n\nScramble, scramble!\n\nAbout 10-15 Mustangs are strafing the Tapolca airfield! Take off as soon as possible and you might be able to intercept them as they fly back. Three of our best pilots will follow you. Hit the Mustangs hard and fast, and stay together at all times. You will be outnumbered at least one to two, so staying in formation is your only chance to survive. Try to avoid own loses!\n\n
