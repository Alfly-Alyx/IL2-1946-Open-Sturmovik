Description Date : January 1,1945 \nTime :10:00\nWeather: Blind  \nClouds : 1100 m\n\nGentlemen, just recieved a message from the high command. Lets see whats on it. Okay, Gentlemen listen up. One of our recon planes has just returned from the front and its report is as following. "I passed above target at a cruise altitude of 4500M at 198Kmh and have spotted large enemy formations in the Veszprem area moving towards our front. When looking at the speed of the enemy formations it is most likely they are preparing or even carrying out an offensive." As well I have received some photographs of the area and enemy formations which confirm. Your task will be to strike this target and prevent or stagnate the offensive. Further I would like you all to report yourself in the command vehicle next to the radio vehicle. I have requested some better examples of the photo's taken from the recon plane that I got so you can prepare yourself a little better for your upcomming task. I wish you guys good luck and a safe return.\nWe're hitting the American air base in the area! Aerial reconnaisance suggests that you will find a mix of all sorts of planes parked around there, anything from transport planes to Thunderbolts and Mustangs. Parked fighters are your primary target, with the second priority given to airfield infrastructure such as ATC towers and fuel dumps.\n\n
