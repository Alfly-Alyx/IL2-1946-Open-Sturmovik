Short Fighter intercept *1945\n
Description Date: March 1,1945\nTime: 11:00\nWeather: Clear\nClouds at 900 m\n\nGentlemen, due the enourmous enemy activity in the Szentgotthard area earlier this morning we expect the enemy to visit it again.\n\nIt is most likely that it will be a bombing mission. But be prepared to do some dogfighting as well.\n\nGood luck.\n
