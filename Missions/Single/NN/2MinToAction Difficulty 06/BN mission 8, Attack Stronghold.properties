Description [F4U] Buzzards Nest mission 8, Attack stronghold\n\nTake off from the Buzzards Nest and attack the German stronghold at Zusammen.\n\n4 Allied  planes\n8 Axis planes (AI)\n\n\nMission Briefing: \nWe need to prevent the Germans from bombing us again!  Several emergency requests for assistance were made of the American commander at the Wainwright airfield, but he seems to be absent and no one wants to step forward and authorize a bombing run of the Zusammen airfield or harbor.\n\nSince we have no idea how long it will be until we can get assistance with a bombing run we have to act ourselves while there is still a chance to catch them on the ground.\n\nYour mission is to fly out of the Buzzards Nest and attack the German bombers at the Zusammen airfield, thus preventing them from being able to bomb either the FFL fortress or the Caliph's compound.\n\nEnemy air support is expected to be present. It is advised to devise a plan to deal with this before selecting ordnance. \n\n\nPrimary Objective:\nDestroy the enemy bombers at their airfield.\n\nSecondary Objective:\nReturn to your position at the Buzzards Nest.\n\n\n\nFictional Mission, created by Blindman \n
