Name [F4U] Carrier launch and land advance training
Short Carrier launch and land advance training. Carrier is not moving.\n
Description Mission Briefing:\nCarrier launch and land advance training. Carrier does not move.\n\nTo launch:\nPut down full flaps, lock tail wheel, chocks away, stand on brakes while going full throttle, release brakes as soon as nose starts to fall.\n\nWhen just at end of deck raise nose just a bit, too much might stall you. Raise gear ASAP if having trouble launching.\n\nTo practice landing:\nAs soon as you have successfully launched quickly get to 100+m and 200+kph, if you put up flaps or wheels put them down, reduce throttle to 30-40% (37% is just enough to stay flying with flaps and wheels down with the corsair), aim at carrier wake while dropping in altitude to about 40 meters (you should now be about 1 km behind the carrier), raise nose to match conning tower while coming in (you should be just a bit to the right of center with deck, this helps avoid hitting the conning tower), DROP ARRESTING HOOK, you should now be coming in at about 30 meters and 180 kph or so (if you get below 18 meters you will have to hit the gas and go around), when you are just about at the deck be at about 20 meters and 170 kph, cut throttle and pull nose up to catch the deck with hook (don't pull up too steeply).\n\nOnce mastered try adding a bomb load or some gas tanks. Use the Full Mission Builder to change planes.\n\n\n\nby Blindman\n
