Name Balkans 7
Short A cry in the dark\n
Description October 28th 1940\n\nAlbanian-Greek border\n\n1920Hrs\n\nWeather : misty\n\nCeiling : 1200 m.\n\nDuring the last mission, one of your comrades was shot down... the Italian troops were able to locate him, but are unable to render any assistance.  It is on you that falls this last mission...\n\n-----------------\n\nBene !!!\n\nThe days reports are rather ambivalent... our losses were higher than foreseen, and the Greek resistance stronger than anticipated...\n\nNevertheless, we cannot keep you in the region...other skies await you...\n\nGreece will be a hard bone to gnaw... but the new replacements are not all bad!!!\n\nYou remember a short while ago... Capitano Angelini went down... and well, he was able to send a mayday call on his radio, and our troops have located him!!!\n\nHowever, they cannot go to look for him. They are fighting to consolidate their positions for the night...\n\nYou must go to recover him!!!\n\nEnemy air activity has been light, we believe a solitary plane has the best chance... You will take off flying one of the Stukas which the Germans lent to us and will recover our man.\n\nYou should find him on the South bank of the small lake situated to the South-East of Melissopetra (Soldatenkovo on the map).\n\nHe will light 2 fires as soon as he hears you, allowing you to locate his exact position.\n\nOnce you have spotted it, you will have very little time to land, and get him aboard your craft: in fact, the Greeks will be looking for him also, and if they see you it will not go well for either of you...\n\nYour mission: take-off at 1920Hrs, then set course for Melissopetra (Soldatenkovo on the map).  Next turn to the South-East heading for the small lake (o.Luzha on the map).  Once over the area, search the South bank, find the fires lit by Capitano Angelini, land and recover him.  Then, takeoff and come back to base.  Return to submit your report at the control tower while parking your aircraft near the ambulance that will be waiting for you.  Do it quickly!!!  After this flight, you will be able to take a well deserved rest before your return to Italy tomorrow.\n\nGood luck!!!\n\nPlayer aircraft : Ju87B2\n\nSkin : "2346-239aSquadrigliaPicchiatelliLecce... .bmp"\n\nAttention!!!  Mission without waypoints!!!  The player has 15 minutes to take off, go to the area and land close to the objective to help the downed pilot, then must return and land close to the control tower to complete the mission!!!\n
