Name Balkans 3
Short Cover Stukas\n
Description October 28th 1940\n\nAlbanian-Greek border\n\n1115Hrs\n\nWeather : clear\n\nCeiling : 1500 m.\n\nThe offensive continues... the Greeks, although outclassed in certain fields, and completely surprised by the Italians are in the process of gradually stiffening their resistance.\n\n-----------------\n\nBene, signori !!!\n\nThe enemy base was heavily damaged!!! Only 3 aircraft could take to the air, and they were shot down. A short time after your attack, two Squadriglias of FIAT BR-20s completed the destruction of the Greek installations. Their escort, of FIAT CR-42s piloted by veterans of the War in Spain swept all opposition. It would seem that at present, we have free reign in the area, at least in the air...\n\nOn the ground, the battle is rough, and the Greek troops, benefiting from the terrain, do not yield a meter without making us pay the price!!! Stukas will serve as flying artillery for us!!! You will cover them.\n\nYour mission : takeoff at 1115Hrs, then set course for Melissopetra (Soldatenkovo on the map). Stukas have the job of seeking out and attacking the enemy convoys of troops which are approaching South-East of this area. Cover them, and tackle any target of opportunity that you find!!! In theory, you need not worry about enemy fighters: their aircraft were swept from the sky, in this area at least. We need to take advantage of this and strike before they receive new aircraft from Athenes or elsewhere... on the other hand, they may attempt to force you higher with all the weapons in their possession. One more thing, if you could locate the area where they are concentrating their troops before sending them against ours, it would be a good thing... it must be somewhere along that road, but where???\n\nGood Luck !!!\n\nAnd on your return, a good meal will await you, to give you strength after this painful morning !!!\n\nPlayer aircraft : Fiat G-50\n\nSkin : "7293..."\n
