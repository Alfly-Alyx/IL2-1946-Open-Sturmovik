Description <ARMY NONE>\n\nDate: 13 February 1943\nTime: 14:30\nWeather: Good clouds at 500 m\n\n\nRussian offensive at Andreevskaya continues. In this moment 3,000 new troops are on their way to the front. Germans are in retreat near Kholmskaya. 2,000 fresh troops are heading to the front. \n\nGerman air strikes are currently most effective in Tuapse,Gelendzhik and Goryachiy Kluch.German troops are most vulnerable in Vishesteblevskaya,Taman and Kholmskaya.\n\nOperational situation for 13 February 1943:\nThe Soviet offensive goes according to plans. \n\n\n\nChoose your plane and check the briefing again</ARMY><ARMY RED>\nDate: 13 February 1943\nTime: 14:30\nWeather: Good clouds at 500 m\n\n\nComrade Officers!\nToday's mission will proceed as follows.\nFour of our I-153P will conduct a strike.\nThey will randevouz with 6 LaGG-3 S66 from Enem N., which will escort them to target.\n\n\nThe strike group will proceed to Kholmskaya where they will attack a German airfield. It's obviously a high priority target for the Germans, so you can expect serious opposition this time.\n\nDistance to target: 27 km\nFlight altitude: 1000 m\n\n2 LA-5 from Kalininskaya base are tasked with our next objective.\n\nTheir task for today is simple: keep the enemy planes out of the Andreevskaya airspace. Good visibility is reported at your assigned altitude, so stay fast and do some damage today.\n\n\n\n</ARMY><ARMY BLUE>\nDate: 13 February 1943\nTime: 14:30\nWeather: Good clouds at 500 m\n\n\nKameraden!\nAll right, listen up.\nThe first on our list are four He-111H6.\n2 BF-109G2 from Fedorovskaya will provide escort.\n\n\nThe strike group will pay our Russian friends another visit. They're long overdue for our special delivery in the Andreevskaya sector. Your primary target is the railway traffic there there. In the unlikely event of light enemy air opposition the escorting flight is authorized to leave the bombers after they drop their eggs, and attack additional targets of opportunity in the area.\n\nDistance to target: 31 km\nFlight altitude: 5500 m\n\nThe next group of our planes is 6 BF-109G2 from Kholmskaya. \n\nThe Kholmskaya area is just one of several high profile targets the enemy may attack, but considering their activity from the past several days I think your chances of seeing enemy planes are pretty high. However whether they'll be fighters, Jabos or bombers is anyone's guess. Good luck!\n\n\n</ARMY>
