You can of course expect heavy flak greeting you on the way there, so be alert and come home safe.\n\nDistance to target: 27 km\nFlight altitude: 1000 m\n\n2 LA-5 from Kalininskaya base are tasked with our next objective.\n\nTheir task for today is simple: keep the enemy planes out of the Andreevskaya airspace. Good visibility is reported at your assigned altitude, so stay fast and do some damage today.\n\n\n\n</ARMY><ARMY BLUE>\nDate: February 13,1943\nTime: 14:30\nWeather: Good clouds at 500 m\n\n\nKameraden!\nWe have the following tasks for today.\nFour He-111H6 will fly ground attack.\nThey will randevouz with 2 BF-109G2 from Fedorovskaya, which will escort them to target.\n\n\nThe strike flight will attack Russian supply trains in the Andreevskaya area. The enemy is increasingly more reliant on railway transport for their supplies. Thanks to their air superiority, attacks are very difficult and meet hell both from flak on the ground and fighters in the air. While there's little we can do about flak, the escorts can hopefully help the Jabos with the fighters. Good luck today!\n\nDistance to target: 31 km\nFlight altitude: 5500 m\n\nThe next group of our planes is 6 BF-109G2 from Kholmskaya. \n\nThey are to fly a CAP in the Kholmskaya sector, which has seen an increased amount of enemy activity in the recent days. No additional information on potential targets and enemy strength is available\n\n</ARMY>
