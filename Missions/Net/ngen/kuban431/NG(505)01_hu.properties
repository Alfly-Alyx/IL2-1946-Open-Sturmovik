It's obviously a high priority target for the Germans, so you can expect serious opposition this time.\n\nDistance to target: 27 km\nFlight altitude: 1000 m\n\nThe next group of our planes is 2 LA-5 from Kalininskaya. \n\nTheir task for today is simple: keep the enemy planes out of the Andreevskaya airspace.
