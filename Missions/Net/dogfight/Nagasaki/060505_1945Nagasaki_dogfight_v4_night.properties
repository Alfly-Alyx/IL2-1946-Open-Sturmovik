Also a hidden target.\nJapanese ships scattered throughout the map.\nJapanese have a large battle group complete with Destroyers, Battleships and 2 carriers at:\nAD-18.\n================\nJapanese also have ground targets in:\nAJ-18.\n============\nnote to all: After making several attempts at making this map, the distances to travel from USA bases to Japan just will not work and even bases on other islands and countries are too damned far away. So I put a base close enough as to enjoy the flying and fighting without having long boring disances to travel. hence, as unrealistic as it, is, the USA base and carrier are close so the map can be playable.\n=====\nAlso note:\nmany of the ships have been put to sleep for 90 minutes. After that, it's too late... or wil need a game reboot to quiet all down.\n=======\nRamstein\n\n
