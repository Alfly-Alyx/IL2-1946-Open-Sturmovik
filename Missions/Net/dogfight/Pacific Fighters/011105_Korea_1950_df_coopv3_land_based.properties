In spite of the declarations of UN, it seems that North Korea does not intend to obey the orders to withdraw. War will once again ignite in this area of the world, and is likely to transform the cold war which draws in the two large world powers one against the other, into a an extremely dangerous conflict. In the first week of August, the forces of the United Nations intervene, and thus land in South Korea to block, then counter this advance\n\n------------------\n\nOur supply ships have been detected at the rendezvous point.\nWe can expect trouble in the form of air attacks.\nIt will no doubt be Soviet pilots flying North Korean Migs, even if it is officially not the case.\nExpect to engage good pilots if you come across bandits. And if they locate our boats, it will be necessary to act quickly and properly, we can't afford to make mistakes. These guy know their job perfectly...\n\nF9F Panther (YP-80): protect the supply ships\n\nskin : "P-80 Navy Panther.bmp"\n
