While Germany struggled to isolate Leningrad, Finland attempted to protect its borders and soften the Soviet forces from the North and the Gulf.  Leningrad maintained an incredible AAA batteries enforced by battleships such as the Aurora, Marat, and Kirov.  Finland also used its navy for artillery bombardment and AAA protection. There are several ground and naval targets in this template.\n\nThere are separate bases for each original flight. Note that although Finland did not operate Stukas or He-111s, Germany did fly from some bases in Finland; so you can fly the types with German markings for accuracy and for varied gameplay.  Flying/enabling different flights will GREATLY vary your flight pattern, as well as ground attack opportunities.  WARNING: If you play for Axis, even if you do not enable AA, you will still be bombarded by naval AA.  If you enable AA, you will notice that the map is heavily populated around Leningrad. Keeping a historical basis, if you fly for Finland you will have a hard time surviving through the AA.  Flying around without paying attention WILL get you killed.\n\nNOTE: Now UQMG allows you to define the Air attack as well as Ground attack behavior for maximum flexibility. So you could have some aircraft conducting a purely air mission, while some conduct ground attack, and some may do both. DON'T FORGET to use the Cloning function to generate missions with large formations of aircraft beyond the 32 plane limit.\n\nObjectives: If you enabled mission objectives, then whichever flight corresponds to your flight number will be your primary target. That is, if you are flight No. 1, your primary target is Enemy flight Number 1. Your Primary mission is to destroy 100% of that flight. Any other flight that is 100% destroyed is a secondary objective. If your corresponding flight is not present, then your task is to destroy any target 100%.\n\n(ONLINE PERSPECTIVE: Objectives are for the Team that the mission was generated for. If you play for the 'other' team, your objective is to keep your opponent from completing his/her objectives. For example, if the mission was generated in single player for the Red/Allied team, then the objectives are for the Red team. For Blue team to win, it must keep Red team from completing its objectives.)\n\nSuggestions: Set high altitude missions starting in the air and add enemy gliders, then try to shoot them down. Don't forget to try to fly along with an Ace (if they have a flyable aircraft, you can fly in their group), or try one of the Tug/Glider combos, which can be selected with a simple click. Try setting up one or more flights in the same Regiment and Squadron so that you can communicate with them using radio and coordinate efforts.\n\nAlso, depending on the flight you choose to fly for, you can take off from a different base in the map.\n
