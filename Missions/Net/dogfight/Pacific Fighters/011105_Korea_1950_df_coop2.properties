USA Flies cover to protect planes so they can complete their crucial mission. Also there are many ships, Battleship, Subs and a carrier, and ground armor and vehicles including Tanks, Trucks, and cars. There is a column of tanks and truck on the road north of the Japanese Land air base and a Bridge which are targets.\n----------------------\nUSA:\n---------------\nAircraft:\n--------------------\nIncluded are many aircraft that saw action in the Pacific, including  the RAAF Seafire (for carriers).\n----------------\nUSA:\nCarrier Ops located at AB-13 on Map.\ncarrier aircraft include:\nP-80 using a Panter Skin, or other.\nF4U-1C 1945\n---------------\nOn carrier #2 at AB-9:\nP-80 (with Panther Skin)\nF4U-1C\nB25\n===============\n\nKorean AirCraft:\nA-20G, 1943\nLa-7 3xB-20, 1944\nP39 Q-10, 1944\nYak-3P, 1945\nYak-9Ut, 1945\nYP-80, 1944 (With Chinese Mig 15 Skin) until an actual Korean Mig 15 Skin is ever made/found.\n\n=============\nKoreans: Intercept the B25's and/or P-80's F4U-1C's before they reach their targets in Nagasaki, or other sites and bases in Japan.\nAircraft:\n\nAir Base Located AK-10. Also there are trgets just North of the Base including a bridge and Tanks. Also there are many ships and trgets on and around the islands in the area.\n----------\nKorean Carrier and it's aircraft located at: A-24\n------------\n2)A6M6 1943\n3)A6M5a 1943\n3)A6M5b 1943\n4)A6M5c 1943\n==========\nJapanese Ships, Fishing Boats (with guns) Destroyers, Battleships, and Subs are scattered about as both defense and as targets.\nNagasaki Harbor/Port has several targets, land and sea. Also a hidden target.\nJapanese ships scattered throughout the map.\nJapanese have a large battle group complete with Destroyers, Battleships and 2 carriers at:\nAD-18.\n================\nKoreans also have ground targets in:\nAJ-18.\n============\nnote to all: After making several attempts at making this map, the distances to travel from USA bases to Japan just will not work and even bases on other islands and countries are too damned far away. So I put a base close enough as to enjoy the flying and fighting without having long boring disances to travel. hence, as unrealistic as it, is, the USA base and carrier are close so the map can be playable.\n=====\nAlso note:\nmany of the ships have been put to sleep for 90 minutes. After that, it's too late... or wil need a game reboot to quiet all down.\n=======\nRamstein\n\n
