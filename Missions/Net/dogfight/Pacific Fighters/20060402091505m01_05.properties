Any enemy flights will target your corresponding flight numbers for interception if they are present.\n\nObjectives: If you enabled mission objectives, you are required to destroy at least 75% of your flight's corresponding target. Any other enemy column that suffers 75% loss is a secondary objective. If you enabled all targets to be present, then your mission is to destroy 75% of any of the enemy targets.\n\n(ONLINE PERSPECTIVE: Objectives are for the Team that the mission was generated for.  If you play for the 'other' team, your objective is to keep your opponent from completing his/her objectives.  For example, if the mission was generated in single player for the Red/Allied team, then the objectives are for the Red team.  For Blue team to win, it must keep Red team from completing its objectives.)\n\nSuggestions: You can have a lot of variety in these missions. In UQMB you can fly in any flight, not just Flight number one, and at that, you can choose to be a leader or one of the wingmen, depending on the number of planes you select. Just by choosing to fly in a different flight group you will have a different target. You could choose to start in air and have the enemy scramble from an airfield to try to stop you, or you can change the weather, altitude, or whether there are any enemy flights to begin with. Additionally you could set a delay time for the enemy or friendly forces to appear, generating a sort of 'wave' effect. You can also enable all targets, that way you have a larger ground attack battle.\n\nRemember, if you want dive-bombers such as the Stuka, Ju-88 or IAR-81a to conduct dive-bombing, set the mission altitude for at least 1500 meters.
