You select planes and if they see each other they will engage if it is proper. For example, fighters will attempt interception or dogfight, bombers will fly through their waypoints, gliders will attempt to land in a safe place, and seaplanes will fly to their water base landing area.\n\nObjectives: If you enabled mission objectives, then whichever flight corresponds to your flight number will be your primary target. That is, if you are flight No. 1, your primary target is Enemy flight Number 1. Your Primary mission is to destroy 100% of that flight. Any other flight that is 100% destroyed is a secondary objective. If your corresponding flight is not present, then your task is to destroy any target 100%.\n\n(ONLINE PERSPECTIVE: Objectives are for the Team that the mission was generated for.  If you play for the 'other' team, your objective is to keep your opponent from completing his/her objectives.  For example, if the mission was generated in single player for the Red/Allied team, then the objectives are for the Red team.  For Blue team to win, it must keep Red team from completing its objectives.)\n\nSuggestions: Set high altitude missions starting in the air and add enemy gliders, then try to shoot them down. Don't forget to try to fly along with an Ace (if they have a flyable aircraft, you can fly in their group), or try one of the Tug/Glider combos, which can be selected with a simple click. Try setting up one or more flights in the same Regiment and Squadron so that you can communicate with them using radio and coordinate efforts.\n\nAlso, depending on the flight you choose to fly for, you can take off from a different base in the map.\n
