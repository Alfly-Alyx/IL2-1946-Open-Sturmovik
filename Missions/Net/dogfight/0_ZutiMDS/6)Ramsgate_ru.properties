Description 6)Ramsgate \nSingle mission/online co-op(1hr)\n\nThese missions are designed to be used \nwith the map & map icons to simulate radar\nplus radio reports of enemy aircraft.\n\n29th October(the last day within the official\nlimit of the Battle of Britain) saw a change in\nstrategy - a daylight raid with a large fighter \nescort on Ramsgate harbour.\n\n"The Italian armada, then turned right in one\nformation and departed over Ramsgate - upon\nwhich 75 bombs were scattered at 17.45."\n\nAs we don't have the BR-20 at this point in time, \nI've used the Cant-Z1007bis. \n\nA big thanks to Zuti for making these missions possible & Hellzone, for starting the ball rolling.\n :-)\n\nAJD-NZ\n\n \n\n\n
