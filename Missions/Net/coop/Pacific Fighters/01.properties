Description <ARMY NONE>Choose your plane then check back here for your briefing.</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nDate: June 4, 1942\nTime: 04:30\nVisibility: 4/10, Scattered Clouds at 4,000 ft\n\nScramble, scramble! Our dawn patrol has just sighted an enemy carrier Northwest of Midway. They're within striking range, and will be launching planes any time. All available planes must proceed on magnetic heading 330 for approximately 10 miles, and do everything possible to take the enemy carrier out of action.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nDate: June 4, 1942\nTime: 04:30\nVisibility: 4/10, Scattered Clouds at 1,200 m\n\nGood morning. Operation MO begins today! Our first sortie of the day is a strike on enemy installation on the island of Midway. Americans may very well be sleeping when we arrive over target, which should give us some element of surprise.\nFour bomb-equipped kanbakus will take-off first and circle over the carrier, waiting for their escort of four kansens. Proceed on course 0-4-0. Midway is approximately 15 km away.</ARMY>\n
