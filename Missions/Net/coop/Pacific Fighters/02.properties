Description <ARMY NONE>Choose your plane then check back here for your briefing.</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nDate: September 15, 1944\nTime: 08:30\nVisibility: Poor, Scattered Clouds at 2,000 ft\n\nAs our invasion fleet prepares for amphibious assault on Peleliu, the Japanese defenders must be getting antsy, and probably crawling out of their holes. Four of our F4U fighter-bombers will fly an early morning search and destroy over the island, locate and destroy any targets of opportunity. \nFour F6Fs will fly patrol over our carrier.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nDate: September 15, 1944\nTime: 08:30\nVisibility: Poor, Scattered Clouds at 600 m\n\nGood morning. It appears the American invasion will start today, or tomorrow at the latest. We have to commit the last of our assets to the all-or-nothing fight with the enemy. Last of our serviceable planes must take-off at once while the sky above us is clear, and do everything possible to sink the enemy carrier. Make your homeland proud!</ARMY>\n
