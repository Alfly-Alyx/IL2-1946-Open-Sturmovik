Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nSEELOW HEIGHTS\n\nDate: 16th of April, 1945\nTime: 17:20\nWeather: Hazy\n\nAt dawn on April 16th, 1945, units of the 1st Byelorussian Front in the Seelow Heights area began their last major offensive of the war: the Berlin Operation. After a half-hour artillery barrage, infantry was sent forward with no tank or assault gun support. Impenetrable wall of fire from the defending Germans caused horrific losses, and the Soviet units were not able to move up the Heights. In the afternoon Marshal Zhukov committed both his tank armies into the fight, sending them into battle right over the backs of his infantry, and causing complete havoc. Under intense enemy fire Soviet units lost all cohesion, and became virtually uncontrollable. It became clear even to Zhukov that the offensive would fall behind schedule. \n\nFront HQ demands constant VVS presence over the battle area. \n\nYour Objective: \nStrike enemy defenses in the southern part of the Seelow Heights. To complete the task you are entrusted with the brand new design, the Il-10 Sturmovik.\nZveno of Yak-9UT's will escort the sturmoviks throughout their mission.

Our units took no casualties in the artillery strike, withdrawing to the second line of defense before it ever began, and watching thousands of Russian shells explode amidst empty trenches. The Russians advanced, but thousands of them were cut down on the approaches to the Heights without firing a single shot. At the moment, Soviets infantry and tank units have suffered tremendous losses, but their never-ending reserves keep advancing over piles of bodies of their comrades. Latest intel indicates that two entire tank divisions have just entered the fight.\n\nSoviet aircraft are constantly hanging over the battlefield, showering our positions with bombs and rockets. Despite shortage of fuel and other difficulties, we must fly and intervene. Theres nowhere else to retreat. Were the last line of defense between Berlin and the communists.\n\nA schwarm of Ju-87G-1 will attack enemy armored vehicles at Seelow Heights.\nBf-109\u041A-4s and Fw-190D-9s of the Stab Gr are to intercept any Red planes approaching the battlefield, paying special attention to any bombers.\n\n</ARMY>\n
