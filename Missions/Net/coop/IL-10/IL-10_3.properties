Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nBEEHIVE\n\nDate: 18th of March, 1945\nTime: 11:20\nWeather: Hazy\n\nListen up. Your task today is as simple as can be. Japanese kamikaze pilots can't be beaten once they get close to their target. You've all seen this: despite a hundred planes we shoot down, the hundred-and-first will get through and hit one of our ships. The only way to beat them is to make sure they never get off the ground. That's why we're hitting every airbase on this Japanese island here with everything we've got. The Army's plastering it with their B-29s, and we're showing them how it's done it with our F6Fs and F4Us.\n\nYour target for today is the airfield at Kanoya. You are targeting Japanese aircraft on the ground, before they can be dragged to safety. The F4Us are the designated strike group, and the F6Fs will provide top cover. Settle down; do your job first and then the Corsairs can come up for air combat, and the Hellcats can go down to strafe. Just keep your objective in mind.\n\nAlso keep in mind that you're the second group today that's getting this mission. The first got bounced by a large enemy force, and the strike group had to jettison their bombs in order to fight them off. So keep your eyes peeled for enemy fighters. The Japanese are still out there.\n\nGood luck!\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nFOREIGN WINGS\n\nDate: 18th of March, 1945\nTime: 11:20\nWeather: Hazy \n\nAir reconnaissance has just located a large enemy strike force to south-east of Kyushu. We assume that multiple enemy formations are already in the air, approaching Japan. The Americans are rightfully worried about our tokkotai units, and are trying to attack their airfields to prevent them from launching more strikes. Unfortunately the poorly trained and ill equipped Army pilots are unable to mount a challenge, so the Navy has to take the lead. \n\nEarlier today the Americans tried to attack Kanoya and Kagosima, however their attempt failed thanks to our patrolling fighters. Apparently, they're back for seconds. Our coastal watchers have reported another formation of fighter-bombers on a course to Kanoya. \n\nWe are ordered to take two flights of J2M5s from Kanoya and intercept the Americans. A flight of N1K2s will also take-off from Kagoshima, and proceed to Kanoya at full speed.\nYour main objective is to intercept enemy fighter-bombers before they can strike our planes on the ground.\n\n</ARMY>\n
