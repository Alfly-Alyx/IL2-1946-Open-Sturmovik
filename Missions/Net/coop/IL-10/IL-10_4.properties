Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nTAKE TWO\n\nDate: 22th of April, 1944\nTime: 10:30\nWeather: Clear\n\nThe city of Sevastopol has been in German hands since 1942, after heroically withholding a 250-day siege. We are now on the verge of retaking it. The frontlines in direct vicinity of the great city have stabilized, and we are now preparing forces to mount an attack on the city itself. Meanwhile, the Germans are evacuating, and some reports believe that in five days the city will be completely empty. However, other intel reports warn that up to two infantry battalions and some infantry have actually moved into the city.\n\nAfter a period of bad weather and rough seas that lasted for two days we finally received our fuel, and are able to mount more attacks on German naval convoys. About an hour ago two groups of sturmoviks made an unsuccessful attempt to strike a large German convoy approaching to Sevastopol. Your task is to destroy them at all costs, and prevent any ships from entering the Sevastopol harbor. It is unknown at the time whether the transports are bringing reinforcements in, or are going in empty to evacuate the Germans already inside the city.\n\nTwo zvenos of A-20s are taking off from Skadovsk. Over Saki they will be joined by fighters of the 6th and 11gh Guards IAPs. German fighters are usually wandering about the general area, so be extremely careful. \n\nLack of torpedoes at our warehouses forces us to load up your bombers with bombs. Skip-bombing is recommended.\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nTHE FINAL MILES\n\nDate: 22th of April, 1944\nTime: 10:30\nWeather: Clear\n\nThe noose around Sevastopol continues to tighten. Despite direct orders from the Fuerher, the XVII Army continues to evacuate all personnel from Sevastopol to Rumania. \n\nHorrible storm that raged on for two days finally gave way to clear skies. Eight convoys have left the port of Constanta earlier today, joining the five already at sea. The Red Air Force wasted no time to pounce on our transports. At 0930 this morning several Il-2s attacked a convoy that included the tanker Ossag, military transport KG 26, and the destroyer Ferdinand. A few minutes later another 18 IL-2s joined the battle. However the gaggle of Ivans was unable to do any damage, and succeeded only in giving the Kriegsmarine a bit of a fright.\n\nA flight of Bf-110s that provided top cover to the convoy has just returned from their mission with nothing but fumes in their fuel tanks. The convoy they protected is only 40 nautical miles from Sevastopol. The Russians are probably looking to strike the convoy again, and may involve better trained crews this time. \n\nTherefore an order was issues scrambling Bf-109s of III/JG52 and FW-190s of II/SG2 to patrol the coast along the final stretch of the convoys route. Be extremely vigilant. The Russians may strike with dive-bombers at altitude, low-level torpedo bombers, or a combination of both. \n\n</ARMY>\n
