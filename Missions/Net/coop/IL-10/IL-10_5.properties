Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nUNWELCOME GUESTS\n\nDate: 27th of June, 1939\nTime: 07:15\nWeather: Clear\n\nMultiple provocations by the Japanese Imperialists in the Khalhin Gol area have grown to full-blown battle by May of 1939. Units of the Red army have risen up to their internationalist duty, and joined the fight shoulder to shoulder with our brothers, the Mongolian peoples.\n\nFirst of our aerial engagements were unsuccessful due to the enemy's vast numerical superiority, and their pilots who turned out to be more capable than expected. New regiments are therefore being drawn into the battle to help tip the scales. \n\nScramble, scramble! A large formation of Japanese bombers with fighter escorts is approaching our airfield. All combat-ready planes are immediately to take to the air. A zveno of I-153s already in the air is to protect the take-offs of other planes on the ground.\nYour main goal is the destruction of enemy bombers.\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nELEMENT OF SURPRISE\n\nDate: 27th of June, 1939\nTime: 07:15\nWeather: Clear\n\nThe Soviet Union was able to draw us into a military incident near Nomonhan despite our best efforts to preserve peace. Hiding behind the Soviet-Mongol Mutual Assistance Pact, the dastardly Russians are now drawing large forces into the disputed border area. They fought desperate air battles throughout the months of May and June; and despite their poor training and inferior planes we were still unable to gain complete air superiority.\n\nOur HQ was able to develop new plans for defeating the Soviet air force. We will strike their planes on the ground, by mounting multiple simultaneous strikes on all known Soviet bases in the area.\n\nYour target is the Soviet-controlled airfield at Tamzak-Bulak. The first strike will be conducted by Ki-21s escorted by nine Ki-27s of the 9th Sentai. We hope that the Russians will be caught unawares, and you will bring home the victory in the spirit of Admiral Togos great triumph of 1905. \n\n</ARMY>\n
