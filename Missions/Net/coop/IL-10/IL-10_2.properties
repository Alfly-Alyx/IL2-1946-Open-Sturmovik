Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nPORT OF RASIN\n\nDate: 9th of August, 1945\nTime: 17:40\nWeather: Good\t\n\nSince the early morning our airplanes have been bombing the Japanese port of Rasin. Sturmoviks, dive-, and level bombers are constantly in the air over the target. However none of the previous sorties were able to achieve our objective, and many of our intended targets remain intact. The Japanese continue to put up fierce resistance, and their AAA batteries and fighters were able to claim several of our planes this afternoon. Escort fighters of the 16th IAP failed to obey their orders, and are therefore temporarily withdrawn from combat. La-7s of the 270th IAP will take over their duties.\n\nOur main targets at the moment are Japanese transport ships inside the port. None of them should be allowed to unload their cargo, or to leave the harbor. Our dive bombers are also targeting Japanese railways and rail stations in the area.\n\nYour Objective:\nTwo zvenos of Il-10s of 26th ShAP TOF will strike three Japanese transports moored at Rasin. Another transport and tanker in the harbor have already been disabled and lay dead in the water. Do not waste your ammo. Be aware of the AAA presence in the area, which we have not yet been able to suppress.\n\nFour Lavochkin La-7s will provide top cover. Japanese strength in the area is not fully known, so we cannot discount an attack by Japanese fighters. Be on the lookout.\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nTHREAT FROM THE NORTH\n\nDate: 9th of August, 1945\nTime: 17:40\nWeather: Good\n\nThis morning, the 9th of August, the Soviet Union broke our neutrality pact, and despite two months of our attempts to find peace, began an offensive long the entire Manchurian border. The reports are still sketchy, but at least two thrusts are apparent: one going along the coast towards the Korean peninsula, and the other going West towards Mudanjiang. Soviet bombers conducted several strikes on our bases along Manchurian coast, losing at least 8 planes. Ports of Rasin and Seisin have also been attacked by MTBs of the Soviet Pacific Fleet. The strike was as unexpected as it was powerful, we were unprepared for it, and are therefore losing the battle.\n\nPort of Rasin appears to be the favorite target of some Soviet general. The city desperately needs friendly fighter presence. We need to take all our Marus to sea, before the Russians sink them. We are desperately short of fighters and flak guns.\n\nYour tasks: take all available planes, numbering seven, to defend the port of Rasin. The flight of Ki-84s is to attack enemy fighters, while the Ki-61s are to protect the harbor from intrusions by enemy bombers.\n\n</ARMY>\n
