Description <ARMY NONE>\n\nDate : March 12th 1945\n\nPlease choose your plane and check the briefing again\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nDate : March 12th 1945\nTime : 9:30\nWeather : Good\nClouds : 1100M\n\nGentlemen, The enemy  fighters have just retreated from the airfield near Swiebodzin. However their ground troops are currently doing desperate attempts to regain controll of the situation.\n\nThis airfield has great strategical value to them  because it is located very near to the front and it allows us to attack us whenever they want to.  Another reason is that they don't have that much fuell left and the shorter the distance to the battlefield the better for them.\n\nHowever the same reasons count for us. Thus we are doing everything to get it.\n\nAt this very moment it looks like their panzers will be able to hold off our forces But  it won't be for long since we are deploying their reserves.\nIt will come in the form of motorized artillery, or tank destroyers. Su-100. Currently one of deadliest Soviet tank hunters availleble.\nIf they will reach the battlefield it is most likely that their front will collapse.\n\nHowever they will as well do attempts to stagnate them and prevent them from reaching the front by bombing them from the air.\n\nThat may not happon and it is up to you to defend them.\n\nGood luck\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nDate : March 12th 1945\nTime : 9:30\nWeather : Good\nClouds : 1100M\n\nGentlemen, our fighters have just retreated from the airfield near Swiebodzin.
