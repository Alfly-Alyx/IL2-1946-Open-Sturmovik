The Germans have done several attempts to intercept our recconnaissance planes but no luck for them. However Intel suggests that the Germans will take a new strangely shaped jet-powered aicraft into action soon.\n\nToday our target will be to recon above their airbases in the hope to catch a glimp of the new aircraft.\n\n</ARMY>\n\n\n<ARMY BLUE>\n(Note : This is an adapted version of Close their eyes originally released by Ubisoft with AEP),\nCLOSE THEIR EYES (Luftwaffe '46)\n\n14th September 1945\n\nEvery morning a pair of high flying Soviet reconnaissance planes escorted by fighters photograph our bases to count our remaining aircraft and assess the damage done by American bombers. Our attempts at intercepts have so far proved fruitless.\n\nHowever the failure of the Soviet Spring Offensive and the exhaustion of the Western Allies has given us time to develop new capabilities. Your mission today is to lead the first combat sortie of the new Horten jet interceptor and shoot down the Russian aircraft.\n\n</ARMY>\n
