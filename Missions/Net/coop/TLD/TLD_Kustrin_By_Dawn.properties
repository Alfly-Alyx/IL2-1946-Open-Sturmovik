BUT, Last morning when they arrived they took heavy fire from out of the Kustrin area.\n\nWe have been ordered to perform a sweep through the area and destroy the enemy artillery.\n\nHowever there is one downside to this mission.\nWe have no fighter support.\n\nSo that means we have to be in and out before the Luftwaffe shows up.\n\nGood luck\n\n</ARMY>\n\n<ARMY BLUE>\nDate: March 21,1945\nTime : 8:00\nWeather : Clear\nClouds : 1000M\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIntel suggests that the Soviets will attack our positions near Kustrin.\n\nWhat they exactly will do is yet unknown. But most likeley they will do an aim for our artillery there. They caused the Soviets some serious losses last morning so it is no wonder if they would like to see some revenge.\n\nYour job will be more than clear do an defensive patroll above Kustrin and destroy any enemy kite encountered.\n\nGood luck\n</ARMY>\n
