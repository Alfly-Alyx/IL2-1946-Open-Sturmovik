Description <ARMY NONE>\n\nDate: March 17, 1945\n\nPlease choose your plane and check the briefing again\n</ARMY>\n\n<ARMY RED>\nDate: March 17,1945\nTime : 14:22\nWeather : Hazy\nClouds : 1200M\n\nGentlemen,\n\nLast morning we have sended in several recon planes.\nTo study the area, especially the "Frankfurt an der Oder" area.\nHower against our expectations the Germans seem to have a fuel depot near "Boscow". We assume it is a fuel depot. But there could be amminutions as well.\n\nYour task is to take off and try to destroy the depot.\n\nWe do not know if the enemy will take off to intercept.\nIn that case I wish you a good milk run.\n\nHowever it is heavily guarded by flak so take cautious. And don't go in like a hippo in a porselain store.\n\nGood luck\n\n</ARMY>\n\n<ARMY BLUE>\nDate: March 17,1945\nTime : 14:22\nWeather : Hazy\nClouds : 1200M\n\nGentlemen,\n\nLast morning we have spotted severall enemy Recon planes above one of our ammo/fuel depots near Boczow. \n\nA small light armoured recon vehicle still near the enemy airfield has noted that the enemy is preparing for an assault.\n\nHe says that there will be no bigger bombers. However fighter bombers are most likeley.\n\nYour task will be to defend the depot and make sure no enemy will come near.\n\nGood luck.\n\n</ARMY>\n
