Name Landing Practice
Short Practice landing on a large empty airfield.\n\n
Description Mission Objective:\nPractice landing on a large empty airfield.\n\nSteps:\nSet the throttle to idle.\nPut landing gear down (go to options to set a command key or to see what is already set).\nSet flaps to land (set a command key for flaps up and down).\nYou should touch down at about 170-190KPH at a low angle, You may need to increase throttle to increase your speed or to slow too quick of a decent. If you go to slow you will start falling. (On the corsair 37% throttle will keep you from decending and lossing speed with full flaps and wheels down.)\n\nNOTE: Decent rate is controlled by the throttle at low speeds, using elevators decreases speed.\n\nOnce down pull back on the stick to keep your tail down and nose up. Tap the break to slow down (holding it down tends to bring your nose down).\n\n\n\n by Blindman\n
