Name Balkans 4
Short Attack Troop Concentration\n
Description October 28th 1940\n\nAlbanian-Greek border\n\n1530Hrs\n\nWeather : clear\n\nCeiling : 1500 m.\n\nThe enemy attack on your base was a quite nasty surprise... several fighters were lost, and more importantly good pilots lost their lives. But air operations have no respite.\n\nAfter having brought your aircraft back to base, you went to submit your report. It must be made!!!\n\n-----------------\n\nSignori !!!\n\nAlthough our base was attacked by the Greeks, you managed save your aircraft. As we mentioned earlier, our recon aircraft have located the enemy concentration point.\n\nIt lies at the edge of the small lake located to the South-East of Melissopetra (Soldatenkovo on the map). From there, the enemy columns of vehicles move up continuously towards the front located only a few kilometers away... our troops need to be relieved by the destruction of the enemy infrastructure...\n\nYour mission: takeoff at 1530Hrs, then set course for Melissopetra (Soldatenkovo on the map). Escort the Stukas following along the road which leads South-East. Pay attention to the enemy AA: the Greeks surely realize the importance of this vital artery!!! Within a few kilometers of the area is a small lake. On its northern bank you will find the enemy installations. Stukas have orders to attack and destroy them. Your wingman and yourself will provide cover. The Greek attack did not destroy too many of our fighters... nevertheless, there is good news: we will receive reinforcements... a new fighter squadron should be here on your return!!!\n\nGood Luck!!!\n\nAppareil du joueur : Fiat G-50\n\nSkin : "7293..."\n
