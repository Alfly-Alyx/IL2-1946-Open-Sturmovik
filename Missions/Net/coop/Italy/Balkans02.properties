Name Balkans 2
Short Destroy an enemy airbase\n
Description October 28th 1940\n\nAlbanian-Greek border\n\n0930Hrs\n\nWeather : clear\n\nCeiling : 1500 m.\n\nThe advance of Italian Army is rather slow because the ground is very difficult and our material is not the best... moreover, the Greek resistance is stronger than envisaged.\n\n-----------------\n\nSignori !!!\n\nRepeatedly the Greek airmen have surprised us... it is necessary to destroy their base. It is very close. In fact, a recon plane near Konitsa (Egorovo on the map) has spotted the largest enemy air base in the region.\n\nAccording to the reports, the Greek defenses there are rather weak. It seems they have not been able to finish their re-supply as of yet...\n\nWe hope therefore to surprise them in their nest !!!\n\nYour mission : Take-off at 0930Hrs, then turn to the East in the direction of Konitsa (Egorovo on the map). Provide cover to the Stukas and attack the base.  Next, continue South, bypassing mount Krasnopup.  You should easily find the Konitsa-Melissopetra road (Egorovo-Soldatenkovo on the map). It is very congested this morning: this is by Greeks attempting to bring troops to the border to stop us. Take advantage of your passage to strafe all that you find !!! All targets are fair game, and will relieve the pressure on our troops.\n\nGood Luck !!!\n\nPlayer aircraft : Fiat G-50\n\nSkin : "7293..."\n
