Description October 28th 1940\n\nAlbanian-Greek border\n\n1645Hrs\n\nWeather : misty\n\nCeiling : 1400 m.\n\nMelissopetra has finally fallen, the reinforcements of fighters have also arrived. This should give your mechanics some time to look after your aircraft. You will temporarily change machines and fly the planes of the unit of reinforcements since you have the advantage of knowing the area better than they...\n\n-----------------\n\nSignori !!!\n\nThe Greek defense has finally cracked!!!\n\nMelissopetra (Soldatenkovo on the map) has definitively fallen, and our columns of troops and armor are moving forward!!! Their goal: to control the road which the Greeks used to bring their reinforcements into Melissopetra...\n\nYou will provide them with fighter cover.\n\nYour mission: takeoff at 1645Hrs, then set course for Melissopetra (Soldatenkovo on the map). Follow the road which leads from there to the South-East. Our troops are close to the position attacked a short time ago. They must take possession of the small village which borders the lake on its northern bank. You will cover them until they are able to establish their positions for the night!!!\n\nIf all goes well it will be your last mission of the day. Tomorrow your unit and the Stukas will pack your bags and return to Italy, where you will set out again in one week for North Africa!!!\n\nGood luck!!!\n\nPlayer aircraftr : Fiat CR-42\n\nSkin : "9500-cr42.bmp"\n
