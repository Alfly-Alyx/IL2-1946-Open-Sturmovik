Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nAnother Blow\n\nDate: 10th of October, 1941\nTime: 10:00\nWeather: Fog\n\nThe Soviet Western Front is on the verge of catastrophe. German units seem unstoppable on their approach to Moscow. All available assets are thrown in the fight against the Third Panzer Group. The Germans continuously make small breakthroughs on various sections of the front, and the Red Army is barely able to plug the holes before its too late. The Air Force reports directly to the Front commander, and is currently ordered to fly direct support to ground troops. \n\nThe battle is currently underway on the outskirts of Medyn, where German attacks are held in check by the 33rd and 43rd Armies of the Western Front. Air Division HQ ordered I-153s of the 120th IAP to strike advancing enemy units at Medyn. Their cover will be provided by heavy fighters of the 95th IAP.\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nIn the Skies over Medyn\n\nDate: 10th of October, 1941\nTime: 10:00\nWeather: Fog\n\nIvan continues to crumble. Sometimes they run, sometimes they fight, and sometimes they even put up a temporary challenge, but the might of Germany is unstoppable. This morning our Third Panzer Army was bombed by Soviet planes, which momentarily halted their advance towards Medyn. General Staff demands no further delays for our Panzers.\n\nYour objective: \nBf-109Fs will patrol the Medyn airspace and prevent any further Soviet aircraft from penetrating. Bf-109Es will strike enemy artillery positions.\n\n</ARMY>\n
