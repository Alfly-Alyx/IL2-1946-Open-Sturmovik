Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nProtect the Convoy\n\nDate: 30th of May, 1942\nTime: 07:00\nWeather: Clear\n\nThe latest lend-lease convoy left Reykjavik on the 21th of May, 1942. The convoy is designated PQ-16. 34 cargo and 14 escort vessels have been spotted by the Germans on the 24th, and has been under constant attack ever since. 10 successive air raids sank six of the transports. On the 30th of May the convoy split up North-East of Kola Peninsula. The larger group is proceeding to Archangel; the smaller one into the Kola Bay.\n\nThe convoy is now in range of all enemy aviation, including even the Messerschmitts with their short legs. It is imperative that we protect the convoy from further air attacks. Your Pe-3s will fly medium-level umbrella, and disrupt any bomber formations attempting to approach the convoy. Your heavy fighters will be protected by a top layer of P-40s and Hurricanes.\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nDestroy the Convoy\n\t\nDate: 30th of May, 1942\nTime: 07:00\nWeather: Clear\n\nThe latest Allied convoy left Reykjavik on the 20th or 21st of May, 1942. Our U-boats spotted a large Allied convoy on the 24th of May, 1942. 34 cargo and 14 escort vessels had presumably left Reykjavik on the 20th or 21st of May. Our U-boats and FW-200s have so far sank six of the transports. The convoy is now in range of our Ju-88s and other aircraft. The convoy has just reportedly split up North-East of Kola Peninsula. The larger group is proceeding in the direction of Archangel; the smaller one somewhere into the Kola Bay.\n\nOur job today is to hit enemy transports on the approaches to Murmansk. Two staffeln of Ju-88s will conduct the bombing, and the Bf-109s will escort them all the way to the target and back. The convoy is reportedly screened by enemy fighters. Be on the lookout.\n\n</ARMY>\n
