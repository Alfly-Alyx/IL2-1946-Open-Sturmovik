Description <ARMY NONE>Choose your aircraft and then check back here for your briefing.</ARMY><ARMY RED>FIRST DAY\n\nDate: 22 June 1941\nTime: 0600\nWeather: Good, Clouds at 900 metres\n\nSince the early hours of this morning we have been hearing explosions to the south and north-east, yet so far our base has remained unharmed. Speculation is mounting in the absence of hard facts: can this be a German attack?\n\nIt is Sunday morning and those pilots on the base have been ordered to arm up and prepare for combat. Now at last we get confirmation - German bombers have been spotted south-west of us heading in our direction. Take off and repel the aggressor. </ARMY><ARMY BLUE>FIRST DAY\n\nDate: 22 June 1941\nTime: 0600\nWeather: Good, Clouds at 900 metres\n\nThis will be the second mission today for our Kampfgruppe and the target is a former Polish airbase now occupied by the Russians. Reconnaissance photographs show the base to be packed with fighter and bomber aircraft - destroying these will give us air superiority from the first morning of our new mission: Operation Barbarossa. \n\nFlight 5K+IM will attack the parking areas north of the runway at the target while flight 5K+MM (AI) will attack those to the south of the runway.\n\n</ARMY>\n\n
