Description <ARMY NONE>Choose your aircraft then check back here for your briefing</ARMY><ARMY BLUE>THE SEELOW HEIGHTS\n\n14th April 1945\nTime:  0830 hours\nWeather: Good, scattered clouds at 1200m\n\nBACKGROUND:\n\nThe Red Army has been held on the Oder since February, a combination of determined resistance and the enemy's need to resupply and reform for the final push on Berlin. Our defending forces include Volkssturm from Berlin, Luftwaffe ground troops pretending to be paratroopers, battered infantry "divisions" amounting in reality to a regiment or so and a few determined armour crews. These forces are being pounded by artillery and sturmoviks in what can only be a softening up process for the big Russian push on Berlin.\n\nMISSION:\n\nYou will attack Russian rocket artillery that is pounding our troops in Seelow from the east bank of the Oder. The attack aircraft will be a flight of Fw-190A8, escorted by a flight of Fw-190D9 fighters. Both aircraft were meant to have been used against American bombers, but the Russians crossed into the Reich three months ago and must be stopped.</ARMY><ARMY RED>THE SEELOW HEIGHTS\n\n14th April 1945\nTime:  0830 hours\nWeather: Good, scattered clouds at 1200m\n\nOur troops have been held on the Oder River for two months while we resupply after a hard winter campaign. German resistance is stiffening, though the enemy has as many old men and children in the trenches as combat veterans. A few determined armour crews lie hidden in the forest ready to counter-attack if we try to cross the river.\n\nNow we are stepping up the pressure. Bomber and sturmovik raids are mounted daily to soften up the enemy in advance of our attack. If we can cross the Oder we will be in Berlin within the month. The time for the great last attack is approaching.</ARMY>\n
