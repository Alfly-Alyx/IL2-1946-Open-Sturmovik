Our squadron is tasked with fighter suppression in advance of the raid.\n\nWe will fly to Szombathely airbase, home to the Hungarian Elementary Flying Training School and an unidentified German night-fighter unit and engage any aircraft that attempt to take off.\n\nOur aim is to prevent them from climbing to engage the bombers and to weed out their weaker pilots. No mercy - take the easy kills first then gang up on the rest.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>CLIMB TO LIVE\n\nDate: 22 August 1944\nTime: 0900\nWeather: Good, Clouds at 1100 metres\n\nRecent American air attacks on our bases have forced the dispersal of our fighters. Our squadron has been sent to Szombathely, home of the Elementary Flying Training School and a German Nachtjagdgeschwader.\n\nOur base has been placed on alert as American aircraft have been spotted flying north towards Slovakia. Now they have been seen over the western end of Lake Balaton and the squadron is ordered to scramble.\n\n</ARMY>\n
