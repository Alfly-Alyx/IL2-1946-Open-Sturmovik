Description <ARMY NONE>Choose your aircradft then check back here for your briefing</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>COVER THE ADVANCE\n\nDate: 03 January 1945\nTime: 15.00\nWeather: Good, Clouds at 1500 metres\n\nThe advance of our army around the eastern end of Lake Balaton has been hampered by the large number of blown bridges. The pace of the advance has now dictated that engineers repair these during daylight hours, a risky proposition given the still-active Hungarian and German airforces.\n\nYour two flights are to patrol the front line north-east of Lake Balaton and must protect the bridge being repaired north of Veszprem. Don't fly too close to it though - it is surrounded by our barrage balloons and AA guns.\n\nJust make sure it is still there at nightfall so our tanks can cross.</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>HOLDING BACK THE TIDE\n\nDate: 03 January 1945\nTime: 15.00\nWeather: Good, Clouds at 1500 metres\n\nThe Soviet Army is attempting to push round the easten end of Lake Balaton but is being hampered by all the bridges we have blown in his path. This morning, however, one of our fighters reported barrage balloons being raised around bridges immediately north of Veszprem. It seems the Russians want to bring tanks forward to join the infantry who crossed the river last Thursday.\n\nYou will attack the bridge under repair with a flight of Focke-Wulf Fw-190F-8 fighter-bombers escorted by a flight of Messerschmitt Bf-109G-14 fighters. Look out for enemy air patrols and make sure that bridge is wrecked.</ARMY>\n
