Description <ARMY NONE>Choose your plane then check back here for your mission briefing.</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>WINTER BOMBER\n\nDate: 02 February 1942\nTime: 0610\nWeather: Good, Clouds at 1400m\n\nOur cavalry has penetrated the German lines during the Winter offensive west of Moscow and has reported the location of a major repair facility for German tanks in Klimov Zavod. From their description this facility is housed in two factory buildings in the south-western part of the town and these building lie either side of three tall chimneys.\n\nThe cavalry warn that the site appears well protected by barrage balloons and anti-aircraft guns.\n\nOur attack will be made by three TB-3 heavy bombers escorted by a flight of I-153 fighters. Take-off will be just before dawn, so by the time you reach your target it will be light enough to identify the buildings and flatten them.\n</ARMY><ARMY BLUE>DAWN PATROL\n\nDate: 02 February 1942\nTime: 0610\nWeather: Good, Clouds at 1400m\n\nThe Russian Winter offensive west of Moscow has driven us back from the gates of the city but the intense cold of early February has brought a standstill to combat operations for both sides.\n\nYou are directed to perform a combat air patrol over the Klimov Zavod and Yukhnov sectors with a view to maintaining the safety of our troops and their snowed-in supply lines. Recent Soviet night-bombing attacks in Yukhnov destroyed a vital fuel dump and we have been ordered to ensure it doesn't happen again.\n</ARMY>\n
