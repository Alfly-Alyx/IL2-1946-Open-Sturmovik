Description <ARMY NONE>Please choose your aircraft and check back here for you briefing.</ARMY><ARMY RED>THE RACE FOR RAKOVO\n\nDate: 14 July 1943\nTime: 0900\nWeather: Poor, Turbulence at low level\n\nGerman troops on the left flank of their attack south of Kursk have been stopped by a minefield just south of Rakovo. It is rare that we get the opportunity to attack their tanks in the open so your flight of IL-2s and their La-5F escorts have been ordered at the last minute to destroy this valuable target. \n\nBe aware however that the Germans tanks will be protected by mobile anti-aircraft units and that they will have called for fighter cover. This will not be easy.</ARMY><ARMY BLUE>THE RACE FOR RAKOVO\n\nDate: 14 July 1943\nTime: 0900\nWeather: Poor, Turbulence at low level\n\nOur armour approaching Rakovo has been stopped by a dense minefield just south of the village and the army report Russian armour and vehicles just to the north. Your flights of Ju-87G-1 armed with the 37mm tank-buster cannon and Fw-190A-5 armed with bombs have been ordered to stop the Russian armour reaching the village and catching our troops in the open. With no option to manoeuvre our tanks are very vulnerable and the army needs you.\n\nThe village itself is lightly held but there have been reports of some anti-aircraft fire this morning. In addition you should expect to meet Russian fighter cover in the area.\n</ARMY>\n
