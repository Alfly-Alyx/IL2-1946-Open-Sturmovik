Suursaari is an important reconaissance base for us and prevents the free movement of German and Finnish shipping in the Gulf of Finland.\n\nYou will fly 4 I-16 fighters from our base on Moschnyi and cover our forces on Suursaari. The bright, cold autumn sunshine is perfect weather for the Finnish attacks. \n\nIf the enemy attack, target their bombers above all else.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nRAID ON SUURSAARI\n\nDate: 04 November 1941\nTime: 1600\nWeather: Good, Clouds at 1200.\n\nEnemy forces have occupied Suursaari island in the Gulf of Finland and are using its shores as a base for light reconaissance aircraft.\n\nLentolaivue 6 specialises in flying captured enemy equipment and today we will be using SB bombers escorted by Chaika fighters, both captured during the Winter War, to catch the enemy unprepared.\n\nYour mission is not to shoot down enemy planes but to protect the bombers at all costs. We are expecting considerable opposition from anti-aircraft guns and possibly patrolling Russian fighters.\n</ARMY>\n
