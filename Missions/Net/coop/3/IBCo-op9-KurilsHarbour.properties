Description <ARMY NONE>\nPlease choose your plane and check back here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nKURILE ISOLATION\n\n10th August 1945\n\nThe Japanese garrisons in the Kurile Islands are desperately short of fuel and food. Tens of thousands of troops are heavily reliant on the few remaining ships that keep them supplied.\n\nThis morning ships were spotted unloading fuel and ammunition at a makeshift dock. You have practised skip-bombing, now do it for real. Sink the tankers first.\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nKURILE LIFELINE \n\n10th August 1945\n\nThe Russians have launched repeated raids against our forces in the Kurile Islands. We are low on fuel and food and dependant on the few supply ships that break through the US submarine  and mine barriers.\n\nA convoy has just put into harbour and is unloading now. Get airborne and make sure it stays protected during this vital time.\n\n</ARMY>\n
