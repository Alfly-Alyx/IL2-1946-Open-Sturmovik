Their forces are driving forwards aggressively south of Berlin and the capital is in danger of being cut off. Our attempt to destroy it from the air this morning failed, so now its your turn.\n\nYour group consists of two Mistels and six escort fighters that weve scraped together. Youll have to hit the bridge if the army is to gain the time it needs to build Berlins defences.\n\n</ARMY>\n\n
