Yesterday the South-West and Don Fronts broke through Rumanian lines and started driving southwards to meet the Stalingrad Front which has advanced south of the city. Our ring of steel must be tightened very quickly if we are to trap the Germans.\n\nYour mission is to escort a flight of Su-2 bombers of 210 BBAP who will attack a Rumanian strongpoint in the village of Sirotinskaya. The Rumanians are using anti-aircraft guns to delay our tank advance.\n\t\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nRED PINCERS\n\n20th November 1942\n\nWhile the German Sixth Army fights in the ruins of Stalingrad, the Russians have broken through the Rumanian divisions stationed north and south of the city.\n\nOur reserve forces in the village of Sirotinskaya report tanks to the north of the village.
