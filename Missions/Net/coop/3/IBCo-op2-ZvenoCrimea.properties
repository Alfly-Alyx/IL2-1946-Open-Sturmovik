Description <ARMY NONE>\nPlease choose your plane and check back here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nDESPERATION\n\n5th October 1941\n\n===Warning: Air Start===\n\nThe German breakthrough in the Perekop Isthmus during the last days of September 1941 has placed the whole Crimea in danger. As well as scattering our army, the damage done to our air units in the harsh battles has been immense. Something decisive will be needed to slow the enemy down.\n\nReconnaissance has identified three Rumanian oil tankers unloading at Mezhvodnoe. Our remaining Zveno units and the IL-2s of the Pinsk Flotilla have been tasked with sinking them and preventing the oil from fuelling further enemy advances. Be aware  the flak and fighter defences are likely to be intense. \n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nUMBRELLA \n\n5th October 1941\n\nFollowing the hard fighting in the Perekop Isthmus, our rapid advance into the Crimea is stalling due to a lack of fuel. \n\nNow Rumanian tankers are unloading petrol for our Panzers at Mezhvodnoe. They are vulnerable while in harbour and the army have asked our Gruppe to provide air cover. Dont let them down.\n\n</ARMY>\n\n
