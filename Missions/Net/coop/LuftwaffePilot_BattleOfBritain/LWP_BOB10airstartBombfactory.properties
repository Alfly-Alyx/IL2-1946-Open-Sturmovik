Description Mid August, 1940\nOff the coast of England\n\n"Achtung Staffeln! Hier ist Kommandant Wick. Maintain altitude 6000m, speed 400km/h. They are 400km/h. Our Heinkels are making for the factories that produce Hurricane fighters so the better they do their job, the easier our job becomes!\n\nWhen the RAf come up to challenge us, fend them off but don't pursue too far. Our mission is to protect the bombers. They are our strategic arm and hold they key to subduing the Britischers so we must protect them. Stay with the bombers! That means you, Jedermann\n\nJudging by the amount of ambulances lined up at dispersal when we took off they're obviously expecting some casualties this time so keep those eyes open and call the fighters out when you spot them!Wick out."\n\n\nPaintscheme:BoF_standard_5\n
