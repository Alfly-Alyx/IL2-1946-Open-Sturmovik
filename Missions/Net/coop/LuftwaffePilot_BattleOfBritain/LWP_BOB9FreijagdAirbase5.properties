Description Late July, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" 1.e Gruppe,\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nGuten Morgen, \nWell, I must say you are all looking surprising chipper, considering the early start and the state some of you were in last night. Sad to have lost another young flyer, but Schalk would have been proud of the send-off we gave him.\n\nToday's mission is very straightforward. Jedermann. You are to lead three flights from 3rd Staffel on a Freijagd (free hunt)over Tangmere airfield. You will link up with two Schwarme from JG 26.  Your purpose is to lure the RAF up into the skies to be destroyed. Once their fighter strength is depleted, we will have air superiority over the Channel so our Landsers can make the trip across in safety. \nJedermann, with first flight, you will go in at 2000m as bait.  Gold flights two and three will follow at 4000m. Once first flight engages the enemy, flights two and three are to join in and close the trap. JG26 will be covering us the whole way.\nAttack any and all targets of opportunity but avoid  unneccessary risks. Expect the airfields and port facilities to be heavily protected by flak.\n\nCheck ditching procedures as usual and remember that the grid references are on your flight maps. Radio your location before ditching otherwise the rescue crews have the Devil's job finding you, even if they are almost on top of you. Remember poor old Schalk. \n\nGood hunting! \n\nDismissed\n\n\n----------------------------------\nAircraft: BF109-E4\nPaintscheme: BoF_standard_5\n\n\n\n\n
