Short Luftwaffe Pilot Battle of Britain\nReconnaissance mission to locate two radar sites.\n
Description August, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I.Gruppe\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nMorning.\nAt least this wretched weather is giving those poor bastards in the bombers a respite but I'm pleased to inform you that there is a mission planned for you today. Well, you'd only get bored if we just let you laze around.\n\nOne reason the Tommies are managing to hold us at bay is their damned radio-directional finding system, which they call "radar".  We need to blind them so that our bomber crews can get a free run in to the target. As it is,the RAF spots us forming up over France, puts the kettle on for another cup of tea then sends their verdammt Spitfires and Hurricanes up to intercept us. This state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue!\n\nToday you will be doing a one-man high-speed reconnaissance mission to identify and locate two radar installations on or near the Channel coast. We know for a fact that one is located to the west of Tangmere air field. There is reported to be a second one nearby, somewhere northwest of Portsmouth. Your primary objective is to pinpoint the position of these two facilities so that our Stukas and the new Jagdbomber versions of the 109 can wipe them off the map. \n\nThe weather at the moment is fairly murky so gain some altitude to avoid it- 4-5000m should put you above the worst of it and let you see something.. The weather may disguise you from the radar and as you'll be on your own I doubt they'll send up anything much in the way of opposition. Keep an eye out though. And double check your survival gear just in case you are brought down. One stray bullet or piece of flak shrapnel to your engine and you'll find the skies above the Channel to be a very lonely place indeed. The Channel will kill in minutes on a day like this.\n\nWell? Don't let me keep you. Get cracking!\n\nHeil Hitler.\n
