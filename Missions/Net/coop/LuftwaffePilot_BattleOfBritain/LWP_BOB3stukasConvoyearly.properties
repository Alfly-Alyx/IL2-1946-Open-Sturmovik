Description Early July, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I.e Gruppe airfield,\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\n"Freya" has  detected a convoy making a run into port under the cover of cloud and morning mist. St.G 1.e have been dispatched to make sure they are stopped. We shall deny the Tommies even the use of their own sea lanes. Their continued defiance will merely ensure they are left to wither on the vine until all their fight is snuffed out. Once this is done, our land forces can stroll ashore and add one more territory to the Reich.\n\nDon't expect much in the way of enemy air activity today. We can take heart from the fact that their air force is in tatters after their failures in France and the drubbings handed out to them in recent days. The complete destruction of the RAF as an effective fighting force is just days away!\n\nYour task this morning is to escort the Stukas to and from the target. Recent actions have shown up some major deficiencies in the Stuka when pitted against a modern airforce. Nevertheless, as aerial artillery they are strikingly effective so do your best to let them get their jobs done properly.\nThe Stukas will be at  4000m so fly top cover at around 6000m in order  to get the jump on any possible attackers.\n\nDismissed.\n\n
