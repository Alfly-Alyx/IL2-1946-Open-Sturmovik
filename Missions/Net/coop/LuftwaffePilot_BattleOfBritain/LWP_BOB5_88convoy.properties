Short Escort Ju-88's of KG 51 as they strike British shipping in the Channel.\n
Description \\Late July, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" 1.e Gruppe base,\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nGuten Morgen, meine Herren,\nAh, Jedermann, you seem to have shrugged off the effects of your little "dip" well enough! How is the Channel at this time of year? Anyway, glad to have you back with us. It's your round in the mess tonight and you'd better lay something on for the sea-plane lads, too! That goes double for you, Bergmann - two ditches in two weeks. You're running out of luck faster than you're running the Luftwaffe out of planes! Did Willy Messerschmitt send you to the Luftwaffe as a money-making scheme?\n\nJoking aside, in today's mission you will be escorting Ju-88's of KG 51 in their attack on a convoy of merchant ships bound for England. Make sure that our bomber boys have a free hand in their job. As we are all aware, the verdammt Britischers are putting up a a better fight than expected. They're over home ground which gives them a big advantage, too. That's why today we have to destroy as many of them as possible over the water along with the vital supplies that the ships carry. We in Fliegerkorps II and VIII along with the rest of the men in Luftflotte 2 and 3 already have an overwhelming superiority over the RAF. Let's extend that even further today.\n\nAfter taking off head 178 until you cross the coast.The Ju88's will be about 10km out to sea at altitude 2500m. You should encounter them south of the coast at about 0945. You are to fly at 3500m. Fly ahead and sweep away any fighter patrols the RAF might have mounted. Remember that our advantage lies in our speed, dive and firepower. Attack from the sun, strike quickly and be gone!\n\nHeil Hitler! Dismissed!\n\n
