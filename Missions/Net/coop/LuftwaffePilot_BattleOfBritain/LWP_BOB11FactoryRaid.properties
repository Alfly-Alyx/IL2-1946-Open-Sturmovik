Description Mid August, 1940\nNear the English coastStay with the bombers! Casualties among the bomber crews are mounting rapidly and morale is plummeting. Your task is to fend off  the RAF and let the bombers do their job. Don't get dragged away into dogfights with the British. Hit them hard in one pass then rejoin the bomber stream. You are not in this to rack up victories but rather to keep good men alive. Stick close.\n\n\nPaintscheme:BoF_standard_5\n
