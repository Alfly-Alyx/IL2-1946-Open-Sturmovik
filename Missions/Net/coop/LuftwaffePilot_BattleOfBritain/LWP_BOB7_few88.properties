Short Rendezvous with a flight of returning Ju88's from KG54.  \n
Description Late July, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I Gruppe base\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nGuten Tag, Jedermann, \nIt's been a hectic few weeks, I know, but today's mission is simple. You and our budding young ace, Schalk, are to head out over the Channel and rendezvous with some  Ju88's. They were shot up a little over England and the sight of some friendly aircraft will be a big boost to their morale. Link up mid Channel and escort them back over French soil. Once that's done, return to base as soon as possible.\n\nIn the unlikely event of ditching, radio your location and one of the floatplanes will be on the spot quickly to fish you out. Check your parachute, Mae West, marker flares and inflatable raft just to be on the safe side. Even in a summer like this, the waters of the Channel are no place to be. \nEmergency ditch sites that are frequently patrolled are in grids C-12, E/F-10 and K-7. There may be an E-Boat or floatplane in the vicinity if you're lucky. Don't ride your luck! And as always, keep a close eye on your fuel guage.\n\nDismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
