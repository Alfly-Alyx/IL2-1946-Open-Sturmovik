Name Luftwaffe Pilot_Battle of Britain2
Short Escort He111s on their mission to bomb British shipping in their \nChannel ports.\n
Description Early July, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I.e Gruppe airfield,\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nGuten Morgen, Fliegeren!\n\nFrankly I am surprised that you all look so respectable given the state you were all in last night at the mess. You in particular, Schalk. I'd never seen a person do that before! Most...um...educational. Jedermann, you'd better keep a close eye on this one - he's making you look old and boring!\n\nTurning to today's briefing, you will be flying escort again this morning. We're going after the ports once more, this time our target will be Portsmouth. Reconnaissance flights have reported a convoy is making for the port. We intend to give them a friendly welcome.\n\nTake off at 0828, climb to 4000m on bearing 185. You should rendezvous with the heavies from KG53 and KG 55, as well as a handful of BF110s shortly after crossing the French coast.  You may have to orbit the area as there are inevitably foul-ups in forming up.\n\nThe 110s will clear a path for the bombers. You are to fly 2000m above and behind the bombers. This will give you a better chance to pounce when the RAF come up attack. Expect resistance but don't be alarmed. So far the English have shown little taste for a real fight in any numbers.\n\nRescue flights will be operating to cover the return flight. E-Boats have also been dispatched and will be patrolling the designated areas indicated on your maps. Schalk! Bergmann! You paying attention? I do not want to have to write a letter to your wetnurses or Kindergarten teachers saying that their little princes won't be coming back. Watch out for Indians in the sun and monitor those fuel gauges!Jedermann - make sure they are sorted out. \n\nMeine Herren, your objectives today are two-fold. One is to defend the crews in the bombers. The second is to destroy as many of the RAF's precious fighters as you can. They cannot afford many losses. We mauled them badly in France. OKL expects they will be brought to their knees in just a few weeks. We will not disappoint them! Klar?!\n\nHunt well! Horrido!\nDismissed!\n\n
