Name Luftwaffe Pilot_Battle of Britain3
Short Attack returning Wellington Bombers\n
Description Mid July, 1940\nJG 2 "Richthofen" I. Gruppe airfield,\nBeaumont-le-Roger, France\n\nAchtung Fliegeren!\nCommand informs us that two flights of RAF Wellingtons are headed this way. They are returning to their bases after attacking port facilities, those cheeky bastards! That's our job! Spotters estimate them to be at around 3,000m so you'll have to climb hard to reach them. Remind them who controls the skies of France!\n\nNo heroics -  don't wait to see flames or wings coming off them. It's a long flight home across the Channel with damaged engines and shot-up crew members. Again, check your ditching equipment - life-vest, dinghy, flares - and should you be forced to ditch at sea, radio in and head for the areas marked on your flight maps.\n\nJedermann - you, Schalk and Meissner are on this one. Do us proud! We can't let good old Wick and that smug bastard from JG 26, what's his name.. .Galland?... get all the glory in this battle!\n\nGood hunting!\nDismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\n
