Description <ARMY NONE>\nB-29 vs. X-4.\n\nChoose your plane then check back here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nB-29 vs. X-4.\n\nDate: 1st of August, 1946\n          1630\nWeather: Blind\n\nA box of our Tu-4s (B-29s) is heading deep into German-held territory to attack the barracks of a German Panzer division. None of the new jet fighters assigned as their escorts managed to stay with them, either through lack of fuel or due to mechanical failures. \n\nYour single flight of short-range Yak-15s was diverted to protect the bombers, and you are all that stands between them and the entire might of the Luftwaffe. Defend the bombers at all costs.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nB-29 vs. X-4.\n\nDate: 1st of August, 1946\n          1630\nWeather: Blind\n\nA box of Soviet Tu-4s (B-29s) is en route into our territory. They appear to be unescorted. This is a great chance for us to use our new X-4 rockets!\n\nLerche: Scramble to intercept the bombers. Attack with your X-4s, then with your cannon. You will be greatly outnumbered. Expect to be bounced by the escorts.\n\nTa-183: You are already in the air, a fair distance away. Proceed towards the bombers and engage them with your X-4 rockets.\n</ARMY>\n\n
