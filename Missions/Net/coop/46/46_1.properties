Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nNEW THREAT\n\nDate: 29th of July, 1946\n          1535\nWeather: Hazy\n\nThe 2nd Ukrainian Front continues its advance; however it's hindered by a new German fighter-bomber, a heavy attack variant of the older Do-335. According to army intel, there's up to an entire squadron of these planes in the Borispol sector. 36th Guards Tank Army reports up to 40 supply vehicles destroyed by these attack planes in the recent days.\n\n5th Air Army orders that these new planes be destroyed in the air; as our current forces do not allow for a strike on their airfield. Your Yak-15 and I-250 fighters are dedicated to this task.\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nTHE RUSSIANS ARE COMING!\n\nDate: 29th of July, 1946\n          1535\nWeather: Hazy\n\nAfter suffering heavy losses on the Southern sector of the front, the Russians are concentrating their attack in the center. Hordes of armored vehicles are pushing through to Borispol; if they manage to take it, a real threat will develop in the entire Kiev area, and will put the entire Army Group Ukraine in danger of encirclement.\n\nWe've finally received prototypes of the new ground attack aircraft, the Do-335B. Two schwarms are ready to take off. Your targets are Russian supply columns near Rusanovo. You will be covered by four high speed Me-262s of II./JG52.\n\n</ARMY>\n\n
