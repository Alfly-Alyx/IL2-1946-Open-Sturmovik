Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nABOVE THE RIVER CROSSING\n\nDate: 23rd of June, 1946\n          1625\nWeather: Hazy\n\nUnits of the 2nd and 3rd Ukrainian fronts managed to take hold of the bridges at Kanev and Pereyaslav intact, and are now moving reinforcements over Dnepr at an excellent pace. The Germans are throwing everything they have at those bridges. Last night, after four large-scale bombing raids, they managed to destroy several sections of the railway bridge at Kanev. Today their attacks had no such luck.\n\nThe next patrol scheduled to cover the bridges will consist of six Yak-15s and four LaGG-3RDs. The Germans appear to have abandoned level bombers, and are instead attacking with faster, older Me-262s at low altitude.\n\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nCUTTING THE ARTERIES\n\nDate: 23rd of June, 1946\n          1625\nWeather: Hazy\n\nArmy Group Ukraine HQ demands immediate destruction of bridges over the river Dnepr controlled by the Russians. Yesterday's successful annihilation of the Kanev railway bridge is commendable, but another bridge still remains at Pereyaslav. The Russians continue to pull in more flak units and more fighters, so this task is becoming more difficult by the minute.\n\nWe have few forces available for the mission, which may play to our advantage by allowing us to mount a small-scale lightning-fast raid that might just slip under the Russian radar. Six Me-262As will strike the bridges, and four He-162Cs will cover them. Expect heavy presence of Yaks and LaGGs.\n\n</ARMY>\n\n
