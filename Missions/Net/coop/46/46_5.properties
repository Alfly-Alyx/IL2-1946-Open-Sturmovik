Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nTHE MASTERSTROKE\n\nDate: 9 \u0441\u0435\u043D\u0442\u044F\u0431\u0440\u044F 1946\n          1730\nWeather: Hazy\n\nGermans are launching V-1 rockets from the Fastov area. The plan for their destruction consists of three stages. The initial two stages have already commenced, and met with resounding success. The final stage will launch one more strike which will clean up remaining rocket installations, and also target enemy infrastructure in the area.\n\nDue to heavy losses in the preceding stages, only eight Il-10s and six MiG-9FS are available for this mission. Enemy resistance is expected to be light to none. \n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nREVENGE\n\nDate: 9 \u0441\u0435\u043D\u0442\u044F\u0431\u0440\u044F 1946\n          1730\nWeather: Hazy\n\nToday the Russians mounted large-scale air raids on our V-1 launch sites at Fastov. Up to 80 sturmoviks and fighters took part in those raids. More is to be expected. We must prevent more losses at all costs. \n\nSix Me-262HG-IIs and four Ta-183s are ordered to patrol the area. The enemy is using their newest fighter, the MiG-9. Try to concentrate on the Il-10s, and avoid attacks from the MiGs by using your superior top speed. \n\n</ARMY>\n\n
