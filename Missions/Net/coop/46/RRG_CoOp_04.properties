The convoy was unable to slip under the cover of darkness, and the VVS is launching an early-morning mission to sink the poorly defended transports.\n\nA-20C: Take off and proceed to target. Attack with torpedoes.\n\nIl-10: Take off and proceed to target. Attack with bombs, and with onboard armament if needed. Coordinate attacks beforehand.

Defend our transports! Concentrate on the slow and vulnerable twin-engine bombers, since their torpedoes are much more dangerous to our transports than the small bombs carried by the Sturmoviks.\n</ARMY>\n
