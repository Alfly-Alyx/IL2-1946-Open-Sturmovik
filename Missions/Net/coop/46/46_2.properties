Description <ARMY NONE>\nSelect your plane type and return here for your briefing.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY RED>\nRETURNING HOME\n\nDate: 19th of August, 1946\n          0720\nWeather: \u042F\u0441\u043D\u043E\n\nAttention! A zveno of Tu-4s of the 250th TBAP is returning home, and they request urgent assistance. They are dead and wounded aboard the bombers, and after a difficult mission the gunners are almost out of ammunition. We must help them get home.\n\nAt the time only six Yak-15s and a zveno of La-7Rs is ready to fly. All other planes will take a while to get ready. Scramble with all available planes, and head for the bombers. You must get to them before the Germans.\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nDOOMED\n\nDate: 19th of August, 1946\n          0720\nWeather: \u042F\u0441\u043D\u043E\n\nUp to 200 Soviet heavy bombers struck Rovno tonight. Our night fighters and flak gunners had a good night, claiming 19 of those planes shot down. \n\nGround observers reported that a small group of Tu-4s separated from the main flight, and are going home along a different route. They are calculated to cross over Obukhov at around 0730.\n\nThat prize is too good to pass up. We can destroy these bombers while they are at our mercy, virtually defenseless. A flight of He-162Cs and a flight of high-speed Me-262s are being scrambled. The bombers continue crying for help on the radio, so Russian fighters may show up eventually. Get there before they do. Los, los, los!\n\n</ARMY>\n\n\n
