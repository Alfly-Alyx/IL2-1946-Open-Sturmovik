Borispol airfield that's caused us so many problems is now firmly in our hands. 5th Air Army now controls two more excellent concrete runways, which the Germans failed to sabotage before retreating. \n\n294th Air Division is to defend the airfield until more reliable flak coverage is set up. HQ decided that at least one zveno of Yak-15s and one of MiG-9s should cover the airfield at all times. \n\nRadio intercepts suggest that the Germans may be planning an attack soon.\n\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nUNEXPECTED GUESTS\n\nDate: 17th of August, 1946\n          1315\nWeather: Fog \n\nWe had to leave Borispol in a hurry. Not only the runways, but even all of the hangars were left intact. Now they're housing Russian fighters. However, reconnaissance flight discovered that Russian flak still didn't get there, so the airfield is a perfect target. We must not waste such an opportunity!\n\nOur priority target is the flight line of the new MiG fighters. Six Ar-234s are sent to bomb them; they will be covered by six Ta-183s.\n\n</ARMY>\n\n
