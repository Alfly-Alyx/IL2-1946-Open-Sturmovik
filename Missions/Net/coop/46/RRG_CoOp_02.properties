Your target is the network of fortifications south-east of town.\n\nThe airfield nearby has been carpet-bombed early in the morning, so flak coverage is expected to be minimal. No enemy fighters are expected over target. Situation permitting, you may check the airfield for remaining targets of opportunity.\n\nWeather officer forecasts clear skies all the way to the target.\n</ARMY>\n<ARMY BLUE>\nIL-10S ATTACK TRENCHES\n\nDate: 29th of July, 1946\n          0900\nWeather: Hazy\n\nEarlier in the day our airfield at Heiderburg has been bombed by a large flight of Soviet level bombers. Their bombing was wildly inaccurate due to a high concentration of flak guns in the nearby defensive positions.\n\nForward observers now report a flight of Sturmoviks heading to Heiderburg, undoubtedly to attack our flak guns. Intercept them.\n</ARMY>\n
