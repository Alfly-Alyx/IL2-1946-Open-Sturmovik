Description Mission Briefing: \nYou have been invited to fly operations from the Buzzards Nest by the Commandant of 'The Lost Legion', the last of the French Foreign Legions. 'The Lost Legion' has a well-hidden stronghold in the Timbu Mountains and has enlisted a temporary supporter in their neighboring Caliph, who is sharing his compound with Allied forces for a second local stronghold. To date the Germans have no knowledge of the accumulation of Allied forces in the mountains, but that is soon to change.\n\nYour first mission flying out of the Buzzards Nest is to attack the German's Entgegen airbase to the South-East. Try to take out as many of their aircraft and supplies as you can and avoid leading them back to our two strongholds.\n\nOnce in the air keep low, take on a heading of 200 and keep in the mountains as long as possible before heading for the target.\n\n\nPrimary Objective:\nDestroy the enemy planes at the airfield.\n\nSecondary Objective:\nReturn to your position at the Buzzards Nest without letting the Germans know it is there.\n\n\n\nFictional Mission, by Blindman\n
