<RedColumn>	<The target of the strike is German transport columns at %s. I don't have to tell you how important these types of missions are for the overall situation at the front. We can hope to seriously disrupt German operations in this whole area if we keep their supplies from reaching their troops.\n>
<RedColumn>	<They are to proceed to %s, where the bombers will attack German transport columns. The roads in the area are feeding a very important section of the front. By attacking German supply lines we can greatly increase our chance of success in the overall sector.\n>
<RedColumn>	<The strike group will proceed to %s. Months of our efforts are finally paying off, and the supply situation is becoming a huge headache for the Germans. Keep the pressure up, seek out and destroy any supply convoys you may find. They will most likely be well protected and small in size. If you don't find any convoys, railway traffic is your secondary priority.\n>

<BlueColumn>	<The target for the strike group will be Soviet vehicle columns at %s. It's not going to be easy this time, the area is swarming with trigger happy Ivans. You can expect to receive plenty of flak throughout the mission. The escorts should protect the bombers at all costs! Expect constant harassmet from the air througout the mission as that sector is oversaturated with enemy fighters\n>
<BlueColumn>	<The strike group's objective is %s. The intelligence is spotty and we're don't know the exact situation around the target, but rest assured there'll be plenty of Ivans. Ground war has been quite hectic there lately, so expect all sorts of juicy targets scattered around the countryside.\n>
<BlueColumn>	<The strike group is to proceed to %s, where they are to seek out and destroy enemy ground vehicles, specifically supply trucks. Heavy enemy air opposition is expected, so stay low and fast to minimize the possibility of being seen. Good luck!\n>
<BlueColumn>	<Target: %s. Russian supplies can't seem to keep up with their advances, and this is a prime opportunity for us to give the Ivans an even bigger headache. Keep the pressure up on their supply lines, search for and destroy any supply convoys you may find. They will most likely be well protected and small in size. If you don't find any convoys, railway traffic is your secondary priority.\n>

<BlueColumnEsc>	<The strike group's target is Soviet convoy traffic near %s. Recently, our Jabos had heavy losses in that sector. Your targets are in a direct vicinity of a Soviet base, so you can expect a sizeable force to be scrambled to meet you. Good luck friends, I hope to see all of you back here when we return.\n>
<BlueColumnEsc>	<The strike flight will attack Russian vehicle columns reported moving through the %s area. Should no enemy fighters show up, the escorts can feel free to stick around an do some strafing of their own.\n>
<BlueColumnEsc>	<Their target is %s. With most of railroads destroyed in this sector, Russians now heavily depend on supplies by transport columns. That's what the Jabos are hitting today. Expect strong enemy opposition fron the air. They probably don't expect an escort of this size, and with luck they just might consider you a part of the strike force and not expect you to put up a good fight. Good luck! Bring home some victories. \n>
<BlueColumnEsc>	<The strike flight will attack Russian vehicle columns that have been seen moving through the %s sector. Because of the Soviet air superiority the enemy road traffic is so far conducted without the slightest precautions against air attack. Today we will teach the Ivans a lesson about arrogance!\n>

<RedTrain>	<The target of the strike is German trains at %s. I don't have to tell you how important railways are for supplies. We can hope to seriously disrupt German operations in this whole area if we put this rail yard out of commission.\n>
<RedTrain>	<The strike group is to attack German trains near %s. Hit any trains you see, destroy German troops and war material before they have a chance to fire a shot at our boys on the ground!\n>

<BlueTrain>	<The target for the strike group will be Soviet railway supply network in the %s sector. It's not going to be easy this time, the area is swarming with trigger happy Ivans. You can expect to receive plenty of flak throughout the mission. Railway remains to be the fastest way for the Russians to resupply their front-line troops. Fly along the railways in your assigned sector, seek out and destroy any trains you see. Be on the look out for Indianer at all times!\n>
<BlueTrain>	<The strike group will proceed to %s and attack Soviet railway traffic. The enemy has repaired the railway net destroyed by their own bombs and is using it to transfer supplies to the front. Today you will fly railway hunt and attack everything you see. Be careful, enemy fighters have to be expected!\n>
<BlueTrain>	<The strike group will fly railway hunt in the %s sector. Stay low and fast, and hopefully this will minimize your exposure to flak and decrease your chances of being spotted by Russian fighters. The area is swarming with Indianer though, so get it and get out as soon as you can. Good luck!\n>

<BlueTrainEsc>	<The strike group will pay our Russian friends another visit. They're long overdue for our special delivery in the %s sector. Your primary target is the railway traffic there there. In the unlikely event of light enemy air opposition the escorting flight is authorized to leave the bombers after they drop their eggs, and attack additional targets of opportunity in the area.\n>
<BlueTrainEsc>	<The strike flight will attack Russian supply trains in the %s area. The enemy is increasingly more reliant on railway transport for their supplies. Thanks to their air superiority, attacks are very difficult and meet hell both from flak on the ground and fighters in the air. While there's little we can do about flak, the escorts can hopefully help the Jabos with the fighters. Good luck today!\n>
<BlueTrainEsc>	<The importance of railway for the Soviet war effort cannot be overstated. The strike group is to attack Soviet trains in the %s sector. Hit any trains you see, destroy enemy troops and war material before they have a chance to fire a shot at our Landsers at the front!\n>
	
<RedTown>	<The target of the strike is German production facilities at %s. The factories are reportedly producing parts for the Focke-Wulf fighters. You may also see some completed examples during the mission. If they become a serious problem you cannot deal with on your own, try to request other friendly in the area to come to assist you.\n>
<RedTown>	<The strike group's target is %s. They will be hitting a staging area for the German troops traveling to the front line, and the nearby warehouses containing weapons and other supplies. It's a high priority target for the Germans, so keep your eyes peeled for enemy fighters and keep our losses down to the minimum.\n>
<RedTown>	<The strike group will proceed to %s. Their target is a strategically important warehouse complex there. Heavy flak is expected over the target area, so try to stay above it or well below it if you decide to strafe targets of opportunity.\n>
<RedTown>	<The strike group will hit German troop barracks at %s, which our intelligence indicates are being used to train flak crews. Let's hope they're not ready to graduate yet, as you'll have plenty to worry about from the Luftwaffe planes in the air.\n>

<BlueTown>	<The strike group will pay our Russian friends another visit. They're long overdue for our special delivery in the %s sector. Your primary target is the buliding complex believed to house their troops near the town center. Just like the old times! Let's show those bastards that we still have the strength to fight, that our beloved Luftwaffe is still the best air force in the world. Make the Russians feel the same terror that our women and children feel every day looking up at the sky!\n>
<BlueTown>	<The strike group's target is a Soviet warehouse complex located in %s. Our intelligence on the enemy strength in the area is very limited. We will actually rely on you to provide good information on the enemy defences.

<RedArmor>	<The strike group will attack an enemy armored division in the %s sector. Except very heavy flak over the target, so try to stay at a good enough altitude to keep out of harm's way. We have limited intelligence on the local enemy air strength, so we can't tell you much about what you will see there except the opposition should not be too heavy.\n>

<RedArmorEsc>	<The target of the strike is German armor at %s. The escorts are not given ground attack ordnance for this mission, however on their return trip they may descend and attack any soft targets of opportunity with machine guns.\n>

<RedArmorEsc>	<The strike group will proceed to %s. Their primary target is to destroy a Panzer division which has recently been spotted there. As you can see there are several German airfields within a short flight from the target, so expect small formations of enemy fighters to harass you on the way to target and back. The Germans favor attacking from the front in a high-speed pass, so the escorts may want to stay ahead of their package and intercept the Jerry before they can slice through our bombers.\n>
<RedArmorEsc>	<German Panzers are a huge headache for our boys on the ground, and the strike group are going to hit a large concentration of enemy tanks that's just been reported in the %s area. After the bombers drop their bombs, situation permitting the escorts may leave them to come down and strafe additional targets of opportunity. \n>

<BlueArmor>	<The strike group will pay our Russian friends another visit. They're long overdue for our special delivery in the %s sector. Your primary target is a Russian armored unit, possibly a whole division, which was recently discovered there on the move towards the front. Russian tanks are a huge headache for our troops on the ground. The enemy has not yet organized their air presence very well in the area, so you should not expect a high number of fighters to intercept today.\n>
<BlueArmor>	<Enemy tanks are advancing toward the frontline in the %s sector. There are simply too many of them for our ground troops to knock out, so we have to lend them a hand. Remember to drop your bombs with delayed fuse, or you can die for the Fatherland earlier than you might want!\n>
	
<BlueArmorEsc>	<The target for the strike group will be Soviet armor at %s. It's not going to be easy this time, the area is swarming with trigger happy Ivans. You can expect to receive plenty of flak throughout the mission.

Be careful, this area is known to be patrolled by enemy aircraft. The escorts should protect the strike group at all costs!\n>
	
<RedAirfield>	<The strike group will proceed to %s where they will attack a German airfield. It's obviously a high priority target for the Germans, so you can expect serious opposition this time.\n>
<RedAirfield>	<The strike group will proceed to %s to hit one of a few Luftwaffe bases still operational in our area. You can of course expect heavy flak greeting you on the way there, so be alert and come home safe.\n>

<RedBridge>	<The strike group is to destroy one of the very few bridges still intact in the %s sector. Our recon flight that photographed it early this morning noticed a flight of four Focke-Wulf 190's near the bridge, so we have to assume the Germans are aware of its importance and have a standing patrol over it. Be ready for high-speed attacks from the front which will most likely be mounted. Good luck!\n>
<RedBridge>	<The strike group will proceed to %s. Their primary target is a bridge marked on your maps. Most other bridges in the area are already out of action, so you will quite possibly encounter a lot of traffic going through the bridge. Its destruction should create a giant traffic jam, and present you with plenty of targets of opportunity stretching from the bridge Westwards. Good luck comrades!\n>

<RedBridgeEsc>	<The target of the strike is an important bridge near %s. After the bombers drop their load the escorts should asses the situation in the air. If the bombers are not actively engaged by the Luftwaffe, drop down and search for targets of opportunity in the area. Good luck!\n>

Hopefully this will kill two birds with one stone by destroying the tanks and halftracks that's recently been delivered there, as well as taking the station out of commission and preventing any new shipments of German war material.\n>
<RedRailroad>	<The strike group will attack an enemy rail yard in the %s sector.It's not the busiest yard in the region, but we've already bombed most of the important ones and the command is just going down the list. Light to medium flak expected, light to no air opposition. In other words, this won't be Schweinfurt, you guys can relax.\n>

<RedArty>	<The strike group will attack enemy artillery positions in the %s sector. Ground troops have tried to take those out of action a few times, but the guns are well behind the German lines and they keep moving back by the time our boys fight their way through. A few hundred men died trying to get those guns. So cook those Krauts extra crispy today, they've really earned it.\n>
<RedArty>	<The strike group will target enemy artillery positions at %s. We've had it on our list for a few days now but had to deal with higher priority assignments.

<BluePort>	<The strike group's target is a Soviet port at %s. The intelligence is spotty and we're don't know the exact situation around the target, but rest assured there'll be plenty of Ivans. This will be a dangerous mission. Lets try to get in, cause some damage and get out fast.\n>

<BlueRailroad>	<The strike flight will attack the %s railway station. Hopefully they will kill two birds with one stone by destroying the tanks and halftracks that's recently been delivered there, as well as taking the station out of commission and preventing the Russians from delivering reinforcements to the front so quickly.\n>
<BlueRailroad>	<Their target is %s. Their primary objective is to hit Russian supply trains and warehouses at the rail yard there. The Russians have started to repair the rail network they destroyed themselves and are using it to supply the front. We have to take the railways out of commision again. The Russians know very well that their supply lines are vulnerable to our attacks, so expect pretty sizeable opposition in the air.\n>
<BlueRailroad>	<The target for the strike group will be the %s rail junction. It's not going to be easy this time, the area is swarming with trigger happy Ivans. You can expect to receive plenty of flak throughout the mission. We have reliable information that for the past few days a whole Russian Tank Army has been arriving there by rail. Any trains you find in the vicinity will likely contain tank crews and brand new tanks fresh from the factories. Don't leave a single rail car intact.\n>

<BlueDepot>	<The strike group will pay our Russian friends another visit. They're long overdue for our special delivery in the %s sector. Your primary target is a large supply depot located near the town center. A very important target, so heavy resistance is to be expected, both from Flak and fighters. I expect some hits, Kameraden!\n>
<BlueDepot>	<The strike group's target is a Soviet warehouse complex near %s. What kind of supplies are stored there we are not told. In any case, heavy Flak and air opposition is expected. So go out there, drop your bombs on target so you don't have to go back there again, and do your best to come back alive.\n>

<BlueTroops>	<The strike flight will attack Russian troop positions in the %s area. Stay with the bombers up until they drop their bombs, and then make a judgment call whether it is safe to leave them and come down to hurt the Ivans some more. \n>
<BlueTroops>	<Their target is %s. Their primary objective is to hit Russian troop concentrations there. There have been massive enemy troop movements in the recent days, so in addition to your primary target you can expect plenty of targets of opportunity throughout the mission area.\n>
<BlueTroops>	<The target for the strike group will be Soviet positions at %s. I don't have to tell you how important each one of you is to our overall war effort. We don't have many planes to spare, and each mission you fly should have as much effect as possible. Do as much damage as you can, and come back safe Kameraden\n>

<BlueCrossing>	<The strike group's objective is %s. The intelligence is spotty and we're don't know the exact situation around the target, but rest assured there'll be plenty of Ivans. Ground war has been quite hectic there lately, so expect all sorts of juicy targets scattered around the countryside. Good visibility is reported at your assigned altitude, so stay fast and do some damage today.\n>
<BlueCrossing>	<The strike group will pay our Russian friends another visit. They're long overdue for our special delivery in the %s sector. Your primary target is a river crossing there.\n>
<BlueCrossing>	<The strike group's target is a Soviet river crossing located near %s. On your way there you might encounter anything from a single high-speed recon plane to a large bomber force protected by fighters. Stay fast and don't get distracted on your way to target!\n>

<BlueHQ>	<Their target is %s. Their primary objective is to hit a reported Russian HQ there. It's a rare opportunity for us to strike the beast at the head. Stay in the area for as long as you possibly can and wipe it all out. The Ivans should not expect such a concentrated strike, and you should have a high chance of killing some important officers and possibly even generals. Do your best, really let them have it this time Kameraden!\n>

<BlueHQEsc>	<The objective for the strike group will be a very important target: Soviet Headquarters at %s. Heavy air opposition is expected, but the Flak should not be too bad. If no Russian planes are seen after the bombers drop their eggs, the escorts can feel free to leave them and clean up additional targets around the area.\n>

<BlueArty>	<The strike group will pay our Russian friends another visit. They're long overdue for our special delivery in the %s sector. The enemy artillery battery there is causing our ground troops much trouble. They want it destroyed and we've got the job. Artillery guns are your primary target, then everything else.\n>
<BlueArty>	<The strike group's target is a Soviet artillery unit located near %s. The guns are well behind the front lines and they keep moving with the front line, staying out of reach our our forces. A few hundred men died just yesterday in the morning artillery barrage. So cook those Ivans extra crispy today, they've really earned it.\n>
